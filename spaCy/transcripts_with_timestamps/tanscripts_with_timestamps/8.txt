00:00 - hey!
What'S up you guys, so in this video 00:01, i'm showing you exactly how to create a 00:04 successful 00:04 online course step by step, there's so 00:07 much potential.
I see in the space 00:09, both in terms of passive income as well 00:11 as building a long lasting brand.
We'Ll 00:13 go through things like how to come up 00:14 with the content.
How to outline your 00:16 course 00:16.
The best ways to film and create your 00:18 videos, which platforms to sell your 00:20 course on 00:21 and how to market it.
This is the 00:23 comprehensive guide that i wish i had 00:25 before starting.
My own 00:26 first online course so make sure to 00:28 watch all the way through to get 00:29 the most out of it.
So the first step in 00:31 building an online course 00:32 is to come up with an idea for what you 00:34 want your course to be about 00:36.
There are literally infinite topics that 00:38.
You can make courses on and as long as 00:39 you're giving people an 00:40 actionable set of steps that they can 00:42 follow and, most importantly, get results 00:44 from then you should be good to go 00:46.
So one of the first questions that you 00:48 want to ask yourself is: can you get your 00:50 clients 00:50 results.
Think about the skills that you 00:52 have that you can teach 00:54.
I think a lot of people are like.
I don't 00:55 really know anything that i could 00:57 actually create a course on.
I'M not like 00:58, a complete 00:59 expert on anything.
But the thing is you 01:01 guys?
You don't have to be a full-on 01:03 expert at some topic in order to teach 01:05.
It you just need to have some experience.
01:06.
You need to be 01:07 more knowledgeable than others, and you 01:09 know how to format the course in order 01:11 to teach it the best 01:12 way possible.
This has to be a replicable 01:14 process.
You guys you're not just 01:16 teaching knowledge, 01:16 you're teaching, knowledge and then 01:18 you're also teaching them how to take 01:19 action and since knowledge and 01:21 information is everywhere and you can 01:22 find for free 01:23.
What really sets courses apart is the 01:25 ability for them to 01:27, get people to actually take the first 01:29 step and start the whole process.
01:31.
So definitely think about something that 01:32.
You yourself are knowledgeable about and 01:35.
Also ask yourself: 01:36.
Is there enough demand for this topic? 01:38?
What i recommend doing is going on 01:39 google trends 01:40 searching up the thing that you want to 01:42 create a course on and seeing if people 01:44 are actually searching for this type of 01:46 stuff.
You want your course to be niched 01:47 down 01:48.
Definitely, but you don't want to be so 01:50 niche that no one is actually interested 01:52 in taking it.
So what i recommend for you, 01:54 guys, is to come up with a list of 01:55 five topics that your course will be 01:57 about write, those things down and then 01:59 really think about 02:00.
What you can teach for each of those if 02:02, you think it is a replicable process 02:04, that you are able to teach 02:05, then put a check mark next to it.
But if 02:07, it's something that you can't really 02:08 teach or that you aren't really 02:10 interested in just cross it out for now 02:12 and narrow that list down to 02:13.
One topic that you want to start with so 02:15.
The second step in building your online 02:17 course is to 02:18 outline your whole course.
This is super 02:20 super important because i've seen a lot 02:22 of courses with 02:23 great ideas, but then you look at their 02:25 outline and it just does not make any 02:27 sense.
02:27.
Why they're teaching it in that specific 02:29 order?
Your outline is literally the 02:30 foundation of your course, and if you 02:32 don't get the outline right, then you 02:34 just can't build a good 02:36 solid course.
So, you're outlining it 02:37 definitely needs to be thorough.
The 02:39 order needs to make a lot of sense right: 02:41, you're not going to start teaching about 02:42 advanced topics at the beginning, you're 02:44, going to actually 02:44 first give an intro you're going to talk 02:46 about yourself, you're, going to talk 02:47 about what The course is about 02:48 and then you're going to go into more 02:49 beginner friendly things at the start, 02:51.
Then you're going to work your way: 02:52 towards 02:52, the whole process from a to z and that's 02:55, probably going to involve the more 02:56 complex and advanced strategies 02:58 near the end.
You'Ll want to break your 03:00 course into different modules: 03:01, and each module is going to have 03:03 different videos and different sections 03:05 that relate properly to that module so 03:07.
Now i'm going to take you guys through 03:08.
The outline of my first course 03:10.
My six figure youtube academy,
so if you 03:12 go to the landing page 03:14 scroll down, basically i have the whole 03:16 curriculum laid out 03:17 on this landing page.
So each of these 03:19 blocks is a module and you can see i'm 03:21 starting out with my youtube story: 03:23, starting on youtube: 03:24 audio retention.
What equipment works 03:26 best working my way, all the way down to 03:28 like seo 03:29 and editing workflow and then ending off 03:30 with youtube support 03:32.
So in each of these modules, i'll have a 03:33 bunch of different videos.
So if we go 03:35, look at 03:36, this first one.
I have two videos here: um 03:38.
This one 03:39 has five separate videos and then here 03:41 we have monetizing your channel 03:43.
Basically, all these videos are about how 03:45 to create income using your youtube.
03:47 channel 03:48 here is seo and keyword optimization so 03:50.
All these videos are relating to that 03:52.
I think spending a lot of time on this 03:54 outline was extremely extremely 03:56 important when building out this course 03:58.
Because, if you do your outline wrong 03:59, then the whole course is not going to 04:01 make any sense and your students are 04:02 going to be like 04:03.
What is this course about like?
Why are 04:05?
These steps in this order, 04:07 so definitely spend a lot of time.
On 04:08, this i'd recommend spending at least one 04:10 to three days 04:11 outlining your course.
The next thing you 04:13 guys need to do is to pre-sell your 04:15 course 04:16, and a lot of people will skip a step. 04:18 they'll spend hours and hours creating 04:20, their course 04:20 and then, when they launch it, no one's 04:22 buying it because well, no one knows 04:24 about it.
04:24 selling a course is actually a lot 04:26 harder than it seems because you know 04:27.
It'S hundreds of dollars, probably and 04:29, while some people might be interested in 04:30, the course, if you tell them about it 04:32, there really is a big barrier.
You have 04:34 to get them over in order for them to 04:36, actually commit hundreds of dollars 04:37.
To buy your course, what i recommend 04:39 doing, you guys is to test the demand 04:41 because, like i said before, you don't 04:42 want to build 04:43.
This whole course and have no one, buy it 04:45.
That would be a monumental waste.
04:47 of your time.
One really great way to do 04:49.
This is that you can actually sell your 04:51 course 04:51 without making the product.
Yet.
I know a 04:54 lot of my friends that are successful 04:55 with their courses 04:56.
They will not build the course until 04:58.
They, you know, sign up 05:00 x amount of people.
Another way that you 05:01 can do.
This is to just have an interest.
05:03 list 05:03 give people an incentive to join this 05:06 wait list and then, when your course 05:07 comes out, you can just do a big 05:08 marketing campaign towards that email, 05:10 list and hopefully that will convert 05:12 into some actual clients.
05:13.
Basically, that's what i did for my own 05:15 youtube course um.
I told people that 05:17 they would get a big discount if they 05:18 were to get onto the waitlist 05:20, and doing that i got over a thousand 05:22 people to join the waitlist, and that was 05:23 very, very important for my whole course.
05:25 launch.
05:26 email is extremely important and what 05:28 you guys will realize is that if you 05:29 want to 05:30 build a long lasting brand, you will need 05:33 to get emails because 05:34 email marketing is one of those things 05:36.
That has a very, very good roi.
05:38,
i mean you're, basically not spending any 05:40 money uh putting those emails out.
The 05:42 hard part is getting those emails but 05:43 once you get them 05:44 you're set now once you test this demand 05:46 and see that there is demand 05:48 make the course.
If there is no demand, 05:50 then rethink your course 05:52 topic and perhaps choose something else: 05:54 that might 05:55 sell better another great way to sell 05:57 your course before actually making.
It is 05:59 to create some type of freebie 06:01.
Now with a freebie.
This could be 06:02, something like a free pdf of the 06:04 best youtube niches.
Tell people that 06:06 you'll give them this freebie if they 06:08 enter in their email 06:09 and what that does is you're exchanging 06:11, that free information 06:13 for their email and, if they're 06:14 interested in getting that free, pdf, 06:16.
Well then, obviously they are interested 06:18 in your course 06:19 topic, so that should be pretty good when 06:20.
It comes to launching your course 06:22 and, of course, the other strategy.
This 06:23 works really well with 06:25 high ticket items that cost over a 06:27 thousand dollars is to create some type 06:28 of webinar.
A webinar is basically a free 06:31 lecture, where you give tons of 06:32 information, 06:33 tons of value to your audience at the 06:35 end of that webinar 06:36
you're selling them on your full price 06:38 course, and i find that that tends to do 06:40 really.
Well, for more expensive courses, 06:43
yeah
definitely tons of different ways.
06:44 that you can pre-sell your course, but 06:46 just know that 06:47, if you're making a course definitely 06:49, definitely don't skip the step 06:51.
You want to get those sales or the 06:52 interest list.
First after you pre-sell 06:54, your course the next step is to actually 06:56 create it, and i'm going to break this 06:57 down into three different parts. 06:59.
The first part is to create your slides.
07:01.
The second part is to film 07:03, and the third part is to edit all of it.
07:05.
Together now, when you're making your 07:06 slides, i recommend using something like 07:08 keynote or google slides personally for 07:10.
My own course 07:11.
I used keynote because i have mac and i 07:13 just thought it was a cool platform to 07:15 use 07:15.
Some people will try to make a course 07:17 without slides, but what i've realized is 07:19, that 07:19 people really want to view slides.
They 07:21 want to view 07:22 text as you're talking about it if it's 07:24, literally just yourself, 07:26 talking and nothing else, no supporting 07:28 text or anything like that.
Then it's a 07:29 lot, 07:30 harder for them to read and i feel like 07:31 you're able to give out a lot less 07:33 information.
So if you're deciding 07:35 between 07:35, you know not having any slides just 07:37, having a video of yourself, talking 07:38 versus having slides and having a video 07:40 of yourself in like the corner, i 07:42 recommend having the slides with at 07:43 least a little visual Of yourself now 07:45, this brings us to the question: should 07:47 you have 07:47 half page slides, or should you have full 07:49 page slides?
I don't really think you can 07:51 go wrong with either but 07:52.
Personally, for my course, i chose to have 07:55 half page slides, so basically half the 07:57 screen would be the slide 07:58 and half the screen would be me talking 08:00 to the camera i found out.
This is a 08:01 pretty good, hybrid approach, 08:03, because one, you still have a slide right: 08:04.
Half the page is a slide that you've 08:06 made in advance 08:07 and the other side.
Is you talking 08:08 directly to the camera, which increases 08:10?
The engagement so once you've made these 08:12 slides.
The next part is to actually 08:14 film yourself and with filming you can 08:16 either put yourself in the corner.
With 08:17, like a little box 08:18, you can have only your voice or you can 08:20 have yourself as half of the screen 08:22.
Now i know i said that for my own course 08:24 i had a half page slide: 08:26 with half page video of myself.
For most 08:28 people, i'd actually recommend just 08:30 having a full page slide 08:31 and having only audio or a little video 08:33 of yourself in the corner.
This makes it 08:35 a lot easier to film and you're, going to 08:37 be able to make 08:38 the course a lot faster.
It took me a lot 08:40 of time to fill 08:42.
My course i mean i love the way.
It looks 08:44 because it's really cool to have the 08:45 half 08:46 slide.
Half video look, but if i were to 08:48, do it again, i'd probably rather just 08:50 have notes 08:51 on the slides and just done some type of 08:53 voice over or having a little small 08:54 video of me 08:55 in the corner.
Reading the slide after 08:57, you film the course and, depending on how 08:59 long your course is, this should take 09:00, maybe one 09:01, two three days.
This is where you have to 09:03, edit it all together using an editing 09:05 software.
How i did it was, i recorded all 09:08, the video onto the sd card of my camera 09:10.
I took the footage from the sd card and 09:12 imported it onto a solid state, drive 09:14.
Then i edited everything together using 09:16 final cut pro on that external drive 09:18 after each single video was completed 09:20 and edited and exported 09:22.
I put that video into a folder that 09:23 corresponded with the right module that 09:25 video was in 09:26, and that was really how i organized it 09:28 on this drive for your first course 09:30.
All this is going to be pretty hard.
It'S 09:32 going to be really out of your comfort 09:33 zone, but i guarantee you once you make 09:35 your first course: 09:36, the whole filming the making the slides 09:38 the editing together.
This becomes a lot 09:40 easier, and your next course is going to 09:41.
Be a lot more simple to create okay, the 09:43 next step after you've, actually 09:44 made all your slides, filmed it and added 09:47 them into separate videos.
09:48 is to upload to a course hosting 09:50 platform.
Now, personally, i use kajabi 09:52.
This is a really great 09:54 all-in-one solution for hosting courses 09:56, but there are other platforms such as 09:58 teachable and thinkific and i'll link 10:00 them in the description below 10:01.
They all have their benefits and cons 10:03, but i really don't think you can go 10:04 wrong with any of them now.
The reason 10:06, why i chose to go with kajabi was 10:08 because 10:08.
This is a really great all-in-one, 10:10 platform.
It handles your email marketing 10:12.
It handles your landing page.
It handles 10:14, your 10:15 funnels it handles your whole community 10:17.
It handles your courses and i found that 10:19.
They had really great reviews.
So that's 10:20, why?
I went with them now the con with 10:22 kajabi is.
It is quite expensive, but they 10:24 always have a free trial for you to test 10:26 them out.
10:26 teachable and thinkific are really great.
10:28 too
they're a little bit cheaper, but 10:30.
They don't have as many features as 10:32 kajabi.
So now i'm going to take you into 10:33, my 10:34 own six figure youtube academy, hosted on 10:36 kajabi and just show you kind of what it 10:37 looks like.
So this 10:38 is my main dashboard for the product and 10:41.
You can see that 10:42.
Here'S the outline basically i've 10:44 created all these different modules, 10:46 and within those modules, i've uploaded 10:48 different videos 10:49 corresponding to them.
So if i click on 10:51, this video - you can see that 10:52.
Here you can upload any video that you 10:54 want.
So i can click video stats.
I can 10:57 click, remove video and re-upload a 10:58 different one 11:00, and i can set the visibility so right.
11:02.
Now it is published, so my audience can 11:04 see it.
11:05 um.
I can set the poster image and 11:08 here i create the title.
I create the 11:10 category 11:11 and then here i can write anything i 11:13 want.
If i do want to have a description 11:15 for the video 11:15.
Let me show you guys this particular 11:17 video um.
I actually have a description 11:19 here 11:20 and what you can also do is add 11:22 downloads.
So if you have like pdfs or 11:24 worksheets that you want your students 11:25 to actually work on, you can put that 11:27 right there.
But i can click preview here, 11:30, and it's going to show you what this 11:32 actually looks like 11:34.
So this is what the course looks like to 11:36, your students 11:38.
Basically, here is the whole outline of 11:40, your course with each video that they 11:41 can click 11:42 on, and then this is the current video 11:43 that they are watching and if they 11:45 scroll down 11:46, they get the title and they get whatever 11:48 description.
You wrote right there 11:50 and also, if you want to see my whole 11:51 landing page, that i created in kajabi 11:53.
Now it looks pretty good.
They don't have 11:55, the most uh 11:56 complex and professional, looking layouts 11:58, but i think that it works quite well 12:01 for my course - and this is basically the 12:03 landing page that i created 12:05 - you can see you can make all these 12:06 different blocks.
It looks good you can 12:08 have different colors different colored 12:10 buttons 12:11, and it's really optimized for getting 12:13.
Your potential student to actually want 12:15 to 12:15 buy the course here is my outline 12:18 and over here.
I have some more blocks 12:20 here and, of course, another enroll, now 12:23 button, so 12:24, basically
yeah.
This is what my whole 12:25 landing page looks like yours could be 12:27 different.
They have different themes, 12:28, that you can choose, but this is just an 12:30 example of one page that was created 12:32 using kajabi, okay, so now after 12:34, you've uploaded your whole course onto 12:36.
Your course platform - and you know 12:38 named every video organized everything.
12:40, the way it should be 12:41 now it's time to actually launch it and 12:43, hopefully get your first 12:45 sales.
This is why that pre-sale, that we 12:47 did earlier on 12:48, was so important right, because, if you 12:50 don't have that, then your launch is a 12:52 lot, 12:52, less likely to be successful.
Most of 12:54, your first 12:55 clients most of your first students - are 12:57 going to come from your email list.
12:59.
Unless you have a huge social media 13:01 following then, you might be able to get 13:02 students from there 13:03, but for most people, email marketing is 13:06.
The way to get your first students now 13:07.
What i recommend you guys try and do 13:09 is to run some type of promotion with a 13:11 big discount 13:12 for your email list.
Give them a reason 13:14, that they should buy it right now, 13:16 and give them some scarcity.
One thing 13:18, you can say, is i'm going to stop selling 13:20 this after three days, because this is 13:22, the initial launch - and this is my first 13:24 batch of students once you get sales in 13:26, those three days, you can close off.
13:28 enrollment. 13:28.
You know ask for feedback and actually 13:30 improve the course for your next 13:32 batch of students.
You'Ll notice that a 13:34 huge amount of your sales will come from 13:36.
Your initial launch and once that launch 13:38 is over 13:39.
You might not have sales for quite a 13:40 while - and this is where that continual 13:42 marketing of your course 13:44 comes in.
You want to always have people 13:46 discovering your course and getting in 13:48 on it.
One really great way to do.
This is 13:50 to have a freebie, like i said, 13:51 earlier, run ads to this freebie or run 13:54 ads to a webinar 13:55 and have them join it, and that way you 13:56 can get new leads for your course.
13:58 continuously create some type of email.
14:00 campaign that puts them on like a five 14:02 email drip and 14:03, always always email people you guys.
If 14:05, you email, someone once 14:07, there's no way.
They'Re gon na buy your 14:08 course, even if you email them like five 14:10 times, there's a very small chance.
14:12 they'll buy your course the best way to 14:13 convert.
These emails into sales is to 14:16, just 14:16 hit them with emails.
All the time i mean 14:18, you don't want to do it 14:19 too much where it gets super super 14:21 annoying, but you do want to continually 14:23 be marketing to them.
The next step after 14:25.
This initial launch is, you want to start 14:27, getting testimonials and really as 14:29 you're, making your course you'll realize 14:31, just how important testimonials are for 14:33.
Your conversions in converting potential 14:35 students 14:35 into actual students.
What i recommend 14:37 doing is reaching out to your current 14:39 students 14:40, asking them how they're liking the 14:41 course and then politely asking them.
If 14:43, they are willing to write you an email 14:45 with a testimonial 14:46, make you a quick video of themselves.
14:48 talking about the course 14:49 or even posting onto a facebook group, 14:51 saying how much they love the course 14:53 and also if they do have some really 14:55 great results.
Definitely have them talk 14:57 about that, because 14:58, those are going to be extremely helpful.
15:00 for your testimonials once you have 15:01, these testimonials, you can actually take 15:03 those videos or take screenshots 15:05 of whatever they're writing for you and 15:06 put them on your landing page 15:08, your checkout page and your emails 15:10.
Nowadays, everyone is looking for reviews.
15:12 and validation before purchasing 15:14.
Anything, especially if it's going to be 15:16 a course, that's hundreds of dollars or 15:17, even thousands of dollars 15:19.
They want to see other people get 15:20 results.
They want to see other people 15:22 saying good things about the course.
15:23 now, finally, guys once you've done all 15:25 the stuff.
You need to get 15:27 continual sales, because if you don't get 15:29 sales all the time 15:30, then your course is not performing that 15:32.
Well, i sort of mentioned this earlier 15:34, but there are 15:35.
Many different ways that you can 15:36 continually get new leads 15:38 for your course.
One is to run paid ads 15:41 on facebook, 15:42 on instagram and any other social media 15:44 platform.
One thing you can 15:46 have in those ads is to get them to sign 15:48 up for your webinar 15:49.
If they click on that ad, and it brings 15:51 them to a landing page.
That landing page 15:52 should either encourage 15:54 them to sign up.
For a webinar or should 15:56 give them some type of freebie in 15:57 exchange for their email 15:59.
These are more hot leads, because if you 16:00 know that someone wants a freebie, 16:02 related to your course content or 16:04 they're willing to sign up for a webinar 16:06 teaching about that exact same topic, 16:08, then they are way more likely to 16:10, actually want To buy your course 16:11 now i know i didn't really talk about 16:13, creating a webinar in this whole video 16:15, but that could be a whole video on its 16:16 own.
Creating a webinar is very complex, 16:18 and it'll.
Probably take you a long time 16:20 to do it but 16:21.
What i found is that for anyone selling 16:23 high ticket items, the webinar is what is 16:25 going to make or break your course 16:26.
If you create a good webinar with lots, 16:28 of great value and 16:30, a really good call to action to buy your 16:32 course, then man, you can make 16:34 a lot of great sales doing that so 16:36.
Definitely, if your course is expensive, 16:38 consider making that webinar and also 16:39 consider making that webinar.
If you 16:41, don't have a lot of organic traffic for 16:43 me, i do have a pretty big youtube 16:45 channel, so with that i 16:46 am able to create some good organic 16:48 traffic and sales, but guys 16:50.
This is really hard.
It'S not that 16:51 scalable and for most people that don't 16:53 have a social media presence.
16:55.
Just know that you don't need to have 16:56 that, in order to have a successful 16:58 course, you can absolutely 16:59 kill it running these ads.
Getting leads 17:02 by giving them a freebie or a webinar 17:04 and then selling it to them that way in 17:06 conclusion, you guys, i just want to say 17:08 online courses are such a great 17:10 opportunity for anyone that wants to 17:12 teach online 17:12 there's.
So much money to be made here 17:14 and it really can be a passive source of 17:17 income 17:17 for a lot of people.
Online education is 17:19, definitely trending up and in 2021, we 17:21 are going to see the most 17:23 core sales ever in the history of core 17:25 sales.
What i found is that people 17:27 really love learning through video and 17:29.
They are willing to pay 17:30.
Hundreds or even thousands of dollars to 17:32 do so.
What you do is you create that 17:33 course, once you spend a lot of time on 17:35, it 17:36 and after that you can keep selling this 17:38 course until it's outdated or you can 17:40 probably continue.
Selling it for even 17:41 longer if you're 17:42, always updating the course.
The biggest 17:44 thing is you want to give 17:46 value in it once you give a lot of value 17:47 in your course, people are going to love 17:49.
It they're going to tell their friends, 17:50 and you're going to get a lot of good 17:51 testimonials and in turn, that's what is 17:53 going to make 17:54 your course successful.
