00:00, hello, everyone - this is mo again and 00:03.
Today'S video will be different.
I get a 00:06 request to make a video about.
How did I 00:08 learn English
and I'm gon na share with 00:10.
You how I learned like the ways that 00:14 helped me to learn English.
It doesn't 00:16 mean you should only follow the ways 00:18 that I'm sharing I'll just share my own 00:20 experience.
So before I start, I just want 00:23 to let you know that I was taking 00:24 English classes for 12 years.
Their 00:27 teachers were not native speakers so 00:29.
When we were in class, they were using 00:32 Arabic to teach English and we did not.
00:36 speak English in class at all, so it 00:38 wasn't really helpful, so yeah.
Here we go 00:40.
I'M gon na share with you how I learned 00:43 English.
It all started when I went to 00:46 study abroad in the US.
When I went to 00:48.
The US, my English level, was really 00:51 really bad 00:52.
I only knew like hey.
How are you that's?
00:55.
All!
That'S really all what I mean.
I went 00:58 there with my cousin and we both were 01:00 helping each other.
We struggled a lot 01:02 trying to communicate and ask for help 01:06 or like buying groceries, or you know, 01:09 basic things.
So the first thing I did is 01:12 go into a language center and I took an 01:14 exam to decide which level my English is.
01:17
and I took the exam and I was in level 3 01:21.
I wasn't really confident in my English 01:23 level. 01:24.
I struggled a lot.
I feel I feel that 01:28 look, I failed a little.
I took their 01:30 level again then I passed then I went to 01:33 live at four and five on a personal 01:34 level spin.
I went to college, but even 01:37, though I passed all the labels and went 01:39 to college.
My first year in college was 01:42 really bad.
I did not practice enough 01:45.
Everything I learned think the Language 01:47 Center was only on paper.
You know I just 01:49.
We do homework then go back home.
Man 01:52 needs to be Kirby, like with my cousin or 01:55, like my friends from back home.
Didn'T 01:57 help me at all to learn English and that 02:00 take us to the second point, which is 02:03 international friends.
When I was at the 02:07 Language Center.
I only know like a few 02:08 friends, a few me known a tional friends, 02:11 and I wasn't really close to them.
I was 02:15 always really shy because of my English 02:17 had no making sense or not, and I think 02:22 stands for them as well.
Like we, both 02:24 were afraid to communicate.
I do not 02:27 speak their language, they don't speak my 02:29 language and you should be friends with 02:34, your classmates after school.
You can 02:37 practice what you have learned you all 02:39 will be in the same level.
So do not be 02:42 afraid to make mistakes or anything it 02:44 will really improve at least like with 02:46 listen and speaking, and that's all what 02:49 you need and thing is, do not be afraid, 02:51 to make mistakes 02:52
I'll, be around negative people who 02:54 always try to make you feel bad about 02:57, your skills, but you want to learn what 02:59 you want to achieve.
You can learn 03:01.
Anything without making mistakes so 03:03, don't be afraid, just be yourself, 03:05 practicing.
He is more important than the 03:08 things you learn in the language center 03:11 and that's.
The fourth point actually is 03:13 to practice.
The language center is only 03:15 like 30 percent of the process.
It'S all 03:18 up to you like a puppy.
You learn things.
03:21, are you gon na use them if you're not 03:22 gon na use, and then you can understand 03:24, even with me right now, 03:26.
I graduated, I feel, like my English.
03:28 skills are not as good as when I first 03:31 graduated, because I'm not using English 03:34 here practice practice practice until 03:37.
You get, it do not be afraid to make 03:40 mistakes.
03:40.
Everyone everyone makes mistakes, that's 03:43.
How we learn - and I felt my first level - 03:48 of level 3 area so fifth, one is TV, shows 03:52 highly recommend watching friends 03:55, because, oh, how they use English, they use 03:59.
It really slow, it's so clear and you 04:01 will have someone like Ross, who will 04:05 always correct people grammar and during 04:08 the show you can learn new words, new 04:11 phrases and slang, and you can use it to 04:14 practice as well.
Like you can pick up a 04:17 line, then you can practice it with your 04:19 international friends
so
yeah.
I think we 04:22 all grew up watching movies and English 04:24 TV shows.
So we picked up some words or 04:27 lines.
So we understand like a little bit 04:31.
That'S really good start to learn the 04:33 language, and the last thing I did is to 04:37 volunteer on campus.
I worked with the 04:39 International Center as events planner 04:41.
So there was like a lot of communication 04:44 with public speakers and our teams as 04:49 well, for example, marketing team to 04:51 market, the topic that we want to share 04:56 and it was like a weekly event.
We have 05:00 coffee, our every Friday from 3 to 4, so 05:04.
We will have a presentation - sometimes I 05:06 present myself or, like my other 05:08 colleagues and 05:11, it's really fun
and I think I help now 05:14.
In the end, it's not your first language.
05:16, it's okay to make mistakes do not be 05:18 afraid be with positive people really 05:22.
They will push you forward to achieve 05:25.
Whatever you want, you have to practice 05:27 to get to the next.
If you don't practice, 05:30 you're gon na lose everything you have 05:32 learned.
I feel like I'm losing a lot 05:34 because I'm not practicing here.
I don't 05:37, have anyone to practice with 05:38.
I only use English homework and it's not 05:41 perfect.
You know, like everyone is not 05:43 speaking English fluently just find your 05:46 motivation, learn the language and always 05:49 practice over and over over again, do not 05:51 be afraid to make any mistakes.
It'S. Okay, 05:53!
It'S not your first language that was 05:55 everything that I had for today's video 05:57.
I hope you found this video really 06:01 useful.

Thank you guys for watching.
I 06:11 will see you in the next one 06:16.
This video was really hard to make 06:18 because I made a lot of mistakes in 06:21 English to make the video you do not see 06:25.
What'S behind this is 06:29 [ Music, ]
