So if you haven't already download that 01:30, if you have 01:32, then just sit back and relax and let me 01:34 tell you the story about how i started 01:36.
My acting career, i think, as you start to 01:39, meet more people and meet more 01:40 actors in the industry.
You'Ll learn that 01:42 everybody has their own unique story, 01:44 about how they got started 01:46 and i'm no different.
I think my story is 01:48.
Pretty 01:49 unique and um ice didn't start the way a 01:53 lot of people did, because i'm not one of 01:55.
Those people that 01:57 watched a movie or a play when i was 01:59 five years old and 02:00 was mesmerized and wanted to be an actor 02:02 ever since i 02:03 actually didn't do any acting.
When i was 02:05, a kid didn't do any acting in high 02:07 school or in 02:08 college.
I actually went to college for 02:11 computer science and engineering.
That 02:13 was my major 02:14, and that was my degree and after i 02:17 graduated 02:18.
I was working in the corporate world as 02:20.
A software developer.
I actually 02:22 worked as a software developer for many 02:24 years, so i had a whole another life 02:26.
Before i started my acting career 02:29.
The way i got into acting was actually 02:33 because i was working in the corporate 02:35 world 02:36.
I had a job in this was in cleveland 02:38 ohio.
So i grew up in cleveland.
I went to 02:41 michigan for college and then i 02:43 came back to cleveland for uh for my 02:46 first job and 02:47.
Here'S actually a photo of me in my 02:49 cubicle trying to look cool as a 02:51 software developer 02:53.
This was back, i think, around, maybe 2008 02:56, or something like that 02:57, which is roughly when i started taking 02:58 acting classes.
The way i got into it was 03:01 that 03:02 me and my best friend from high school 03:03, who was also working a corporate job in 03:05 cleveland 03:07.
We would often meet up after work just 03:09, looking for something fun to do 03:11 after work.
Sometimes we would go to a 03:13 bar or a restaurant for a happy hour 03:15.
I remember we had even attended a few 03:18 toastmasters 03:19 meetings.
If you know what toastmasters 03:21 is, i also 03:23 signed up for jiu jitsu classes for a 03:25 period of time, 03:26 back then and uh at one point 03:30.
We having a walk by this acting studio 03:32 in cleveland ohio, and this was in april 03:35 of 2008.
03:36.
The acting studio was owned by jessica 03:38 hood morris, who was 03:40.
Actually, the teacher there, the head 03:41 teacher there and she also still 03:44, owns and teaches at that school.
If you 03:47 are in cleveland or near cleveland, ohio 03:49.
I highly recommend you check out her 03:51 acting classes.
03:52.
That'S the hood school of acting 03:54 h-o-u-d-e 03:55 school of acting in cleveland, ohio i'll 03:57, put a link to them down 03:58 in the description below i've.
Actually.
04:01 interviewed jessica hood morris here on 04:03.
This youtube channel 04:04 about the meisner technique, which is an 04:07 acting technique that they teach 04:09 at that school.
If you want to watch that 04:11 interview i'll put that down in the 04:13 description below 04:14 as well
but anyway, so me and my friend 04:17.
We happened to find this acting school 04:19 and we went to 04:20 a free class to audit and it looked 04:22 really fun 04:24, so we signed up for classes and i 04:26 remember when i signed up 04:28, i had zero expectations in terms of 04:32 uh, Making a career change in fact, 04:35.
There was not a single brain cell in my 04:37 head.
That was thinking that i would 04:40 pursue.
Acting as a career, i signed up 04:42 for those classes strictly because it 04:44 looked like it would be something fun to 04:46 do 04:46 and when i signed up, i was thinking 04:50 well.
It was a month-to-month type of 04:51 class, and i was thinking that i could 04:53 take classes for a month 04:55, see how i liked it.
If i didn't like it, i 04:57 would just 04:58 stop taking classes the next month or, if 05:01 i did like it, then i would just sign up 05:02 for another month and then another month, 05:04 and 05:05 um and just see how it goes well.
When i 05:08 signed up in 2008, i actually 05:10 kept taking classes there for the next 05:12 eight years so 05:13.
That'S how much i enjoyed those classes 05:16 and for that first 05:17 year
or so it was again strictly doing 05:20 it for fun.
05:21.
I had no expectations of trying to 05:24 get an agent or make money or any of 05:26 those things 05:27, but the cool thing was: is that that 05:30 acting class 05:31, whether i knew it or not?
At the time i 05:33 was gaining so 05:34 much experience and so much knowledge 05:36.
While i was in there because it was 05:38 that acting class, that i made 05:40 connections that was able to get me 05:42.
My first role in a short film and my 05:44 first roles in student films, 05:47.
It was through that acting class that i 05:48 got my first role in a play.
05:50.
It was through that class that i met my 05:52 first headshot photographer and got my 05:54 first professional headshot 05:56, and it was through that acting class 05:58 that i ended up getting my first 06:00 agent.
The way i got that agent was 06:02 because one of the students 06:03 in the class was represented by an agent 06:06 and she 06:07 introduced me to her agent and that's 06:09.
How i got my first representation.
06:12.
That'S also what i tell people is the 06:14 best way to get an agent 06:15 is through a referral, because that 06:18 carries so much more weight than if you 06:20 were to submit to an agent directly on 06:22, your own 06:23, but anyway, so that acting Class uh gave 06:26 me so 06:27 many opportunities before i even 06:29, imagined 06:30 getting the agent or making any money 06:33 and part of the reason 06:34.
Why?
I never had the idea of potentially 06:38 pursuing it as a career.
06:39 was because i was very naive to the 06:41 industry before i started.
Taking the 06:43 classes 06:44, i thought and i don't think i'm the only 06:47 one that thought this way.
I think plenty 06:49 of other people do especially people 06:50 - that don't really 06:51 know about the acting industry at all 06:54, but i just assumed 06:56 that everything that was made on tv was 06:58 made in hollywood 06:59.
I assumed everything that we saw on our 07:02 tv screen 07:03, any small, commercial or anything like 07:06 - that i just assumed was made in 07:08 hollywood.
07:08.
I never even considered that 07:12 local commercials for a local uh company 07:15, like a local car dealership 07:17, might be made locally.
I never considered 07:19 that, even though that makes perfect 07:21 sense that that would happen, but it took 07:23 me being in class to learn these things 07:25.
The way i learned was that i saw 07:27 other people in class other students in 07:30.
The class who had agents who were 07:31 auditioning for these types of things, 07:33, and i would see them on tv and that was 07:35 amazing to me.
07:36.
So that's how i learned about those 07:38 things that local commercials would be 07:40 made locally and they would hire local 07:42 actors 07:43.
So when i got my first agent in 07:45 cleveland 07:46, those are the types of things that i 07:48 started: auditioning for 07:49.
To begin with, because cleveland ohio is 07:52, a very small 07:53 market in terms of film and television 07:55 production, there are 07:56 zero tv shows being made there at least 07:59.
When i was there 08:00 - and there are - maybe there might be one 08:02 or two movies that come into town 08:05 per year.
So when i was there, 08:08 99 of the auditions that actors would 08:12 get 08:12 through, their agents would be for local 08:14 commercials or for 08:16 industrial videos and what industrial 08:18 videos are are 08:19 videos that are used by companies for 08:21 internal use.
Um 08:23, a great example of an industrial video 08:25 is a training video, so if you've ever 08:26 had 08:26 job at a company, and you watched a 08:28 training video on how to do your job 08:30.
Those actors in those training videos, 08:33, are acting in 08:34, industrial videos and i've done a ton of 08:36.
Those when i was in cleveland 08:38.
So that's how i got started.
That was my 08:41 first agent and those were the first 08:43 types of things.
I started auditioning 08:45 for 08:46, when i was when i got my first agent in 08:49 2009, so this was about an 08:51 a year after i started taking acting 08:53 classes.
I was still working my full-time 08:55 job and in fact i didn't quit my 08:57 full-time job for a long time, 09:00 from 2009 through 09:04, 2014, so those 09:06 four and a half years or so end of 2013, 09:10 beginning of 2014..
For those four and a 09:13 half years 09:14, i had an agent, but i was still working 09:16, my full-time job as a software developer 09:18, and what i would do is if i got an 09:21 audition 09:22.
I would go on my lunch break to do that: 09:24.
Audition
and then i would come back to 09:25 work 09:26 and then, if i ever booked a job, then i 09:29 would actually just take a day off of 09:30 work 09:30 and then do whatever acting job that i 09:33 booked, whether it's a commercial or an 09:35, industrial video 09:36 or something like that, and then i would 09:37 just come back to work the next day 09:39, and i did that for many years i was 09:41 working, my full-time job 09:43 and then every once in a while.
I would 09:44 have an audition and then every once in 09:46 a while, i would book something 09:47 and it wasn't until 2014 09:51 that i decided that.
Maybe i want to try 09:54 to do a little bit more 09:56 with acting so here's what happened at 09:58, the end of 2013 10:00.
I was just finishing up a 12 month 10:02 contract for my software 10:04 job and come january of 2014 10:07.
I had a decision to make.
I could either 10:10 take a new contract for my software job 10:12 or i could take a break and i elected to 10:15 take a break at the time 10:16.
My thought process was that i'm going to 10:19 take six months off 10:20 from my software job and try to focus a 10:23 little bit more on acting to see where 10:24.
That takes me 10:25, and i thought that i could do this 10:28 because 10:29.
I had saved up some money and i felt 10:31 like i was in a 10:32 financial position where i could take 10:34 that risk and devote more time 10:36 to my acting and the reason why i say 10:39.
That 10:39 is because, when i was working full-time 10:43 there were certain auditions that my 10:45 agent would send me that i would have to 10:46 turn down 10:47, because i was working on a high priority 10:50 project at work 10:51 that i couldn't leave for.
I couldn't 10:53 take uh our lunch break to go to that 10:55 audition and i 10:56 definitely couldn't take a day off a 10:58 full day off 10:59 from work to go work an acting job when 11:02.
I had this high priority project at work 11:04.
So there were certain times when i had 11:06 to turn down auditions and turn down 11:08 bookings 11:09, and this gave me an opportunity in the 11:12 beginning of 2014 11:13 to push my software job aside for six 11:16 months 11:17 to see what i could do.
If i focused a 11:19 hundred percent 11:20 on my acting career, my thought was that 11:23.
I was going to take it 11:24 six months at a time and if things 11:26 started going downhill 11:27, then i could always fall back on my 11:29 software career and go back to that job 11:31.
Well, that was 2014..
Now it's 11:34 2020 and in the past six years i have 11:37 not taken another software job since 11:40, then 11:40, so i've been really lucky and really 11:42 blessed to been to have been able to 11:44 fully focus on my acting career.
This 11:47 entire time 11:48 sure i've had side, hustles and side gigs 11:51 to bring in extra income 11:52.
But besides that, i've been able to 11:54 support myself 11:56, primarily with my acting career now, 11:58.
That'S how i was able to start my career 12:01 in cleveland ohio, but, as many of you 12:03 know, i currently live in atlanta, georgia.
12:06.
So how did i end up here?
Well back in 12:09, 2015.
So about a year after 12:12 i took my break from software and 12:15 started, focusing a hundred percent on 12:16 acting 12:17 in 2015.
I met two people from atlanta 12:21, two actors from atlanta 12:23.
Their names were alan o'reilly and jenna 12:25 cannell, 12:26 and meeting them really opened up opened 12:29, my eyes to 12:31 atlanta as a potential opportunity, 12:34 destination 12:35.
Because remember when i said before that 12:38, i was very naive to the industry and i 12:40 didn't know that 12:41.
You know local things were made in 12:44 cleveland, ohio well, 12:45, even after taking acting classes from 12:47 2008 to 2015 12:49.
I was still very naive to the acting 12:51 industry outside of my local market 12:54, so i understood how things worked in 12:56, cleveland and 12:57 in kind of the surrounding areas, but i 13:00 still didn't really understand how the 13:01 whole industry worked outside of 13:03.
Our market, i still thought that 13:06 movies and tv shows were all made in 13:09, hollywood, 13:10 right and uh.
It took meeting alan 13:13 and jenna to tell me that no, there are 13:16 other cities out there that have a lot 13:18 of film and television production 13:20 and since they were from atlanta, they 13:22 really opened my eyes to what was going 13:24 on 13:24.
In atlanta, so when they told me about 13:26 that i started researching it 13:27, and that was when i really 13:31 started considering moving down to 13:34 atlanta 13:35, and it didn't take long after that.
Only 13:37, a few months later in 2016 13:40, was when i decided to make the move and 13:43 come down here to 13:44 atlanta.
The reason i made the move was 13:46 because when i was in cleveland ohio, 13:48 yeah, i wanted to audition for movies and 13:50 television shows i wanted to work on 13:52 movies and television shows 13:54.
Those opportunities just didn't exist.
13:56.
There 13:57, the video that i just made last week was 14:00 about 14:01.
What'S the best city to pursue an acting 14:04 career 14:05 and where you live does matter because 14:08, certain cities have more film and 14:10 television production than others, 14:12 and atlanta happens to be one of those 14:15 cities and cleveland 14:16 doesn't happen to be one Of those cities 14:18.
So when i was in cleveland 14:20, i wanted to audition for movies and 14:21 shows, but there was just not that 14:23 opportunity.
I might get 14:25 one audition for a movie per year, if 14:27, that sometimes 14:28 zero auditions for movies and definitely 14:31 no auditions for tv shows the entire 14:33 time that i was there 14:35.
Once i moved to atlanta a much bigger 14:38 production market 14:39.
A lot of movies and shows are made here 14:41.
I started getting auditions for movies 14:44 and shows every week often multiple 14:46 times a week 14:48.
So, instead of one audition for a movie 14:50 per year 14:51, it was an audition every week for a 14:54 movie, so 14:54 it was very v.
It was such a drastic, 14:57 change.
14:58.
From what i was used to this move to 15:00 atlanta was that next step 15:02 that my career needed.
If you look at my 15:05 imdb 15:05 profile, you'll see that all of the 15:08 movies and television shows that i've 15:10 worked on 15:11 they've all been from 2016 onwards, 15:14.
Everything before that most of it was 15:16 just short, films, 15:17 and projects that i worked on with my 15:20 friends 15:20.
So this move to atlanta was a huge 15:23 change 15:24 for my career, and one thing that i want 15:26 to mention is that this entire time 15:28 since 2008, i never stopped taking acting 15:31 classes 15:32 from that first day forward.
I always 15:35 continued to take classes.
15:36.
I didn't stop.
When i got my agent, i 15:39 didn't stop when i booked my first job 15:41.
I didn't stop.
When i got my first movie 15:43 or my first television show 15:44.
I continued to take acting classes.
All 15:47 the way through and 15:48.
That'S because i really believe in this 15:49.
I really believe that actors need to 15:52 continue their training throughout their 15:54 careers 15:54, because there's always something new to 15:56 learn, there's always something to 15:58 improve, and i feel like that is a huge 16:01 reason.
16:01 for the successes that i've had, and the 16:04 reason i still 16:05 take acting classes - is that i know that 16:07.
I still have so much more room to grow 16:10 in my career, i'm nowhere near what i 16:13 think my potential can be 16:15.
For example, i just had my first lead 16:17 role in a feature film that came out 16:19 this month, so i have so much more to 16:22 look forward to in my career 16:24 and that's why i continue to train when 16:27 i moved to atlanta.
The first thing that 16:29 i did 16:29 was - i signed up for more acting classes 16:32 in atlanta.
So i really do 16:34 believe in that, when i start to look 16:36 back on 16:37, my career as a software developer, when i 16:39 was sitting in a cubicle and staring at 16:41 a computer screen 16:42.
It feels like an entire lifetime ago now.
16:46.
I would not trade this for the world 16:47.
I'Ve had so many great experiences 16:49 up until now, and i look forward to 16:52 what the future has to offer - and i know 16:55, so many of you 16:56 that are watching this - that follow my 16:57 youtube channel are trying to build your 17:00 own acting Careers - and that is the whole 17:02 goal of this acting career center 17:04 youtube channel - is to help you with that 17:06 is to help you get to where i am and 17:09, hopefully well beyond 17:10, where i am in my career, so that is it 17:13
For this video 17:15, if you liked it, please give it a thumbs 17:17 up, and if you have any questions for me, 17:19 remember to leave them down in the 17:21 comments below 17:22 until next time keep practicing keep 17:24 learning and 17:25.
I hope to see you on set one day:
