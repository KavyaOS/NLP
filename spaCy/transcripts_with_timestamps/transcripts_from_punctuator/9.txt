00:00, hello, everyone today, I'm gon na be 00:01 sharing with you how to create your very 00:03 own online course. Now. I recently shared 00:07 on Instagram that I was going to be 00:09 challenging myself to create a mini 00:11 course in just three days, and I did 00:14 accomplish that at least the rough draft 00:16 I accomplished within three days, but I 00:18 want you to know That, while this is 00:20 gon na be following that process that I 00:22 took to create this in three days, you by 00:24 no means have to create your course in 00:26 three days. The reason that I set that 00:28 really aggressive goal for myself is 00:30, because in the past I have several 00:32 courses out already and those all took 00:34 me months to create and they really 00:37 didn't need to. It was really just 00:38 because I was doubting myself and I was 00:40 overthinking things, and so that's why I 00:42 set that aggressive goal, but you 00:44 definitely should take all the time that 00:45 you need, especially if this is your very 00:46 first course, because You do obviously 00:48 want it to be a quality product 00:50. So let's happen. The first thing you're 00:55 gon na need to do is come up with a topic 00:57 for your course, and this is like the 01:00 easiest, but a hardest thing at the same 01:02 time. My best advice to you is to start 01:05 with a topic that you could talk about 01:07 all day long for free, something that you 01:11 know. If I were to say what is the thing 01:12 that you're most passionate about or 01:14 that you're most knowledgeable about or 01:15 that you're most skilled at or you know, 01:17 whatever it is that you would instantly 01:19 know what that is, and especially for me, 01:21, since I was on this time, crunch - that's 01:23. What I went to I went to kind of the 01:25 easiest thing: the thing that I'm the 01:27 most trained and the thing that I'm the 01:28 most knowledgeable about when I really 01:30 think about it, which is video. I went to 01:33 school for film and video. I have been 01:35 editing videos in either classroom 01:37, setting or professionally for over a 01:39 decade now, which is crazy to think about 01:41. That'S you know a third of my life 01:43. Essentially, another thing that you want 01:45 to think about when coming up with your 01:47 course topic. Is you know what is the 01:50 competitive landscape like? I could do a 01:53 course on a million different things, but 01:55. A lot of those things are very saturated. 01:57 right, a lot of courses, there's like a 02:00 million different courses about insert 02:02 topic here. I feel like there are video 02:04 courses out there, but there is not a lot 02:06 aimed towards business owners in the way 02:08 that I just described at least that I've 02:10 run across. So I thought that it was a 02:12 little bit less 02:12 traded but at the same time, just from 02:14 the conversations I have with my clients, 02:16 and from you guys it is something that 02:17 people want to know about. It'S also the 02:19 number one question I get asked: you know 02:21, when people hop on coaching calls with 02:22 me or you know, see me at a conference or 02:24 whatever the case they're always like. Oh 02:26, tell me about your youtube. How did you 02:27 grow your YouTube, that kind of thing and 02:29? Then? I also think it's important if you 02:30 have any kind of an existing audience. So 02:33 Instagram followers YouTube. Followers. 02:36 email lists Facebook group, whoever 02:38, wherever your community is survey them a 02:41 little bit. So I asked in my Facebook 02:43 group and he also asked on my Instagram 02:45 stories what people would prefer for 02:47. This mini-course, I gave them two options, 02:49 and also said hey. If you have you know 02:50, any other suggestions. Let me know the 02:53 next thing that I did on day, one after I 02:55 had the topic idea in mind is I came up 02:58 with a title, and this is a working title. 03:01 again, I think a lot of people get 03:03 tripped up on this and I'm honestly, like 03:05, not the best at titles, so maybe do a 03:08 little bit of external research when it 03:09 comes to naming your course. But I try to 03:13 go with something that's catchy, but 03:15, that's also searchable. You don't want to 03:18, make it like film for free Friday. 03:20. I don't know that was like a really bad 03:21 example. But, like you know something 03:23, that's super cutesy you're like LJ's, 03:25, mystery course or something that's so 03:27 bad. Oh, my gosh, something stupid like 03:29 that you want it to be searchable. You 03:31 know if people are looking for a course 03:32 about video for business. I want them to 03:34, be able to find it the research I also 03:36 determined the price point before I 03:38 start it and again this is a working 03:40 price point right. You might go back and 03:42 forth as you get into the course you 03:43 might realize. Oh my gosh, I poured a lot 03:45 of material in here. I need to up that 03:47 price, or you know. Maybe this was a lot 03:50 quicker and a lot shorter than I thought 03:51. It was gon na, be maybe I'll make it a 03:53 little bit lower. So this is just a 03:55 starting point, but I like to have the 03:57 starting point in mind when I'm creating 03:59 the course so that I'm not you know 04:01 creating a $ 5,000 course for $ 15 right 04:05. So again, that's gon na depend on a lot of 04:07 things. You'Re gon na want to do a little 04:08 bit of competitive research and see what 04:11 other courses in your niche are selling 04:13. For you may want to survey your audience 04:16. Potentially, I feel yes and know about 04:20 that when it comes to pricing because 04:21, obviously I think like. If anyone were to 04:23, ask me how much do you want to pay for 04:24, something I'm just going 04:25 five dollars right, even though I could 04:28 afford more than five dollars so take 04:29 that with a grain of salt, I think if 04:31 you're gon Na survey your audience but 04:32, you can go by data as well, so go by your 04:35 site data, see what your average 04:36 conversion on your website is see what 04:39 your conversion rate is on your website. 04:41. I do like I said. I have three other 04:44 courses and I also have a coaching 04:46 program and things like that, so I can 04:48 kind of understand where my audience is 04:50 at in terms of price point, and I've 04:52 helped thousands of people now through 04:54, my courses and Coaching programs, so I 04:56 can talk to them. I can pull aside 04:57 individual people and say hey what do 04:59. You think about this. So do some research, 05:01 unpriced price-point 05:02. I decided to make a mini course, so I 05:04 wanted to make this really affordable. 05:05 for folks, so I decided on between 05:08 fifteen and twenty five dollars and I 05:10 landed on 25 because I ended up doing 05:12. What I said in the beginning, where I was 05:13 like pouring a lot more content into it 05:16 than I had originally planned and that's 05:18. Okay, I think 25 is still super super 05:20 affordable. The other thing with pricing 05:22 is that you can always discount it right. 05:23. I can always create a coupon for ten 05:25 dollars off and make it a lot cheaper, 05:27 and then the last two things that I did 05:30 were outlined the course. So this it was 05:35 really just a brain dump on day one I 05:37 didn't want this to be like. I was typing 05:39 out word-for-word what I was gon na, say 05:41 or anything like that for an initial 05:44 outline and just go through and figure 05:46 out what you want, your modules to be and 05:48. What you want your lessons to be so 05:49 module is like a chapter essentially so 05:53. I have a module on equipment. I have a 05:55 module on pre-production on production 05:57 on post-production on promotion. These 06:01 are all modules or like chapters or 06:03 overarching themes, and then within that 06:05 I have lessons so for equipment. I have a 06:08 sample equipment list that you can shop 06:10 from. I have a tutorial on three-point 06:13 lighting. I have what else is in there. 06:16. It'S like a general lesson on what what 06:18 must-have equipment you have to have 06:20. That kind of thing, so those are all 06:22 individual lessons. I didn't write out 06:24. The content for each of those things 06:26. During this outline, I just wrote down 06:28 module 1 equipment cameras, lighting like 06:32, that kind of thing and I use Evernote to 06:34 - do this. I just create like a little 06:35 notepad or 06:36, whatever it's called a note page in 06:38 Evernote and that's what I do and then I 06:40 also came up with the look in the feel 06:43 of the course. So I went through some 06:45 different slide templates. You can use a 06:47 site like canva. You can use a site like 06:49 slides carnival to you, know, find free 06:52 slide shows, and I just like to have an 06:54 idea of the look and feel of the course 06:57 before I get too deep into it too. 06:58, because that all contributes to like the 07:00 vibe of it and what you're gon na include 07:02. I know it sounds kind of weird, but if I 07:04 have like a super business II, 07:06 professional looking course, I'm not 07:08 gon na, maybe add certain things about 07:11 memes or like whatever I might want to 07:14 include. You know what I mean 07:15, so I like to come up with those things. 07:16 all on day, one on day two. This is pretty 07:23 simple, but I went through and I created 07:25 all my slides. So once I had my slide, 07:27 show. You know template in mind. I went 07:30 through and I populated those slides and 07:31. What you'll want to do for this is, if 07:33 you've ever given a speech or like a 07:34 presentation at school or at work or 07:36. Whatever do the same thing: you're not 07:38 gon na type out every single word that 07:40 you're gon na say on to that slide. Duck 07:42 you're just going to highlight those key 07:44 points. Add in some images boom. It 07:47 shouldn't take too too long, depending on 07:49 the length of the course like I said, 07:50 mine was kind of a mini-horse. I think I 07:52 ended up with 35 slides or something 07:55 like that, which actually is a lot again. 07:57. Like I said it was more than I intended 07:59. I originally wanted it to be like 10 or 08:01 15, but anyway, and then the next thing. 08:03 that I did on day, two is actually 08:05 recorded, my direct to camera videos now 08:08. This is optional courses. Don'T 08:09 necessarily need to have a jerk to 08:12 camera videos. They don't necessarily 08:13 need to have slides. Actually, you could 08:15 do one or the other or some other you 08:17 know you could do an audio course. I'Ve 08:18 taken those before, but I like to have a 08:21 little bit of a combination between 08:22, slides and me talking to the camera just 08:25, because I think it adds a little bit of 08:28 a connection to the experience and 08:30, especially considering my course. I'M 08:32 creating, or that I created, is all about 08:34 video. I thought it made sense to 08:36, actually demonstrate some video. So I 08:39 just did a simple talking head video 08:41, which is just like me sitting and I did 08:43 it in front of a backdrop because I just 08:45 moved. If you guys are new here. I just 08:47 moved apartments, so my office is 08:49. Actually not 08:49 set up. My lighting is not set up 08:51 perfectly yeah, so I just use a backdrop 08:54, and I actually in this course that I 08:56 created, which is live and ready to 08:58 purchase now I'll leave it in the link 08:59 down below. I actually went through 09:01 exactly the equipment that I use to get 09:03 those shots how to set up the lighting 09:05 to get that shot in everything. So it's 09:08 pretty easy to do, but I set aside a day 09:10 for that, and I really would I'm 09:12 outlining my course. I guess such as back 09:14 up a little bit on day, one as I'm 09:16 outlining those courses I'm taking note 09:18 of which would which of those lessons 09:20, would be a good direct to camera video 09:23. You know some things like the lighting 09:25 video, for example. I could have made a 09:28 slide about it, but, like it's hard to 09:30, really show how to properly light a shot 09:32 without just showing it right. So I knew 09:34 that lighting was going to be a direct 09:36 to camera video slash a kind of 09:38 behind-the-scenes video, showing the 09:40 actual equipment being set up. That kind 09:42 of thing so yeah, that's all I did on day 09:43. Two I filmed and I populated the slides 09:49 then unday three I went through and 09:52 recorded, my voiceover, so recording 09:55 voiceover. Essentially what I do is I 09:57 export that slideshow into either a PDF 10:01 or a PowerPoint presentation. Whatever 10:03, you prefer and then I go through, and I 10:05 screen record the presentation and I 10:09 attach a microphone. So there's a lot of 10:11 different microphones out there that you 10:12 can purchase 10:13. I do recommend using a microphone if you 10:15. Can this microphone is not really 10:17 perfect, it kind of like picks up a lot 10:19 of background noise and like this, you 10:20 can probably hear, but it's better than 10:22 just talking into my computer or talking 10:25, even into like my camera microphone. It'S 10:27 a lot. It'S a lot better. In my opinion, 10:30 sounding so choose some kind of 10:32 microphone. There'S a million bajillion 10:33 ones out there. In my course, I do 10:35 showcase. All the microphones that I use 10:38 for voiceovers and for filming videos, 10:39 and stuff, like that too, but yeah just 10:42 - make sure that your your microphone is 10:44 attached to your screen. Recording 10:46 program. So I use as I use QuickTime you. 10:50 can also use a loom. Loom is a really 10:51 cool tool because you can show your face 10:55, while your screen recording so that's 10:56 kind of nice. If maybe you don't want to 10:58 set up for a full on direct to camera 10:59 video. But you still want to pop in and 11:01 show your face once in a while 11:03 Sonia may choose between those programs. 11:05. It doesn't matter what you choose just 11:06. Make sure that you select your 11:07 microphone when you go to screen record 11:09. So it doesn't just pick up on your 11:11 laptop or iMac or whatever audio then 11:13. What you're going to do is you're going 11:15 to export that screen, recording and 11:16 you're gon na. Add it into your video 11:19 editor. So from there you will cut out 11:22 any you know long pauses, um, x' mistakes, 11:25 bumping of your microphone bumping up 11:28, the table whatever like just clean it up 11:30 a little bit and then I export every 11:32 lesson individually. So if I do a lesson 11:35 on storyboarding, that's one video and 11:40, then I do another lesson on production. 11:43 schedules. 11:44. That'S another lesson so or another 11:46 video file. So I export all of these 11:48 individual video files and the reason 11:51 that is, is because, once you get into 11:52 your course platform, you will upload 11:55 them and you'll kind of organize them 11:57, based on modules and lessons it's a 11:59 little confusing to Explain but 12:01, hopefully I'm showing something on the 12:02 screen here. That will help you out a 12:03 little bit. I edit with Final Cut, but you 12:05 can use a program like iMovie again in 12:07. My new course I show a detailed tutorial 12:09 on iMovie cuz. It'S a really easy one to 12:11. First learn on, so that's what are you 12:14 there and then? The last thing I really 12:16 do is add it to my course platform. So 12:19 I've been using think epic for the past 12:20 few years. It'S where I launched my very 12:22 first course and I'm pretty happy with 12:23 it it's a really easy to use platform. I 12:27 mean it's a little overwhelming when you 12:28 first get in there, but once you figure 12:30 out create a new course and then, like I 12:32 said you just upload those individual 12:34 video files. You can also add other media 12:36 types, so I did some of the extra things 12:39 that I did kind of on day, four and day 12:41 five is, I created some additional PDFs. I 12:44 wanted to create like a storyboarding, 12:46 PDF, for you guys. I created an equipment 12:49 list. I created some additional, almost 12:53, like blog posts within the course that 12:55 referenced other content of mine, that 12:57 I've created over the years. It'S just 12:59 kind of like additional learning and 13:00. Then I also created summary pages at the 13:03 end of every single lesson. So I said: 13:04. Okay, ask yourself these questions before 13:07, going on to lesson six or module six or 13:11 whatever the case. So those are just 13:12 additional things. You can do like text 13:14. You can do PDFs, you can do downloads, you 13:16 can 13:16 a bunch. I think you can do audio files 13:18. There'S a lot of different things. You 13:19 can do anything cup like so yeah. It'S 13:20 really easy and they do have a free plan. 13:23. That'S pretty good. I also have, I believe, 13:25, have a referral link that I'll link down 13:27 below, if you guys want to sign up and 13:29 experience their pro plan, for I think 13:32 it's a month, so I do have that for you 13:35 guys. No, I don't think I get paid for it 13:36 or anything. I think it's just like if to 13:38 you I'm not really sure but yeah that's 13:40, pretty much all there is to it and then 13:42 from there. You really just set up your 13:44 think if ik landing page - and you know 13:46 - make it look pretty - maybe take some 13:48 photos. You know add your pricing details 13:50 in there and then from there you're 13:52 really ready to launch. So it makes it 13:54. Pretty easy for you and I really like 13:57 using that platform again, not sponsored 13:59, just what I use personally, but there's a 14:00 bajillion other ways that you could do 14:02. It there's Padilla is a really good one. 14:04. I really like their platform as well. You 14:07 can also sell a course just yourself, 14:09 like if you want to just share the file 14:11. You could do that. So there's lots of 14:13 different ways that you can do it. I'Ve 14:14 been really inspired by those of you, 14:16 guys who were a little bit inspired by 14:17. What I was doing and decided to launch 14:19 your own courses as well so really just 14:22. Continue. Tagging me if you do decide to 14:25, create a course. Definitely tag me: I want 14:28 to see what you guys are working on and 14:29 of course go ahead and sign up for my 14:31 course. It is live now, like I said, it's 14:33 25 bucks and it really teaches you how 14:35 to create DIY social. First, videos and 14:39, like I said the majority of my leads for 14:42, both my coaching business and my service 14:44 based business. My video marketing and 14:46 social media agency come from YouTube 14:48 and I do not spend a million hours per 14:51 week on YouTube. I am NOT the most 14:53 seasoned professional in the world, I 14:55 know a little bit. You know to be 14:57 dangerous, but I am not perfect at 15:00 shooting video or being on camera, so you 15:02 definitely can do it. I teach you really. 15:05. The basics of how to go ahead and get 15:06 started: shooting video getting 15:08 comfortable on camera, getting all the 15:10 right equipment things that you need so 15:12 definitely check that out. Hope you guys 15:13 like it. If you do, and with that make 15:15 sure to subscribe thumbs up the video 15:17 comment down below, and I will talk to 15:19 - you in my next one bye,
