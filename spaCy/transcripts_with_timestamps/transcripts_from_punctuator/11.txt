00:00 online courses there's no topic quite as 00:03 controversial as online courses 00:04. You know there are two types of people 00:06 in this world: there's a type of people 00:08 who criticize online courses and call 00:10 them scams and they just hate on all of 00:12. This stuff saying that it's a total 00:13 waste of time and you should never pay 00:15 for 00:15 - anything online, because all content 00:17 should be free. The internet has so much 00:19 content. Everything should just be free, 00:21 and then there's the second type of 00:23 person who pays 00:24 and gets as many online courses that 00:26 they feel are going to be relevant to 00:28, their life 00:28. And you know these people are just 00:30 buying up all the online courses that 00:31, they think are going to be useful for 00:33 them 00:33, and you know maybe they'll pick up three 00:35 to five online courses, each one, maybe 00:36 cost them a few hundred Bucks here and 00:38, there, 00:38 and they'll put in the time and effort 00:40 into learning, and let me ask you a 00:41 question who do you think 00:43 after five years is going to be rich 00:46? Who do you think is going to have the 00:48 highest chance of really getting far 00:50 ahead? 00:50, the person who's just being negative and 00:52 criticizing. All of these education, 00:54 programs and 00:55 are so hesitant to spend money to invest 00:58 in themselves. 00:58. They don't want to invest in themselves, 01:00 at all, because they think that money 01:02 should be spent for 01:03 for what consumption to buy themselves a 01:05 new car or to buy themselves tastier 01:07 food 01:08 or a playstation. Or do you think it's 01:11 going to be the person who didn't 01:12 hesitate to invest in themselves to buy 01:14 themselves books, 01:15 knowledge, information, videos, equipment, 01:17 gear or exclusive access to mentors and 01:20 coaches 01:20? Who could really give them private 01:22 information about how the world really 01:24 works and to teach them everything that 01:25? They knew 01:26 about the paths that they themselves may 01:28 want to walk in life 01:30, and you know the thing is undoubtedly 01:33. There'S going to be some scenarios where 01:34 education investments are not 01:37 necessarily going to pay off, maybe not 01:38 immediately 01:39, and so you may feel that, oh maybe there 01:41 was a waste of money there 01:43. So let me ask you, for example, when you 01:44 see somebody go to a four-year degree: 01:47. Maybe they put a hundred thousand 01:48 dollars into college. This whole college 01:50 experience in which they party and they 01:52 major in some useless degree, 01:54, or maybe it wasn't even that useless but 01:56. It was just the opportunities in the job 01:58 markets, just weren't there for them, 01:59. At the time that they came out and then 02:01 they end up with no job or maybe they're 02:03, even able to work one or two years and 02:05. Then they get laid off and 02:06. They end up as an uber driver, not using 02:09, their education at all 02:11. Would you call that a waste of money, 02:12 saying somebody having spent 02:14 a hundred thousand dollars on themselves 02:16 for very little return? 02:17 - and this happens all the time - and so i 02:20 would say that 02:21. Yes, that could be a waste of money and 02:23 generally. Investing in yourself can be a 02:25 double-edged 02:26 sword. You need to really understand 02:28 yourself, most important of all. I think 02:30. You yourself need to be willing to put 02:31 in the time, effort and commitment 02:33 and have the passion and interest in a 02:35 certain topic to really push it through 02:37, because the fact is anything you do 02:39 generally does require work. 02:41. Even running a youtube channel, it could 02:43 take 8 to 12 hours just to put together 02:45 a single 10-minute, video, sometimes 02:47, and so you have to ask yourself: are you 02:49, the type of person who's willing to put 02:51 in sit down eight hours a Day, maybe to 02:53 work on the youtube video 02:54 and, if you're not, then no matter how 02:56 much information or knowledge that you 02:58 get 02:58 you're not going to be able to become a 03:00 spectacular youtube creator from taking 03:02 a youtube course, for example, Or 03:04 similarly, learning coding data, 03:05 structures and algorithms such that you 03:07 can land a job at the top tier tech, 03:09 company like facebook or google 03:10. So that's the other program. I teach for 03:12 techinterviewpro.com 03:13. The thing about that too is you: need to 03:15, be willing to sit down and learn the 03:17 data structures and algorithms. I can 03:19 point you in the right direction: 03:20. Really coach and mentor you along the 03:22 way, tell you what you need to know what 03:23 you don't need to know all of the traps 03:25 and pitfalls that other more careless, 03:26 candidates may fall into 03:28, the first one, two three or four times 03:30, That they interview until they finally 03:32 learn how they're supposed to answer 03:33. Some of these questions and what people 03:35 are looking for 03:36, but at the end of the day, you still have 03:37 to be the person to walk that path. 03:39 - and you still have to put in the time to 03:41 study and learn and if you're, the type 03:43 of person who 03:44 doesn't really enjoy sitting down and 03:46 putting in the time and effort and work 03:48, then no matter what you try in life. You 03:50 probably won't succeed at that 03:52 right. You still have to allocate time. I 03:54 would say i don't know one two or three 03:56 hours a day 03:57 to just practice and get good at 03:59, whatever craft or passion you want to 04:00 get good at 04:02. Now, for myself i tend to be very 04:03 self-motivated and an individual 04:05 go-getter. So, for example, 04:07. I would learn japanese. All by myself. I 04:09 did my own self-study program. I tried 04:11 learning french on my own. I would learn 04:12 guitar on my own and some of these 04:14 things, 04:15 learning on your own. You know like in 04:17. Some of these adventures i actually 04:18 failed right like i was not able to 04:20 learn french or guitar very well, 04:22, and part of that is because i just lost 04:23 motivation along the way. I didn't really 04:25 know what to do, and there were no good 04:27 online programs, at least at the time. I 04:28 was learning these to really figure out 04:30. How to do these and 04:31? You know like i did not invest in myself. 04:33. In that time, and therefore 04:35, maybe because of that i did not get good 04:37. However, i do remember 04:38 one time and it took me like a year of 04:41 thinking, i actually invested in myself 04:43 and got myself a macbook pro 04:45, even though i did not need a laptop, i 04:47 had a fully functioning pc, laptop and 04:49. I had this very cheap mindset in me. It 04:52 was like 04:53. Oh, i don't want to spend money. I don't 04:54 want to spend money on anything. I only 04:56 want to spend 04:57 the cheapest amount of money possible on 04:59, the cheapest things in which i do a ton 05:01 of research and ensure that it has five 05:02 star reviews on amazon and is going to 05:04 be 05:05 absolutely a worthwhile purchase. After 05:07 hours and hours of research 05:08, but the thing is for self-investment 05:10 often your mileage may vary 05:12. Depending on who you are you often get 05:14 back? What you put in and so anyways once 05:16. I got this macbook pro 05:17. It was just sitting there and i had sunk 05:20, maybe two to three thousand dollars on 05:22, this laptop and it was just sitting 05:23 there 05:24, this nice beautiful piece of hardware 05:26, and at that point it would have been a 05:27 complete waste of 05:28 Money time effort to have purchased this 05:31 piece of equipment 05:32, but what i did after that was, i started 05:34 to put in additional time and effort 05:36 into learning ios development. I taught 05:38 myself objective c, going through a few 05:40 tutorials. I had to buy a few books for 05:41 that as well and 05:42, i learned a bunch of random useless 05:44 things along the way too, because i had 05:46 no mentor at the time 05:47. And so i even learned swift, for example, 05:49 and swift was totally useless for what i 05:51 wanted to try to accomplish, and so i 05:53 would go around running in circles and 05:55. I think this is where, for example, a 05:56 mentor could help save you. Some time but 05:58, eventually, i was able to launch a number 06:00 of apps and games onto the app store 06:02 and from that path. I was eventually 06:04 hired into google as a 06:06 ios software engineer and from there 06:08. Well. The rest is kind of history: it put 06:10 my life on just 06:11 ever so slightly a little different 06:13 trajectory a different course just a 06:15 little bit upwards, 06:16 and over time, as i continue to build 06:18 upon that walk that path over the years. 06:20 - and i continue to invest in myself like 06:22, for example, i would take negotiation 06:24 classes at google leadership classes 06:26. I think that that helped me with my 06:27 communication skills, my teamwork skills 06:29, my ability to lead and overall achieve 06:32 more and it helped me get into 06:33 further higher positions in my tech, 06:35 career, and so i think part of the issue 06:37. Is that online courses and really 06:39 education in general 06:41 has returns that can vary from anywhere 06:43 from zero returns 06:44 to millions in returns, right like it can 06:47 set you on a totally different path and 06:49 really help you achieve success and it 06:51 Really just depends on the person and 06:53 how you apply that skill 06:55, the knowledge that you learn and having 06:57 around online courses for about two 06:58 years now. I'Ve met so many different 07:00 types of people, but there's two types of 07:02 people. I want to highlight, for you the 07:03 first type is the type who 07:04 i've already mentioned. They never seem 07:06 to want to invest in themselves, 07:08. Well, of course, they have no problem 07:10 buying the latest iphone 07:11. They have no problem buying the latest 07:13 sneakers or buying some really expensive, 07:15 dinner at some 07:16 restaurant steaks wine. The latest 07:17 sterile speakers fashion 07:19 drugs they'll even spend tens of 07:21 thousands hundreds of thousands of 07:22 dollars on their own education on their 07:24 colleges, 07:25, and yet they won't go the extra little 07:27 distance to put some of their own money 07:29 and Invest in themselves, 07:30, they're, okay, if their parents pay for 07:31 their college basically, but for them to 07:33, invest in their own futures 07:35. Well, that would require them to be 07:37, accountable and responsible and to 07:39 really believe in themselves. To really 07:40 want to help themselves, and you know 07:42 people cannot help you if you're not 07:44 willing to help yourself like 07:45. Let'S pretend you're at the beginning of 07:47, a marathon and the person says well, you 07:49 have to pay an entry fee for this 07:50 marathon. It'S going to be this 100 hour, 07:52 marathon, 07:52, and then you've got people who are 07:54 saying they don't even want to pay the 07:55 entrance fee. Well, 07:56: there's going to be countless hours of 07:57 time, training and effort that has to 07:59 come in. After that, as well and if you're 08:01 not even willing to pay the entrance fee 08:03, then you have to ask yourself 08:04. What are you really trying to do here? 08:06? What are you trying to accomplish 08:07? Maybe it's time that you up your game or 08:09 to get serious about what you're trying 08:10 to do in life 08:12 and then the second type of person i've 08:14 encountered is the type of person who 08:16. Maybe they have all of their intentions. 08:18. In the right place, they want to work 08:19 hard 08:20, but the program is just not really at 08:21, their level. You know there are some 08:23 people who come in and they're super 08:24 experienced, 08:25 super senior and so they'll go through 08:27. The courses and the programs and they'll 08:28 say 08:29. They already knew everything they got it 08:30, and you know some of these people they 08:32 may just be 08:32 very experienced overleveled. Maybe they 08:35 even know more than me, although 08:36, it's not quite likely, but in that 08:38 scenario i would say that the program's 08:39 not going to be very helpful for them 08:41 and then there's the other opposite 08:42 spectrum of this, where you have some 08:44 people who they're too 08:46 basic or they're, not at the prerequisite 08:48 level that you're expecting to teach at 08:50. For example. Maybe you have people who 08:51 they're, not very computer 08:52 tech savvy at all. They don't know how to 08:54 use a keyboard or a mouse really, 08:56 and so anyways. This is one reason why, at 08:58 least for me for all of the programs i 08:59 run, i offer a full 14-day. Money-Back 09:02 satisfaction guarantee if, for any reason, 09:04 the person is not happy and that's 09:06, simply because 09:07 there's so many different types of 09:08 people on the internet right once you 09:10 put a program, or course online 09:12. Anybody can access that and there's 09:13 going to be some people who are just not 09:15 going to be fit for the course and 09:17 generally for all of the programs. I run 09:18. I like to build online learning 09:20 communities around them. Private 09:22 exclusive facebook groups, where students 09:24 can get together 09:25 study together, share information topics 09:27 and learn together, and so it doesn't 09:29 make much sense to have. People enter the 09:30 community who 09:31 maybe think the course was too advanced, 09:33 for them or too basic for them or for 09:35. Whatever reason 09:36 is dissatisfied, i do view it as a 09:38 win-win situation to offer a flexible 09:40 for refund policy. 09:41. Now, overall, i did want to say that 09:43, probably just a few years ago, i was in 09:45 this really cheap mentality 09:47, where i just i never wanted to spend 09:48 money. I never wanted to invest in myself. 09:50. I just wanted everything to be free. 09:52 and then lately i've also been seeing 09:54 some people who they just go out there 09:56 and they buy every online course that 09:58, they think is going to be useful, 09:59 and sure, sometimes maybe occasionally 10:01 they're going to waste some money. Maybe 10:03 they're not going to get 100 value out 10:04 of the course. Maybe they'll only get 10:06 50 value, maybe 30 value, but even at that 10:09 point, maybe they would have learned 10:11, something and 10:12. I began thinking in my mind, yeah 10:15 good for them good for them, like they're, 10:16, really trying to improve themselves and 10:18. You know what overall they'll probably 10:20, be on a higher path 10:22 than me after a few years right, they're 10:24 setting themselves up for a different 10:25 trajectory 10:26, and i wouldn't be surprised to see that 10:28 payoff for them and there's 10:29 sort of this Crabs in the bucket type of 10:31 mentality, where crabs try to pull each 10:33 other down whenever one crab tries to 10:35 escape and get a little bit higher out 10:37, and i don't want to beat that crap 10:38. That'S just pulling everybody else down 10:40 like if they want to try to make a go at 10:42, it 10:42 escape the rat race. Elevate themselves, 10:44 set themselves up on a totally different 10:46 trajectory that over the years 10:47 may just pay off for themselves. I just 10:50 find myself kind of 10:51 envying that type of hustle that 10:52 productivity 10:54. Now, overall, though, i do recommend, when 10:55, you purchase anything to check out their 10:57 return policy, make sure that you can 10:59 return something get a refund if, for any 11:01 reason, you're not happy with whatever 11:02 they're providing 11:03 and there's also credit card disputes. So 11:06 anytime, you charge something to credit 11:07 card. If you feel that it wasn't right or 11:09 proper. You can oftentimes ask your 11:11 credit card company to investigate that 11:12 to challenge the charge 11:14 and they can help you investigate that 11:16 and reverse the charge as well. 11:18. So they'll do for me, but let me know 11:19. What are your thoughts on online 11:20 programs or courses? Have you taken any 11:22 that you really recommend? For me? I know 11:24. I took the jump cut 11:25 series, which was really pretty good 11:27. Actually, but let me know in the comments 11:28 below i'll, see you there if you liked 11:29, the video please give it a like and 11:31 subscribe, appreciate that and i'll see 11:32 you in the next one thanks bye,
