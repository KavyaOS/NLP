00:00 [ Music, ], 00:01 you're, so sweet 00:03. I love you just the fact that 00:06, i'm literally sitting down and making 00:08 this video 00:10 and i have what i have to share it blows 00:12. My mind 00:13. I am just completely blown away 00:16, so so grateful still could not believe 00:18. What just happened last week 00:20. So if you're not aware, if you don't 00:21 follow me on instagram, i 00:23 launched my new course: the business 00:25 confident photographer 00:26. So this is really my flagship, signature 00:29 course on how to grow a photography, 00:31 business from start to finish 00:32. Everything that i wish that i knew when 00:34. I started - and i know this channel at 00:36. This point has shifted a lot from 00:37 photography and i focus a lot more on 00:39, just like instagram marketing all of 00:41 that fun stuff 00:42. But i know a lot of you are still 00:43 photographers and a lot of you do follow 00:45 me on instagram 00:46. I am just like shocked, like completely 00:49 shocked, 00:50 and shocked that i was able to grow this 00:54 and like even in the midst of a pandemic 00:57. Even in the midst of everything 00:58 happening this year, that's been crazy. 01:00, like i am so stinking 01:03 grateful, and so i really wanted this 01:06 video 01:07 to really be really break down. Like more 01:10 of my analytics 01:12 breakdown, how the launch went break down 01:14, my strategy going into it 01:16 and break down exactly how many hours i 01:19 had to pour into creating this 01:20 online and what a lot of people would 01:22 say: passive income. 01:24 course really was because it's a lot 01:26 more than you might think 01:28, and i really just want to share with you 01:30 too, how 01:31 you know it might sound like a lot to 01:32 make in 10 days, but really the reality. 01:35 of launching stuff like this is your 01:37 sales go down to almost nothing and then 01:39. You go way 01:40 up and then you go back down and i am 01:43 still building out 01:44 um evergreen income and how to make ink 01:47 passive income 01:48. From different things like my course so 01:51 that it's not as much of a flat line 01:53, but i am just i mean still just it's 01:57 - it's crazy that the course is out there 01:59 and i'm really 01:59 able to do that with the course now And 02:02, to even have like even i had a couple 02:04 more students enroll this week, 02:05 after the launch, sale end, and so it's 02:08 just been super exciting 02:09, and i truly like am so stinking grateful 02:13, and so i really just wanted to share 02:14 with you a big recap: 02:16, really like a launch a week report of 02:19 how the entire launch went because i 02:20 know you guys enjoy these videos. You'Ve 02:22 enjoyed some of my past ones that i've 02:23 done, and so i just really wanted to 02:24 break it down for you 02:26, and how the launch week went for the 02:28 business, confident photographer 02:29 and leading up to it and all that fun. 02:31. Stuff, so first - and this is kind of what 02:33 i already mentioned, but to clarify - i do 02:35 want to make sure that you guys 02:36 understand like 02:37 when we say passive income, even in this 02:39 video or even in my any of my other 02:41 Videos 02:42 to me, passive income is really just 02:44 scalable income 02:45. So you know for, for example, with 02:47 photography, it's hard to really scale 02:49, that unless you have associates or 02:50 something like that, because there's only 02:51 one of you 02:52 and it's not bad at all, like i and i 02:55 still think, like being a Photographer is 02:56 awesome like, and i know a lot of people 02:58 suit like enjoy that so so much, but i 03:00 know something for me. My business that 03:02 i've always had the vision to do 03:04 is to grow it into something scalable, 03:06, something that you know. I don't have to 03:08 work a certain number of hours 03:09 in order to make a certain amount of 03:12 money every year, 03:13, and so with photography. It'S really hard 03:16 to 03:16. Do that and to have yeah that in place 03:19 but 03:20, when it's something like a course, i 03:22 wouldn't say it's necessarily less work 03:24, but you can put in the same amount of 03:26 work and start making more and more and 03:28 more 03:28 money. As the time goes on - and so i just 03:31 really wanted to clarify that first, like 03:33, when i say passive income 03:35, when we talk about passive income with 03:36 courses or anything like that, i really 03:38 think something. We need to 03:39. Make sure that we're distinguishing is 03:41, that it's really just scalable income 03:43 and it's not necessarily always going to 03:44 be passive, because even after launching 03:46 the course like 03:46. I still want to pour so much into the 03:48 students in making course updates being 03:50 uh active in the facebook group doing 03:52. Some live interviews with guest experts 03:54 in the facebook group. So it's not like 03:56. You know i create this course 03:57 and it's one and done which you could do 04:00, but you're not going to be a successful 04:01 course creator. If you do that, because 04:03, your students are going to realize 04:04 you're, just creating these courses and 04:05, then ditching them 04:07 [, Music, ] 04:12. So let's talk a little bit about my 04:14 strategy. What was my strategy going into 04:16? The launch 04:17? What do i think made it successful 04:18 leading up like what i did leading up to 04:20 it because 04:21, if you know anything about launching 04:22 courses online products 04:24 launching anything basically, one of the 04:27 biggest things is creating 04:28 almost hype and creating it's Really 04:30 just priming your audience. So what are 04:31 you doing 04:32 in the weeks really the month leading up 04:34 to the course launch, but 04:35, even in the months uh monsta 04:39, leading up to the launch like what are 04:41 you doing to get. People excited about 04:43, the course to get them to want to buy as 04:45 soon as the course releases 04:46, and so the first thing that i was doing 04:48 is, i shared a lot of behind the scenes 04:50 of myself creating the course 04:51 and i Think that was just really easy, 04:53 content, because i was already doing it. I 04:55 just had to take some behind the scenes: 04:56 like videos and boomerangs and stuff 04:57 like that to post on instagram 04:59, and so i would take some 05:02 behind the scenes of myself, like 05:04, outlining the course creating the slides 05:05 for the course Filming the course 05:07 um uploading course. Videos uploading 05:10 bonus lessons. Like all of that fun stuff 05:12. I was able to create behind the scenes 05:13 and share about it that way. On my 05:15 instagram 05:15. Another thing that i think was super 05:17 strategic going into the course and even 05:19, going into creating the course 05:20 is making sure that i was pulling my 05:22 audience. This is 05:24 very, very important and something that i 05:26 think if you want to create any sort of 05:28 like online product 05:29 digital product, something that's very 05:31, very important, because there's so many 05:33 digital products and courses nowadays, 05:35. Something that's very important is 05:36, making sure that what you want to create 05:39 is actually what people want to buy 05:41, and sometimes you also need to sell to 05:44 what they want 05:45, not to what they need, and you sell them 05:48 what they want. 05:49 right, but then you also give them what 05:50 they need inside the course on that 05:52 particular topic, so, okay, let's start 05:54 from the beginning. So when it comes to 05:55 picking a topic 05:56 make sure that your audience actually 05:57 wants it from you. Make sure it's 05:59 something that they're actually 06:00 interested in 06:01, because it you know, if you think it's a 06:02 good idea, but no one that follows. You 06:04 thinks it's a good idea and wants to buy 06:06 from it 06:07. It doesn't. Do you any good, it's a really 06:08 easy way you can do. This is to pull your 06:10 audience. Maybe on like three 06:12 ideas that you have for things, you want 06:14 to offer, one of them being the thing you 06:15 actually are thinking. You want to launch 06:17, but then the other two are other ideas: 06:18, that you've been potentially interested 06:20 in or leave it up for anyone to tell you 06:21 what they want to learn from you, 06:23, and i had so many people so about a year. 06:26 ago i actually put on my instagram and 06:28 said: hey like i have this idea for a 06:30 course or something along these lines: 06:31, maybe a workshop 06:32, which, with 2020, i was like i kind of 06:34 ditched the workshop idea because 06:36, you know Um, but i literally 06:39 pulled my audience a year ago and i 06:41 asked them like what do you guys want to 06:44 learn from me like i have this vision 06:46 for this course. That'S more 06:47 all-inclusive like 06:48, how, basically, how to book more clients? 06:50 and maintain a healthy business, 06:52 sustainable business 06:53 and the response was overwhelming. I had 06:55, so many responses from you guys saying 06:57 like this is exactly what i want. This is 06:58 what i need 06:59, and that was really reaffirming to me. 07:01, like okay, like i have this idea and 07:02 other people, think it's a good idea, 07:04. On top of that, when it came to actually 07:07 creating the course and marketing the 07:09 course 07:09. I also sent out another feedback survey 07:12 to my audience, asking them 07:14. What are the biggest things they're 07:15 struggling with when it comes to running 07:16, a photography business 07:18, and that was one of the main questions. 07:19. We asked. We also asked a lot of 07:20 different questions. My copywriter was 07:21 helping me with this 07:22 and it was really eye-opening to see 07:24 like the way that 07:26, the way things people struggled with 07:27, like they're things that i wouldn't have 07:29 thought of, because maybe i never 07:30 struggled with it. But there's a lot of 07:32 people who do struggle with it 07:33, and i was able to use that in a lot of 07:35. You know not only the way i created the 07:36 course, but also in the way that i 07:38 crafted my marketing and my messaging 07:40 around selling the course again selling 07:41 them what they 07:42 want and then give them what they need. 07:44 inside the course. Another thing that i 07:46 did that was very strategic and the way 07:48 that i launched the course 07:49 is. I had beta testers and i actually had 07:51 11 beta testers, which might sound like a 07:53 lot 07:53. If you've done courses before you know 07:55. Anything about them, but for me, 07:57 personally, 07:58. The social proof guys like social proof, 08:00 is gold 08:01, like it doesn't matter. If i am telling 08:03 people over and over again 08:05, that my course is awesome and they 08:06 should buy it. But if someone else 08:08 and let alone like several people, are 08:10 saying how awesome the course is, the 08:12 results they've seen from it 08:13. That is worth way more than any 08:15 beautiful sales page. You could put 08:16 together 08:17, and so that's why i decided to have 08:18 plenty of beta testers. So i could pull 08:20 different testimonials from 08:21, have people in different stages of their 08:23 business and that honestly helped so so 08:25 much in launching the course and i'm so 08:27 grateful for all those beta testers who 08:29 gave me their time not only go Through 08:31, the course, but also give you the 08:32 feedback 08:33, you know to help me improve the course 08:34 and also give me those that social proof 08:36. Those testimonials those reviews that i 08:38 could share on the sales page sharing my 08:40 social media 08:41. Literally anywhere - and i could use that 08:43 in so many different ways - the last thing 08:44 i want to mention here is that 08:46. I chose for priming my audience so 08:48 getting them to think. I mean 08:49 for me because it was such a big horse. 08:51 and because i already had so many 08:52 photographers following me and love my 08:53 content like 08:54, i don't think i had to do very much like 08:56 specific priming for the course, but i 08:58 did strategically create some blog posts 09:00, leading up to the Course, 09:01 that were helping to prime them for my 09:03 course and get them thinking of me as 09:05, the photography business expert right so 09:07 i'll put some 09:08 examples here of some of the blog posts. 09:09 that i wrote and 09:11. It was just super helpful for me to be 09:14 able to share those blog posts on 09:15. You know link it on my instagram and 09:17. Also, you know take snippets of those 09:19 blog posts share and instagram captions 09:21, so leading up to the launch. I look for 09:23, this, like three four weeks before my 09:25 launch date. 09:26. I was sharing those kind of posts over 09:27 and over again to get people thinking of 09:29 me 09:29. As someone who is the go-to person for 09:31 being a photography 09:33 business person that they should learn 09:35 from this is 09:36 even more important if you're doing 09:37, something very specific like when i 09:38 launched a course on wedding details. 09:40. I needed people to think of me as the 09:42 go-to details, expert 09:44, and so i was doing even more priming 09:45 than i did with this course, because this 09:46 course is so inclusive. I didn't do 09:48 as much, but with most courses like you, 09:51. Definitely 09:52 have to do so much priming to get people 09:54. To think of you as the expert in that 09:56 topic. 10:02. All right! So now we're going to shift 10:03 gears a little bit into talking about 10:05 launch week and when i say launch week, i 10:07 am talking about 10:08 thursday. Let me find the date real, quick. 10:11. I don't have the date pulled up 10:12 um, okay. So when we talk about launch 10:15 week, we're talking 10:16 thursday november 12th through friday, 10:18 november 20th, 10:20 and really i'm going to also include 10:21 saturday november 21st, because i didn't 10:23 have a chance to take down the sale 10:24. And i had a few more sales that day so 10:26. Those are the days that we're really 10:28 talking about, and we say 10:29 launch week because my webinar was 10:31 hosted 10:32 on thursday november 12th. I hosted two 10:35 times 10:35 time slots for my webinar, and that was 10:37, where people could watch the webinar and 10:39 get a free class for me for about 30 10:41 minutes 10:41, and then they were pitched my course for 10:42 about 20 minutes, and then They had 10:45 15 minutes of q, a at the very end 10:46 afterwards. So that's 10:48. The first time like someone could join 10:49 the course - and it was an early access - 10:51 sale, so they were able to get their 10:52 hands on it 10:53 before anyone else could before anyone 10:55 else publicly could before was even 10:57 launched my email list or Anything like 10:58 that so 10:59, that's how i chose to launch the course 11:00 and i had never done a webinar before 11:02. The last time i launched a course, i did 11:04 a week-long challenge, so it was really 11:06 cool to me to do that and i actually 11:07 really enjoyed it. I think even more than 11:09 i 11:09 expected to. I think i enjoyed it even 11:11. More than the challenge, because one 11:12 it felt like was less work for me. It 11:15 felt like less work, for me to 11:17, have to show up every day. I wanted to 11:19 show up for one day and do a webinar 11:20, but it did feel like a lot more pressure 11:22, because there's only one day 11:24 and you have to get it right or that's 11:26, the end of it at least that's how i 11:27 think of it - and i probably shouldn't 11:29 think of it that way. But you know i do a 11:31 little bit and 11:32 all right, so how many people actually 11:34 signed up for the webinar, so i ended up 11:35 having 729 11:38 registrants, and that includes both times 11:40. I had more in the 12, 11:42 p.m. Slot and less than the 6 p.m and 11:44 more that showed up. 11:45, live like this percentage that showed up 11:47 live was to my 12 p.m, webinar time slot 11:49, which was interesting because when i 11:50 pulled my audience and asked what time 11:52 would work best for them for this class 11:54, a lot of them said 6 P.M: eastern 11:56 standard time, but then more showed up at 11:57, 12 p.m, eastern standard time so 11:59. I thought that was interesting. I don't 12:00 know if it's just because it was the 12:01 first time or something like that. 12:03. My show upgrade for both webinars 12:04 combined was 38.27 12:07, which means that i had 279 people that 12:09 end up showing up live to either the 12 12:11 p.m or 6 p.m, 12:12 slot and then out of the replay 12:15 attendees um 12:16. Some people who didn't show up but watch 12:18, the replay. Instead there was a 26.75 12:21 show up rate, and that means 195. People 12:24 watched the replay 12:25 and it was just super like it went super 12:28. Well, i was super happy with how 12:30 the webinar went, how many people 12:32 registered so 12:34 after they signed up for the webinar 12:35. They would also get a few emails leading 12:38 up to when the early access sale ended 12:40 on saturday evening 12:41, and i think at that point i had 12:44 about 20 to 22 people sign up from the 12:48 time. You know either right away at the 12:49 webinar 12:50 or within the few days of the webinar 12:52, and then, when i launched on monday, i 12:54 know i had a handful more 12:56 sign up on monday. I should have these 12:58 exact stats. I don't have them on me, i'm 13:00, sorry, but 13:00. I had a few more people sign up monday 13:02 and i remember tuesday, wednesday 13:04 thursday was 13:04 really slow. I had maybe one maybe two 13:07 people sign up 13:08 and then a huge surge of people on 13:10 friday and then 13:11 saturday. So the sale officially ended 13:13 friday at midnight eastern standard time 13:16. But i did leave it obens at a wedding to 13:18 shoot on saturday, and i told i 13:20 secretly sneakily posted on my instagram 13:22 and i wasn't planning on doing this but 13:24. I showed on my instagram, like i didn't 13:25, have time to take it down before i left 13:26, my wedding this morning 13:27. So if you still want it like here's, your 13:30 sign to grab it, and i had like three or 13:31 four more people sign up. So the majority 13:33 of people signed up either with the 13:34 webinar 13:35 either like live during the webinar or 13:37. During the early access sale 13:39 that ended on saturday or they signed up 13:41 on the first day, 13:43 of the public sale on monday or the last 13:45 day of the public sale on monday 13:46, and that's really interesting too. 13:47. Because that's what i've really seen 13:49, statistically with my shop sales or my 13:51 shop launch like 13:52, i have the most sales on monday, the 13:54 first day when it opens, and then friday 13:55, the last day that the sale closes 13:57. Okay, my bun came out, and then i was 14:00 trying to look up certain stats, but i 14:01 couldn't find them on hand 14:03, so we're just gon na roll with the rest 14:04 of this okay. So the last thing i want to 14:06 mention here 14:07 is that i did run facebook ads. So i 14:10 recently started working with a facebook, 14:11 ads company 14:12 to help me with facebook ads for 14:13 different parts of my business and they 14:15 did help me get some webinar 14:16 registrations. That'S why i was trying to 14:18 look up the exact like 14:19 number, but for some reason the stats 14:21 aren't pulling up and i don't have it on 14:22 hand. So i want to say it was around. Like 14:25 100 to 150, we got from facebook ads 14:29 uh that were like a cold audience. That 14:30, like didn't, really know me and then the 14:32 rest of them was for my organic audience. 14:34, via, like my email list, 14:35 instagram, my facebook group stuff, like 14:37, that so um 14:38. Yes, i would say the majority of this 14:40, like webinar and majority of this 14:42 launch, was pretty organic in the sense 14:44. That 14:45, i don't know um. I don't have a lot of 14:48 people who bought that 14:49 were completely cold, but because we did 14:52 do some ads to 14:53 a cold audience. We also retargeted my 14:55 audience because i found that to work 14:56 really well, 14:57 for sales and launches in the past. We 14:59 were doing a combination of both so 15:01. It can't be hard to say like what 15:03 exactly was 100 15:04 from facebook ads versus from the from 15:07. My organic audience, but i did spend 15:09. My ad spend, for you know, webinar 15:12 registrations, plus the week of the 15:13 launch was about fifteen hundred dollars 15:16, but i know that i saw a good return on 15:18, my investment for that 15:19 [, Music, ], 15:25, okay, so first i want to dive Into how 15:27 much i made exactly that week and this 15:29 is just from 15:30 either my course and order bumps so 15:33. That'S a whole nother thing that i 15:35 literally did not even mention, but i'll 15:36 dive into a little bit in a second 15:38, and also how many hours i spent directly 15:41 on the course not even including, like 15:43, just other ways of growing. My audience. 15:45 time spent doing that in order to have a 15:46 successful launch so 15:48. The final number, how much i made from 15:51, this 15:51 launch and on like the numbers higher uh 15:54, if you include 15:55 shop sales from like other products, that 15:57 maybe came from other from course, 15:58 members or whatever but 16:00. I made 24 895 16:03 generated so when we say generated that 16:05 means that that number 16:06 that not that total number actually hit 16:08. My bank account because i offered a 16:10 payment plan about half of the students. 16:12 opted for the payment plan, so they only 16:14 paid 97 16:15 to get in and then they're gon na make 16:17 payments for the next five months in 16:18 order to keep access to the content and 16:20. So the amount that actually 16:22 hit. My bank account within the week of 16:24. The launch is 14 16:26 225 and then the rest is coming in the 16:29 next 16:30, five months with that payment plan so 16:32, and with that too, this is just one 16:34 source of income, which is crazy. 16:36. To me like, if you include, like other 16:38 orders, i had in my shop that week just 16:40 because of all the promotion, if you 16:42 include affiliate income like it's even 16:43, more, which is 16:44, it just kind of blows my mind and then 16:46. How many hours i spent 16:48 directly on the business confident 16:49 photographer, so i use toggle to track my 16:51 hours to track my work. If you don't do 16:53, that 16:53 highly recommend, it is incredible, but i 16:56 literally spent 16:58 164 hours directly on this course 17:01, like literally things that are related 17:03 to either the course creating the course 17:05. The outline the webinar 17:06 the launch week etc. Like anything, that's 17:09, i can directly pull it back to this 17:12 course was 164 hours, which is equivalent 17:14 to 17:15 21 hour work days. If you 17:19 were to do all at once, but this really 17:22 was spread out over 17:23, mainly three. Almost four months, because 17:26, i wasn't working on these things all at 17:27 once because i know for me my brain 17:29 power. 17:29. I can't do eight hours of this kind of 17:31 work like it is 17:32 deep, deep work where i need to be 17:34. Focused and really really 17:36 like honing in on what i'm doing - and i 17:38 only have maybe like three hours of that 17:40 kind of work in a day, 17:41 and so yeah. This is spread out over a 17:44 few months 17:44, and this is not including any time i was 17:46 also spending answering 17:48 emails, putting up content to be priming 17:51 and putting up 17:52 like uh, creating content on instagram to 17:55 be growing. My audience like things like 17:56, that, like there's still more work, that 17:58 went into this than just these hours, but 18:00. These are ones. I could directly relate 18:01 back 18:02 to my launch and the course and all of 18:04 that stuff 18:10. Now i want to chat with you guys about 18:11 my plans to really create this 18:13 into passive aka scalable income going 18:16 back to what we talked about in the 18:17 beginning 18:18, and so i really just wanted to share 18:19 with you how i'm planning To do that in 18:21, the upcoming months 18:22, how i'm planning to make this more 18:23 passive income for my business 18:25 and so yeah, i'm gon na be honest and say: 18:28. I don't have all the answers. I don't 18:30 know everything. Yet i don't know exactly 18:32 how this is going to play out 18:34, but it does make me very excited because 18:36 this course is not only something that 18:38 just teaches people something, but it's a 18:39 whole 18:40 transformation that changes their entire 18:42 life and The way they look at their 18:43 business 18:44, which is so exciting for me, and it hit 18:45 such a big pain point that a lot of know 18:47, a lot of photographers face 18:49, and so it really is just so exciting for 18:52 me to think About that, so the first way 18:54 that i'm planning to 18:55 put this on passive aka, scalable and 18:58 start making money off of this 18:59 off of all of that work that i've 19:01 already done. Besides, just the launch 19:03 week, 19:04 is one i'm gon na re-release the webinar 19:06, so people can watch it on replay 19:08 whenever they want to 19:09, and so people are able to go back and 19:11 watch this webinar 19:12 and then be pitched the course. Um after 19:14, they watch this free class 19:16 that converted so well. For me, i know my 19:18 conversion rate directly to the webinar 19:20. I think it was close to like five-ish 19:22 percent 19:24 for the people that signed up versus the 19:25 people who bought, and so for me 19:27, especially for this course being at a 19:29 higher price point, around 500 19:31. That is awesome like that is so so 19:33 awesome that i'm able to see that kind, 19:35 of return 19:36, and so i'm really interested to see that 19:38 with doing that 19:40. How what my conversion rate is for the 19:42 replay, 19:43 and yeah, we'll just see we'll see what 19:44 happens, i'm planning to first start with 19:47. It organically so put it out there. I 19:48 have a waitlist going for 19:50, this free webinar, and so i have um 19:52 people 19:53 already sign up and wanting to watch the 19:55 replay once it comes out 19:56 and then continuing to share about it. To 19:58. Add people to that get the tr 20:00, our views that are already coming to my 20:01 website and um turning them into people 20:03, who sign up for the class 20:05 and potentially want to join the course 20:06. So with that said, that means that 20:08 they're going to get that 20:09 launch sale again if they watch the 20:11 webinar through 20:12. So that's the only way, they're going to 20:13 be able to get it and then potentially 20:14 be put into a sales 20:16. Funnel so that they can be pitched to it 20:18 again via 20:19 email and have a couple of days to think 20:21 about it and also jump in on the sale. 20:22. Then 20:23. If all of that goes well and it's 20:24 working well organically, i then want to 20:26 flip that and then turn it into 20:28 running on facebook, ads to my free 20:31 webinar for people to sign up and then 20:32 potentially become 20:33 buyers of my course. Another way that i 20:35 want to 20:36 start making passive income, where it 20:38 truly will feel more 20:39 passive, more scalable than all the hours 20:42 of work that i put into this course 20:44 is to run sales on it two to three times 20:46 a Year so 20:47, going back to that um sale, price and 20:50 really um 20:50, pushing that course when i do shop, sale, 20:53, so 20:54, i'm still figuring out like how i want 20:55 to do this. I really want to have like 20:57, a set yearly sale. So people can know 21:00 what to expect 21:01, so i'm still trying to figure out what 21:02 that looks like for me. I know i want to 21:04 do black friday next year. I'M not really 21:05 doing a big black friday sale this year 21:07, but i know i want to do that and then i 21:08 want to do at least two other sales 21:10 during the years. I don't know if that 21:10 means like 21:11, maybe a beginning of the year, sale and 21:13, then maybe a birthday sale, because my 21:14 birthday is in may or maybe 21:16 a christmas and july sale like i'm still 21:18, not exactly sure 21:19. How it's going to look, but i know at 21:21 least two three two to three times per 21:22 year. I am going to be putting this 21:23 course 21:24 on sale so that we can continually be 21:26 adding new members during that sale. 21:28, especially people 21:29, who have joined my audience since the 21:30 last sale, 21:36. Okay. So what exactly would i do 21:39 differently? If i was going back and 21:41 redoing this course is there anything i 21:42 would do differently. 21:43. The answer is yes. Definitely, the first 21:45 thing is i for my next course. I think 21:47. This worked really well for this course 21:49. Like filming and editing it all by 21:50, myself 21:51, which i did a vlog on that, if you're 21:53 interested i'll put a link in the 21:54 description and go check it out here but 21:56, i did a vlog all about how i filmed my 21:58 own Course, 21:59, and while i absolutely loved it for this 22:01 course - and it worked really well for me - 22:03 - i think in the future. I would definitely 22:05 want to 22:06 either hire a videographer to do it or 22:08 hire someone to at least go back and 22:10 edit, the videos for me, so i'm actually 22:12 filming them, because i am so used to 22:14 filming videos by myself. Like i 22:15 enjoy it, but i would want someone to 22:18 help me with the editing aspect of it so 22:20, i'm not having to do all of that stuff. 22:21. On my own 22:22. The next course that i create too, if i 22:24 do create another. Like horse, like this 22:26, i think i'm going to create something 22:28 that maybe is a little bit more scaled 22:30 down and not as like all-inclusive so 22:33. I would probably pick more specific, more 22:35 of a specific topic to cover instead of 22:37 having 22:37. This huge long course and what i 22:39 probably would do next time i would 22:40 probably create something: a little 22:42 smaller, more concise. I think it worked 22:43 really well for this course 22:44 and don't get me wrong, like i think it 22:45 was so needed to have, of course, this big 22:47, but it's gon na be a while, i think, before 22:49. I want to create something. This big 22:50 again because 22:51, it was a little crazy. The next thing 22:53, that i think i'll do differently - is i'll 22:55 start handing more things and more tasks, 22:57 off to my virtual assistant 22:58, to do like in the weeks leading up to 23:00 the launch, so my thought was 23:02. I thought i would need her more like 23:04 during the actual launch week, but then i 23:06 realized once i got to the launch week, 23:08 that 23:08 at that point everything had to be done 23:10, and so i think i would probably like 23:12 ask for More help when it comes to 23:15 things leading up to the launch and i 23:16 definitely could have 23:18, but for some reason i got in this 23:19 mindset of just doing all these things: 23:21, myself and 23:22. So it's really just my mindset. I really 23:23 need to break that so 23:25 for my next launch course. I know that i 23:28 need to 23:28, be handing certain things off leading up 23:30 to the launch and not just waiting until 23:32 launch week to be asking for help 23:39. All right in the strap of this video 23:41 we're going to talk about some of the 23:42 things that i 23:42 am super super proud of with this launch 23:45 and the first one 23:46, obviously making almost 25 000 in 10 23:49 days. Like that's crazy to me, 23:51 and just completely blows my mind 23:52, because i it makes me so so grateful 23:54, like is, i know, 23:56 behind every single person that invested 23:58 in this course 23:59 is a true truly like a human being whose 24:02 life Is going to be completely 24:03 transformed by what they learn and that 24:06 is what i'm excited about 24:07, so that just blows my mind, something i'm 24:09. Definitely super super proud of with my 24:11 course 24:12. It'S a something that i'm also very 24:13, proud of. With this course 24:15 is that it is so like start to finish 24:17 for photographers and helping them grow 24:19, like an actual sustainable business 24:22, because i think there needs to be more 24:23 education out there like it, and that 24:25 makes me really excited that. It'S out in 24:26, the world and that people can start 24:28 going through it and that students are 24:29 already seeing results, which is 24:30 super super awesome and another thing 24:32 that i'm super excited about just for 24:34, the future of the course and going 24:36 Forward 24:36 is that i've got all of the heavy 24:39 lifting done. I'Ve got all of the work up, 24:41 front done 24:42 and i'm truly able to start making this 24:44 course super passive and scalable 24:46, and it's something that i've truly 24:47 poured so much time to making sure 24:50. It'S a great experience for students. 24:51. It'S something that it's gon na be 24:52 helpful. It'S to the point 24:54, even though i keep saying like this 24:55 course is super and, like all inclusive 24:58 of what they need to know 24:59. The actual video time for this course i 25:01 think, is like 13 and a half hours 25:03, which really, when you we're talking 25:05 about. Of course, it's this long 25:06. A lot of similar courses that i've seen 25:08 are 30 to 35 plus hours, long 25:11, and so that's something. I'M super proud, 25:12 of. If they're able to get quick results, 25:14 they're able to learn things quickly. 25:16, that's a great experience, learning 25:17 things and super excited that it's a 25:19 course that i'm able to truly be so 25:21 proud of and stand behind and put out 25:23 into the world 25:24 over and over again going forward and 25:26 truly start making it Into more of a 25:28 passive income stream 25:29, if you liked this kind of content, give 25:31 this video a thumbs up and comment below 25:32, and let me know, do you want me to do 25:34 more of these videos in the future 25:35? Was it interesting to see more of a 25:37 behind-the-scenes look into how i 25:38 created and launched my course 25:40 and made it successful? I'D love to know 25:42, your thoughts and, if you would love to 25:44, see more of these in the future because 25:46, i don't know i personally just love 25:48 listening to videos and podcasts 25:50 like this, because so often like two we 25:53 can hear about. Oh, like this person made 25:55 this much in one week or 25:56, this amount, or they had this much 25:59 success 26:00, but we also don't realize, like there's 26:03, so much more. That goes to it than that 26:04 there's so much more behind it. Like i, 26:06 didn't even talk about in this video 26:08, my expenses with this launch, like i 26:10, might have generated twenty five 26:11 thousand dollars 26:12, but i paid a copywriter three thousand 26:14 dollars to create copy for this 26:15 course launch. I hired a facebook team 26:18, which is two thousand dollars a month on 26:19 top of my ad spend like 26:21 there's just so many things that go into 26:23, creating a course like this 26:24, and so my heart. Behind sharing these 26:26 things is to show you like 26:27, it's not all easy. It'S a lot of work, 26:30, there's so many hours that go 26:31 into it. There'S so much time that goes 26:33 into it. There'S so much of an investment 26:35 that goes into 26:36, launching something like this, and so i 26:38 just really wanted to yeah just share 26:39 about that with you guys, 26:40 and also just share the wins, like you, 26:42 guys are what made this possible, and So 26:44, it's cool to almost like 26:46 share that with you guys and for you 26:47 guys to be excited with me, 26:49 for the results that are happening and 26:51 for how my business is growing, so 26:53. I personally enjoy it, and i appreciate 26:55 people who are more transparent about 26:57, their numbers and what's going on behind 26:59 the scenes and how things are actually 27:01 happening. 27:01. So if you like this, let me know in the 27:03 comments, if you agree with that and if 27:04 you 27:05 enjoy them too, because i would love to 27:06, keep doing them.
