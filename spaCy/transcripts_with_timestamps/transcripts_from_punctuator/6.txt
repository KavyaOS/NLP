00:00, are you thinking about moving to a new 00:01 city to pursue acting? If so, are you 00:04 considering Atlanta and if you're not 00:07, considering Atlanta, should you be 00:12 [, Music, ] 00:21? What is up my fellow actors welcome to 00:25 the acting career center here to help 00:27 you break into the film and television 00:29 industry, so you can create the acting 00:32 career of your dreams. My name is Kurt 00:35. You honored to be here with you today: 00:37 talking about the opportunities for 00:40 actors in Atlanta, but before we get 00:43 started on that topic 00:45, I got a few quick housekeeping notes to 00:48 get to because I have not made a video 00:51 in a Long time so if you have been a 00:55 subscriber to this channel for a while 00:57, maybe since I started it back in 2014, 01:00, first of all, thank you. 01:02. Second of all, I really apologize for not 01:06 making a video in a while, but one of the 01:08 main reasons for my hiatus is Atlanta. My 01:13 acting career has gotten really really 01:16 busy after I moved here to Atlanta, hence 01:19. The reason for this video, so one thing 01:23 you may have noticed - is that the name of 01:25. The channel has changed what used to be 01:28 small market actor is now acting career 01:30 center. Now part of the reason for the 01:33 change is actually Atlanta, because I no 01:36 longer live in a small market 01:38. I moved from Cleveland Ohio to Atlanta 01:41 Georgia back in 2016 and Atlanta. Just 01:44 happens to be one of the biggest film 01:47 and television production cities in the 01:49 world right now, which we will talk about 01:51 later, so a small market actor and small 01:57 market actor dot-com are no more and in 01:59, their place. We now have acting career 02:01 center and acting career center, comm and 02:04. I think this name. This new name of the 02:09 channel is actually a better reflection, 02:13 of what I originally intended for it to 02:16, be anyway, because what I really wanted 02:19 to do with this channel in the beginning 02:21 was to help educate people to help to 02:25 help People who were newer actors who 02:27 were new to the industry, who wanted to 02:29, make this career but didn't know how to 02:31 and I've been a working actor since 02:34, 2009 and in that time I've gained so 02:39 much knowledge and so much experience 02:40. That I hope to to share with you to 02:43. Hopefully, you know lead you down the 02:45 right path, limit your mistakes, so that 02:48, you can continue down this road of 02:50 becoming a working professional actor 02:53 because, like I know it can be hard at 02:56 times it can be and it can be. 02:59. Frustrating at times, if you've, if you're 03:01, an actor who's been plugging along and 03:03 feel like you've made. No traction. Look I 03:05 get it. So I'm doing this to hopefully 03:08 inspire you to show you that if someone 03:10 like me, can do it. If this former 03:12 software developer, a guy who didn't 03:15 study acting in high school, didn't study 03:17 acting in college, I didn't take my first 03:19 acting class until I was 26 years old 03:21 guys. If someone like me can do this, then 03:24, you can absolutely do this too, as long 03:27 as you're willing to work hard, you're 03:29 willing to study and learn not just the 03:31 craft of acting, but also the business of 03:34. The industry and you're willing to be a 03:36 professional in every sense of the word 03:38. If you're willing to do those three 03:40 things, then I have no doubt that you 03:43 have got a shot and making this your 03:45 career, and that's exactly why I made 03:49, this channel the acting Career Center to 03:52 help. You do just that. If that sounds 03:54 like something you want to learn more 03:56 about, then hey subscribe to this channel 03:59. If you haven't already and leave me a 04:01 comment down below, if you have any 04:03 burning questions, leave me a question 04:04 down below that I could possibly answer 04:08 for you in a future video. Okay, alright, 04:11 enough housekeeping stuff. Let'S talk 04:13 about Atlanta! So back in 2015, when I was 04:16 still living in Ohio, I really had no 04:18 idea that the film and television 04:20 industry even existed down here in 04:22 Atlanta and in fact it had already been 04:25 here for years and was growing year 04:27 after Year and the thing that really 04:32 propelled the Atlanta - this is just like 04:34, a tiny little history lesson the thing 04:36 that really propelled Atlanta to 04:38 becoming what it is today was back. In 04:40, 2008 tax credit was passed by the state 04:43 that gave production companies a huge 04:47 financial and 04:48 to bring their projects to Georgia and 04:51. After that happened, there was it didn't 04:54 happen overnight, but year after year, the 04:57 film industry grew and grew and grew to 04:59. The point where now in 2020, I want to 05:03 get this number right. Film and TV has 05:05 grown to become a nine point: five 05:07 billion dollar industry in the state of 05:09 Georgia in 2016. This is a crazy fact. The 05:14 year that I moved to Atlanta in 2016 05:17. There were more major feature films made 05:20 in Georgia than in California. What I 05:27 mean that was me when I first heard that 05:29 California - that's where Hollywood is and 05:32 you're telling me more movies, were made 05:34 in Georgia than California, it's true and 05:37. The movies made in Georgia 05:39 aren't some obscure films that you've 05:41 never heard of. They are some of the 05:43 biggest blockbusters in theaters year 05:46 after year, including the 05:48 highest-grossing movie of all time of 05:51 vengers endgame yeah shot in Georgia, 05:54 down in Pinewood Studios, just south of 05:56 Atlanta. So let me give you actually a 05:59 few. More examples of movies that you've 06:01 probably heard of that were made in 06:03 Georgia. In the past decade, you ready for 06:08 this okay Avengers infinity war, Avengers 06:11 endgame Black Panther ant-man ant-man 06:14 and the wasp spider-man homecoming venom 06:17 Captain America, Civil War. Guardians of 06:19, the galaxy vol 2 hidden figures, Sully 06:22 passengers, Godzilla king of monsters, 06:24 Fast, Five Furious 7. The fate of the 06:27 Furious. I Tanya the accountant, bad mom's, 06:29 Christmas Hunger Games Catching Fire 06:31 Hunger Games, Mockingjay tag dr. sleep, 06:34, baby driver pitch, perfect 3 zombie land 06:37, Richard Jewell, oh and many many many 06:42. More! Oh wait! I didn't even mention a 06:46 single television show. All right here. 06:49 are some of the shows that were made in 06:51 Georgia. In the past decade, The Walking 06:55 Dead, stranger things, the resident, the 06:58 Vampire Diaries, the originals Ozark 07:00 watchman at 07:01, anta dynasty, black lightning, insatiable 07:04 Cobra Kai MacGyver lodge 49, the haunting 07:07 of Hill House doomed patrol halt and 07:09 catch fire. The gifted star and many many 07:14, many more, including all of Tyler Perry's, 07:17 movies and television shows being shot 07:19 in his massive 330 acres studio, lot: 07:22 right in the heart of Atlanta yeah, so 07:26. All of that has happened. All of that and 07:30 more has happened in Georgia in the past 07:34 decade, basically since 2008, crazy right, 07:37, crazy. So, okay, now back to our original 07:40 question for you should you as an actor 07:44 move to Atlanta for your acting career 07:47? Well, ultimately, that's a very personal 07:51 question right. It'S not a question that 07:52, I can just say yes or no to because it's 07:55 gon na be different for every individual 07:57. But what I can do is provide you with as 08:00 much information as possible to 08:02. Hopefully, lead you to make a better 08:05 informed decision, that's right for your 08:09 exact situation. Okay, so here are some 08:12 factors that I think you should take 08:15 into account when you're deciding 08:16, whether or not you should move to 08:17 Atlanta for acting first of all, if 08:20 you're still worried about Atlanta being 08:24, too small of a market compared To Los 08:27 Angeles or New York, if you're, still 08:29 worried that you may not get enough 08:31 opportunities in a market like Atlanta 08:33, even though I just gave you that giant 08:35 list of movies and television shows that 08:38 were being made here. If that's your main 08:41 concern, let me put that to rest right 08:43. Now I want to share with you my story, my 08:48 number of auditions, that I've been 08:52 getting for film and TV since I've been 08:54 here. Actually, I'm gon na go all the way 08:55 back to 2011, so I'm gon na give you my 08:58 number of film and TV auditions that 09:00 I've received year after year since 2011 09:02, which was back when I still lived in 09:04 Ohio and then I'll Bring it all the way 09:07 to 2019 last year, so for the past three 09:10 years living in Atlanta, all right, you 09:12 ready. In 2011, the number of film and TV 09:14 auditions 09:15 got one one total the whole year: 2012. 09:20. Zero. 2013, zero. 2014. 3. 2015. 7. 2016. 09:28. Alright, 2016 is when I moved to Atlanta 09:31 got my first agent in Atlanta number of 09:34 film and TV auditions. I got in 2016, 09:37. 76, 2017, 105, 2018, 90 to 2019, 110 wow, I 09:50 mean that's all. I can say that it's kind 09:54 of mind-boggling that I went from 09:56, getting just a couple - sometimes 0, film, 10:01 and TV auditions in a whole year to 10:03. Getting over a hundred a year I mean in 10:07 2019 a hundred and ten film and TV 10:10 auditions in a year. That'S one! Every 10:12 three days, that's crazy to me. So when I 10:16 say that the amount of opportunity in 10:19 Atlanta is huge, is almost mind-blowing 10:22, I'm not exaggerating at all. So if you're 10:26, an actor, that's thinking about moving to 10:27 Atlanta and your biggest hang-up is 10:29 wondering if you're gon na get enough 10:32 opportunities. I want to just just forget 10:36 that right and also, if there's anyone 10:39 telling you that you have to move to Los 10:42 Angeles, to pursue an acting career 10:44 they're just wrong they're wrong. They 10:47, don't know what they're talking about 10:49. Look, I'm not saying that Atlanta is the 10:53 only place. You can go, I'm not saying 10:54 that you can't go to Los Angeles, but I'm 10:57. I just want you to know that there are 10:59 other options available and Atlanta, just 11:03 happens to be one of the best options: 11:06. Okay! So then, the next question that a 11:10 lot of people have, when I say all these 11:11 crazy numbers and I'm beating all these 11:13 great opportunities people will ask well 11:17. Does that mean Atlanta is better than LA 11:19 hmmm? Well, that's an even tougher 11:22 question to answer, because better is 11:23 gon na be different for everybody, 11:26 situation again, what's better for me, may 11:28 not be better for 11:29. You may not be better for the next 11:30 person. So again, you're gon na have to 11:33 figure out exactly what you're looking 11:35 for or your specific situation is and 11:38, then, whether Atlanta or LA or New York, 11:40 or any other market has the best things 11:44 to offer you. I will say this, though I do 11:49 think if you are an actor who is just 11:51 starting out who is new to the industry 11:55 and who, who is just trying to get their 11:59 first few credits. 12:00. I think Atlanta is a better option than 12:04 LA. I actually think Atlanta might be the 12:07 best option in the country for an actor 12:09 like that, may be the best option in the 12:11 world and I'll tell you why there are in 12:16 my opinion fewer barriers to entry in 12:20 Atlanta. What do I mean by that? I mean 12:23 that you will have more access to the 12:28 things that newer actors are always 12:31 trying to get, which is yet an agent 12:35, which is start getting auditions and 12:37 just start getting out there and trying 12:40 to book roles. It is not uncommon for an 12:44 actor in Atlanta who is brand new to the 12:48 industry to be able to get an agent in 12:51, their first year in the first few months, 12:54 of being here and start auditioning 12:57 immediately for big TV shows and Big 13:00 movies, so I do think a newer actor 13:04 coming to Atlanta versus a newer actor 13:07. In the same situation going to LA, I 13:09 think that actor in Atlanta is going to 13:12 have an easier time. Getting an agent is 13:16 going to have a little bit of an easier 13:17 time getting auditions getting their 13:21 first few auditions and it's gon na have 13:23 a little bit of an easier time, probably 13:25 booking their first few jobs. So the 13:29 reason behind that is that no there's a 13:33 few reasons. One is that there are there 13:35. There are just fewer actors in Atlanta 13:38, so a little bit less competition now 13:40. That'S not to say, there's there 13:42, that many actors in Atlanta. There are a 13:44 ton of actors here, and there are more 13:46 moving here day by day, but compared to 13:49 LA Atlanta is nowhere near as saturated 13:52 as a market, like Los Angeles. Another 13:56 factor is that, like I mentioned before 13:58, it's not uncommon for an agent and a 14:02, pretty good agent in Atlanta to sign an 14:07 actor. Who doesn't really have that much 14:09 experience who to sign them right out 14:11, the gate and start giving them auditions 14:13 and start giving them opportunities 14:15, whereas in Los Angeles now full 14:18 disclosure? I'Ve never lived in Los 14:20 Angeles, but I've had friends that live 14:22 there and I've heard their stories and 14:25 from what I hear that situation that I 14:29 described for an actor in Atlanta. That 14:32 doesn't happen in LA what's more common 14:34 in them. In LA is that agents want to see 14:39 legitimate film and television credits 14:41, mostly television credits on your resume 14:44, before they're willing to sign you 14:47, which puts newer actors in kind of a 14:50 catch-22 of well. How do I get credits 14:53 before I have an agent and then how do I 14:55 get an agent before I have credits it 14:57 depend of doesn't make sense right so 14:59. For those reasons it does it. It is a 15:04 little bit easier for a newer actor to 15:08 kind of break in to the industry here in 15:11 Atlanta, compared to some of the bigger 15:13 markets like in LA or New York. Another 15:17 factor that would make Atlanta a more 15:20 desirable place, and this goes beyond 15:23. Newer actors is that the cost of living 15:26 in Atlanta is a lot better than the cost 15:30 of living, in Los Angeles. You'Ve, probably 15:32 already heard the stories of how how 15:35 expensive it is. It is to live in a place 15:37, like Los Angeles Angeles, so I just 15:39 pulled up them. Numbers of the median 15:43 rent in LA for a one-bedroom apartment 15:45 is the median rent in LA for a 15:48 one-bedroom apartment is two thousand 15:50 three hundred sixty two dollars now the 15:52 median rent in at 15:53 Lanta for a one-bedroom apartment is 15:56 1,590 Dollar, so that's like an $ 800 16:00 difference there. That'S not to say that 16:03 different neighborhoods are gon na have 16:05 are gon na, be higher or lower in each 16:08 city, but this is just on average you're, 16:11 gon na be paying a lot less for the same 16:14 thing in Atlanta for your living. 16:16 situation than in Los Angeles, also, if 16:19 you're looking to buy a place, the medium 16:22, the median home price in Los Angeles, is 16:26 six hundred and thirty-four thousand 16:28 dollars and the median home price in 16:31. Atlanta is two hundred and ten thousand 16:34 dollars, so that's just it's just more 16:38 affordable to live here, I'll use myself 16:40. As an example I can afford to live in 16:43 this place. I I've been fortunate enough 16:46 to buy my place here in Atlanta, and I 16:50 would not be able to afford a place like 16:52. This, in Los Angeles, it would cost many 16:54 times more than I paid for here, and I've 16:57 actually heard many stories about actors 17:01, in Los Angeles, who blew through all of 17:03. Their savings in less than a year and 17:05 had to move back home because they just 17:08 weren't ready for how much it actually 17:11 cost to live there and the people that 17:16 are living there and haven't moved back 17:19 home. It feels like they're spending. All 17:21 of their time, working just trying to 17:24 make enough money to pay rent and live 17:27 and survive, and they don't have money 17:29 for acting classes and they don't have 17:31 money for headshots and they don't have 17:32 money to actually pursue their career. 17:34, because it's so expensive to live in 17:36 that city again, I haven't lived there so 17:40. I can't do a real apples-to-apples 17:42 comparison, but I will say I feel very 17:47, financially stable, where I am right now: 17:51 in Atlanta, okay, earlier I said that it 17:54 was easier for an actor in Atlanta to 17:57 kind of break into the industry compared 18:00, to that same actor in Los Angeles - and I 18:02 want to make a distinction. I want to 18:04 make 18:04 very clear that I'm saying it's easier. 18:07, not easy. It'S certainly not easy to 18:11 break into this industry, no matter what 18:13 market you're in okay, so I don't want to 18:16 make this sound like a la bashing 18:19 session. I'M certainly not saying that 18:21 there's anything wrong with LA or 18:23 there's anything bad with LA there's 18:25. Just these differences and there are 18:27 certain reasons why someone may want to 18:30 go to LA instead of Atlanta. So let's 18:34 talk about a few of those first of all 18:36 and this is kind of a Hollywood thing. 18:39, but Hollywood does have this kind of 18:41 mystique about it. Hollywood does have 18:44 that I mean there's this: the the 18:47 romantic idea of going to Hollywood to 18:50 pursue your dreams as an actor right 18:52. It'S that it's that dream that every kid 18:55 has growing up. So, if you're in love with 18:58, that idea that that story that that 19:02 story that lala land presented to us in 19:04 that movie, if you're in love with that 19:06, then there's probably there's probably 19:09. Nothing that I can say or anyone else 19:11 can say to tell you to go to a different 19:13 market because Atlanta, it certainly 19:14, isn't LA it's it's different. It'S got 19:17, its own great things about it, but it is 19:19 in that city. So if you're in love with 19:23, that idea of pursuing your career in 19:26, Hollywood and by all means go do that 19:28, because no other city is gon na be able 19:31 to give that to you. 19:33. Another thing is the lifestyle. The 19:36 lifestyle in LA is just that's another 19:40 animal in itself and if that's something 19:43 that you desire, if you love that weather 19:46, if you want the same 65 to 70 degree, 19:49 weather year-round. If you want to get 19:51 out there on the beach and surf, if you 19:53 want to, if you want that potential 19:57 opportunity to run into a Warner, 19:59 Brothers executive at a coffee shop on a 20:01 Saturday morning, LA you've got to go to 20:06. La for that right, but then now here are 20:10, some real legitimate things for for 20:13 actors: career wise, sitcom 20:17. If your, if your thing is sitcoms and you 20:22 think you're an actor that will that 20:25 will really thrive in a sitcom and you 20:28 want to audition for sitcoms, you got to 20:30 go to LA. There are no sitcoms being shot 20:33 in Atlanta right now, none in at least in 20:37, 2020. There'S, none being shot here. Right, 20:39, now, 20:39 same thing, with soap operas no soap 20:42 operas in Atlanta. If your thing is, you 20:44 want to be on a soap opera. You want to 20:46 pursue that above everything else. Then 20:49, you got to go to LA there's, no question 20:51 about it. There'S there there were soap 20:53 operas in New York, but I don't think 20:54. There are any there now either, so you 20:57 really just got to go to LA for that 20:58. Another thing I want to say about LA is 21:01, that for newer actors, I'm not saying 21:04 - that newer actors should never go to LA 21:06. I think Atlanta is the best option for a 21:08 actor trying to break into the industry 21:11 right now. But there's no reason to to 21:15 think that you can't come to Atlanta and 21:17 start your career off here and if you 21:20 start gaining some traction and start 21:22 booking and start building credits on 21:24. Your resume and really start making 21:27 getting a good demo reel together, maybe 21:29. At that point. Maybe that point is when 21:32 you go to LA, because now you'll be more 21:35 desirable to to agents into casting in a 21:38 place, like Los Angeles rather than the 21:40, the hordes of people that move there 21:42 every year who have zero experience so 21:45. The last thing I'll say is that I've 21:46 been in Atlanta since 2016. I have no 21:49 plans on moving to LA anytime, soon. 21:52. I have no plans on moving to New York or 21:54 anywhere else. For that matter right. I 21:56 really love it here. I love my situation. 21:58 here I love my agent 22:00. I love the auditions that I'm getting. I 22:02 am booking I'm getting to work on sets 22:05 of some big huge movies and television 22:08 shows every year and I can afford to own 22:13 a home, and I can also afford to rent an 22:16 office space for my photography business 22:19. I it! Oh there's one more thing that 22:23 about Atlanta that I'd have. I should 22:25 always tell people. I love the community 22:29, here 22:30 of just from the top down from the 22:34 actors to the teachers, to the agents to 22:36. The casting directors to just everybody 22:39 in the community here in Atlanta in this 22:43 industry, is so supportive of one another 22:46 and wants to see each other succeed. I 22:50, just it just warms my heart thinking 22:54 about the actors here in Atlanta and how 22:57 much they are cheering each other on 23:00, it's great and again, I've never lived in 23:05, Los Angeles or New York or another big 23:09 acting market. But just from accounts 23:12 from friends of mine, I don't hear them 23:15 saying the same thing about the 23:16 communities in those cities and when 23:20 I've met other actors that have moved 23:21 here from the bigger markets that have 23:25 moved to Atlanta. They say the same thing 23:27: they see something different about the 23:29 community here and how supportive of it 23:32 is of one another. So I love that about 23:36 Atlanta, and I think that is a huge plus 23:38. If that's something that you value then 23:42 really consider Atlanta. Alright, that's 23:47 about all. I got to say. I know that it 23:50 might have sounded a little biased 23:51 because I live here in Atlanta, but I'm 23:55 certainly not trying to convince anyone 23:58 to move here, but if you're in a position 24:01, where you're thinking about moving to 24:03 another market.
