00:00, if you want to be cast in a movie or a 00:01 television, show, it's really important to 00:03 understand 00:04, exactly how the casting process works 00:06, because the audition is not the only 00:08 step in the process. 00:10. As actors, we really only know about the 00:12 audition, because it's the only step that 00:14. We are directly involved in right 00:16, but there are steps before and after the 00:19 audition that are just as significant 00:21 and if you don't understand how those 00:23 steps affect you 00:25, you could be sabotaging your own chances 00:27 of getting booked 00:28. So today, let's talk about exactly how 00:32 the entire casting process works. 00:45. What'S up my fellow actors welcome to 00:47 the acting career center here to help 00:48.

Let'S 01:54 talk about today's topic, which is how 01:56 the casting process 01:57 works. I'M going to give you a kind of a 02:00 high level, 02:01 overview of the casting process. There 02:03 are specific 02:04 details that are different from case to 02:07 case from 02:08 project to project. So i'm not gon na go 02:10 into the weeds of all that. But i will 02:12 give you kind of a bird's-eye view 02:15 of how, in general, the casting process. 02:17 works for a movie 02:18 or a television show i'll break down the 02:21 13 02:21 steps that it takes to cast a role in a 02:25 movie or a show 02:26, and how your audition kind of fits into 02:28. Those steps. Okay. So, let's start with an 02:30 example: let's say: there's a new movie: 02:31! That'S going to be made 02:32 uh! Let say a disney movie once that 02:36 movie 02:36 is done being written once the writers 02:38 have finished, writing the script 02:40. They now need to cast the movie right so 02:43. The producers now 02:45 need to hire a casting director. This is 02:47 step. One 02:48. The producers of the movie hire a 02:50 casting director 02:51 to help them cast the movie. The casting 02:53 director then takes that script 02:55, and they will go through it and find 02:57 every single role that needs to be cast 02:59 and create breakdowns for those roles. A 03:02 breakdown 03:03 is just the short description of each 03:06 role, 03:06 inside the script and then step two is 03:09 that the casting director will then 03:11 send those breakdowns out to agents 03:14. Sometimes those breakdowns will be sent 03:16 publicly posted publicly as well. On 03:19 sites like actors, access 03:20, so that uh individual actors can access 03:23, those 03:24, but most of the time for big budget 03:27 movies and television shows 03:29. They go directly to agents and will not 03:31 be posted publicly. I would say 95 03:34 of the time or more breakdowns only go 03:37 to agents and will not be posted 03:39 publicly, so that actors cannot access 03:41 them 03:42 directly. That'S why it is so important 03:44 that an actor 03:46 get an agent at some point. In their 03:48 career 03:49, all right now that the agent has the 03:50 breakdowns. They will then take those 03:52 breakdowns and compare it to their 03:54 roster 03:55 of all the actors they represent and see 03:58, who 03:58 fits each role so, for simplicity's sake, 04:01. In 04:01 our example, let's only focus on one 04:04 particular role because 04:06, a full movie script can have 50 or more 04:09. Roles that need to be cast from the 04:11 lead all the way down to all the 04:12 supporting roles. But let's just focus on 04:14 one role for simplicity, let's say: 04:17, there's a role for 04:18, a a person that works at a coffee, shop, 04:20 and 04:21. The description is ages, 16 to 25, 04:25, male or female. So that's the character, 04:27 breakdown. So if i'm an agent, i get that 04:30 character breakdown. I then look at my 04:31 roster of all the actors i represent and 04:33. I say: hey 04:34. Here are all the people that fit that 04:36 breakdown. Okay, and once i find that 04:39 group of people 04:40, all of those actors that fit the 04:41 breakdown, i then send the headshot 04:43 resume and demo reel of all of those 04:46 actors, 04:47 back to the casting director and say: hey 04:49 casting director 04:50. Here are all of the actors that i 04:52 represent, that fit 04:53, this character; okay, so we're not 04:55 involving the actors. Yet this is 04:57 only communication between the casting 04:59 director 05:00 and the agent so far, so that was step 05:02. Three, the agent 05:04. Now sending all of the actors they 05:06 represent 05:07 back to the casting director for a 05:09 particular role. 05:10. Now that the casting director has 05:12 received all of those headshots resumes 05:14 and demo reels 05:16, they now look at all of these actors and 05:18 decide 05:19, which ones they would like to see 05:21 audition. Now, in an ideal world 05:24, every single actor would get a chance to 05:26 audition but 05:27. Unfortunately, in the real world there 05:30 just 05:30. Isn'T that much time available, that's 05:33, the main problem, the casting director 05:35, does not have enough time to audition 05:37. Every single actor that wants to 05:40 audition 05:40 because think about it, we're only 05:42 talking about one agent here, 05:45. Typically, a casting director will reach 05:47 out to dozens of agents 05:49. So if dozens of agents all send all of 05:52, their actors that fit this particular 05:55 coffee shop, 05:56 worker role, the casting director could 05:58 potentially get a submission of 06:00 hundreds or even thousands of actor. 06:03 headshots 06:04. There'S no way that the casting director 06:06 can audition 06:07 hundreds or thousands of people for that 06:10. One role 06:11 because remember there are 50 other 06:13 roles that need to be cast for this 06:15 movie, 06:16 right. So for this particular role, they 06:18 might only be able to see 06:20 20 or 30 actors. That means for each 06:23 agency that submitted, they might only be 06:26 able to audition 06:27 one actor or two actors per each 06:30 agency. This is why it is so important to 06:33 have a great 06:35 head shot, because in this step of the 06:37 process 06:38, how are you going to stand out to a 06:40 casting director 06:41? The casting director is looking at a sea 06:43 of hundreds of head shots 06:46 and they have to decide and pick 20 or 06:48 30 out of all of those 06:50 of those people that they want to see 06:52 audition. So you have to have a headshot 06:54 that really catches their eye 06:56 and really stands out for them to decide. 06:58. Oh, i want to see this person audition 07:00. So that is step four step. Four is the 07:03 casting director 07:04 selecting which actors they would like 07:07 to see audition 07:08 and then telling that to the agent 07:09 saying hey agent 07:11. Thank you for sending me all of these 07:13 actors that fit this role. 07:14. Here are the two actors i would like to 07:16 see audition, please, 07:18. Moving on to step five step. Five is now 07:21, the agent now passing that information 07:24 along to the actor 07:26. Now, finally, the actor comes into play. 07:29. The agent will then tell the actor: hey 07:32. You got an audition, and here are the 07:34 sides 07:34 step. Six is then the actor preparing for 07:37 the audition - and this is the part that 07:39 we are all familiar with 07:41 as actors. Now we finally have the 07:43 audition sides. We have the role that we 07:45 need to audition for 07:47, and now we have time to get ready for 07:49, the audition 07:50. In my experience. Typically, you have 07:52 between 24 and 48 hours to prepare for 07:55. An audition 07:56 occasionally i will have more than 48 07:58 hours 07:59, maybe uh an extra day but 08:02. Very very rarely will i have more than 08:05 four days to prepare for an audition. I 08:07 would say on 08:08 average, it's about 48 hours. Now you 08:10 might be asking 08:12. How can you prepare a really really 08:14 great audition in less than 48 hours? 08:16? Well, i'm glad you asked i've actually 08:18 created a free 08:20 10-step audition preparation cheat sheet 08:22. That will help you 08:24 nail, your audition. Every single time so 08:26, if you want to download that free cheat 08:28 sheet, you can get it by going to that 08:30 link. 08:30 right up there. Now that you've prepared 08:32, your audition 08:33 step, seven is actually doing the 08:36 audition 08:37. The audition can be live and in person 08:39 or 08:40, what's a little bit more common. These 08:42 days is doing a self tape which is 08:44 recording your audition at home 08:46 and then sending it electronically to 08:49. The casting director 08:50 step 8 is the casting director reviewing 08:53 every single 08:54 audition from each of the actors. If they 08:57 were in-person auditions 08:58, they would have all been recorded in the 09:00 room, so the casting director will watch 09:02. All of those auditions back again, 09:04 or if they were self taped. The casting 09:06 director will just watch 09:08, all of those tapes. At this point, there 09:11 could 09:11 or could not be callbacks depending on 09:14, the project and, depending on the role 09:17, a callback is when a casting director 09:20 then brings back 09:21 some of the actors that they really 09:23 liked. For that particular role. 09:24. To give them a second round of auditions 09:27, if an actor gets a call back, that means 09:29. They are really interested in them. For 09:31, the role 09:31 they've they've been brought back, not 09:34. Everybody gets 09:35 brought back for a callback. They usually 09:37 only bring back the people that they are 09:38 really 09:39 interested. In now, some auditions don't 09:42 have callbacks. Sometimes they will 09:44 just book the actor off of the initial 09:47 auditions 09:48. Some will have one round of callbacks 09:50. Some others will have 09:51 even more than one brown. Some will have 09:53 producer sessions and network tests and 09:56 all kinds of stuff 09:57. So that's why i say step nine here is 10:00 that there might be call backs there. 10:01 might not be but just understand what 10:03 they 10:04 are in this process after the callbacks 10:06. The casting director will then make 10:08 their recommendations for each role of 10:10, the project to the producers, so that is 10:12 step. 10 10:13. The casting director recommending their 10:15 top three or top five 10:16 actors for each role to the producers. 10:19 for a final casting decision, 10:21 step 11. The final casting decision now 10:24 needs to be made 10:26. It'S important to understand that the 10:27 casting director does not make 10:30 the final casting decision. They may have 10:32 influence 10:33, but they are not. The final decision, 10:35 maker 10:36 for a television show the final decision. 10:39 makers are the producers, the show runner 10:41 and the network for a movie 10:43. It'S usually the producers and the 10:46 director, but the important thing 10:47 is that it is not the casting director 10:49. The casting director does have an 10:51 important role 10:52 in the beginning of the process, because 10:54 they select who they want to see 10:56 audition. So in a way they do decide who 10:59 has a 11:00 chance of booking the part. But when it 11:02 comes to the very end 11:03, they don't make that final decision so 11:05. That was step 11. step. 12 11:07 is once that final decision is made. The 11:10 casting director 11:11 then extends an offer to the agent of 11:14 that actor 11:15 and then step 13 is the final step. The 11:18 agent then 11:18 passes along that offer to the actor and 11:21 says: 11:22: hey actor. You have just booked the role. 11:25 of 11:25 coffee shop worker on this new disney 11:28 movie, all right that was a peek behind 11:30. The curtain of how this whole casting 11:31 process works. 11:32. I hope this clears things up a little 11:34 bit.
