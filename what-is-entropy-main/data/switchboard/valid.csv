okay.
uh first um I need to know uh how do you feel about uh about sending uh an elderly uh family member to a nursing home.
well of course it you know it one of the last few things in the world you ever want to do you know.
unless it just you know really you know and uh for their uh you know for their own good.
yes.
yeah.
I be very very careful and uh you know checking them out.
uh our had t- place my mother in a nursing home.
she had a rather massive stroke about uh about.
uh-huh.
uh eight months ago I guess.
and uh we were I was fortunate in that I was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown.
yeah.
so I was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it.
but there well I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience.
uh it had to be done in a hurry.
I mean we did n't have you know like six months to check all of these places out.
and it was really not not very good uh deal.
yeah.
we were not really happy with.
yeah.
nursing home that we finally had.
fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to to return to her apartment again.
but it really a big uh big uh.
yeah.
decision as to you know when to do it.
you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available.
of course you know there not one on every corner.
yeah.
especially you know smaller areas.
uh-huh.
smaller towns.
uh-huh.
yeah.
probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home and um she had used the walker for for quite some time probably about six to nine months.
and um she had a fall and uh finally uh she had Parkinson disease.
oh.
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house.
right.
then she lived in an apartment and uh that was even harder.
uh-huh.
actually.
uh-huh.
because it was you know it was just a change of change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling.
yes.
I mean she tr- she had she had children all across the United States.
Uh-huh.
and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children.
right.
uh-huh.
and um that was pretty heart-rending for her.
I can imagine.
I think when she finally came to the realization that you know no I can not I can not take care of myself.
uh-huh.
that tough.
that tough.
yeah.
I mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh not just merely had a farm but had ten children.
uh-huh.
had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines.
uh-huh.
and you know facing that situation it it quite a dilemma.
yes.
I think.
my mother excuse me.
go ahead.
yeah.
well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision.
uh-huh.
than just delegate it.
I think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference.
that great.
and I mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that.
that right.
and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them.
right.
yeah.
and you know making that decision and then finding a place and everybody had duties.
uh-huh.
to perform.
you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot.
uh-huh.
of the decision making you know.
yep.
like finding a proper nursing home.
you were very.
and they.
fortunate.
I know.
they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming.
uh-huh.
so so I mean it I mean I I I I har- I I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like.
uh-huh.
that for me.
uh-huh.
absolutely.
unfortunately a lot of times it responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know.
yeah.
yeah.
well we we.
