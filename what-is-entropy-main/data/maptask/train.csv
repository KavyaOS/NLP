just past seven beeches and no more.
right.
right.
could you move down about three inches to the eh top of reclaimed fields.
mmhmm right.
right eh.
could you just go move round to your right round reclaimed fields just round the reclaimed fields.
right.
and down.
and down you know just round it as in what a sort of eh.
right.
so under reclaimed fields.
circle round it.
you're under reclaimed fields now.
eh could you move u-- could you continue that line just a wee bit to the bottom left-hand corner of reclaimed fields.
right.
yeah.
i have.
right okay.

i'm still on the crane bay line.
mmhmm just follow the line of the bay.
and you'll move off towards the attractive cliffs.
mmhmm.
do i mean do i have to draw off the line of the bay.
yeah.
i mean like you'll have to to g-- go away from the.
above the line of the a-- a-- above attractive cliffs.
right above attractive cliffs yes.
t-- right to the edge of them i am.
right.
ehm.
from there just just move out past them to your left and then move down to about the eh move down past the left-hand of the attractive cliffs to about the corner the bottom left corner.
right that okay.
right could you eh then move to the edge of the paper on your left about another that'll be about another two inches i would've said.
right to the edge.
i mean it'll have to be completely to the edge because of the crashed spaceship.
right there's a crashed spaceship there.
right i thought you were w-- right move right to the edge and i'll try and avoid that crashed spaceship.
okay i'll do my best.

yeah.
well go above that.
above the c--.
up and you go directly beside the collapsed shelter by about er say fifteen centimetres above the creva-- crevice.
right.
so have you got.
right so.
go about five centimetres above the crevasse.

directly above the start point.
five centimetres above the crevi-- crevasse.
uh-huh.
which is fifteen centimetres from where i am now.
eh well.
not as much as that.
well.
okay right.
ehm.
that's where i want to be.
by about a centimetre above the crevasse then.
yeah.
and go along the top of the crevasse.
right.
to cross to the left-hand side of it.
er.
by.
you've got the saxon barn haven't you.
well.
yeah.
you go along and you go from above the crevasse well from the side down to under just under the saxon barn in a slope.
so i'm curving ab-- i'm sloping then.
yeah.
so i'm now under the saxon barn.
er at the right-hand side.
right.
yes well.
okay.
and go along 'til you get to the end of the saxon barn.
right.
to your left.
okay.
and is there a an do you see another obstacle.
no.
below no.
go.
i've got a white mountain.
a white mountain whereabouts oh.
directly above the saxon barn.
no no no no.
right okay.
no it's below.
erm go down by about four centimetres.
right.
erm.
go along four.
well go along five.
which way.
which way.
left.
right.
how much of the path have i done by the way am i over halfway there.
erm.
just under halfway yeah.
just tons to go.
and you've got the white mountain above you yeah.
yeah right.
yeah.
so.
you go up say six centimetres u-- dilec rectly across from the saxon barn to your left.
so i'm now opposite the saxon barn.
yes.
right.
and you slope towards the white mountain and past the white mountain.
on the right-hand side.
the slope.
on the left-hand side.
the left.
by one centimetre.
but that's not sloping it should be.
well gentle sl-- very gentle slope.
so i'm now at the left-hand side of the bottom of the white mountain.
er go along the side er away from the m-- white mountain by a-- from the s-- left side of a white mountain by about one centimetre.
am i to go up to the top of the mountain.
yeah.
'til you reach the peak.
so am i actually going to the peak of the wh-- white mountain.
stop.
no you don't.
you go one centimetre to the left of the peak same level as the peak and.
to.
wait a minute one centimetre to the left of the peak.
yeah.
right.
need my tippex now.
so it's like.
right i've got it i've got it right.
and er.
do you see any other obstacles.
i've got some submerged rocks to the r-- to the right.
ssss.
to the right.
how close to the right.
ah about ten to fifteen centimetres away ten quite a way away anyway.
okay.
not near enough just now.
right.
well.
go up six centimetres directly up.
okay.
and is there a mountain slate mountain.
i've got a slate mountain to the right.
yes.
well.
are you dir-- directly opposite that.
just about.
the bottom of it yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
well.
go along and go along to your right one until you get about one centimetre from the slate mountain again and.
right.
along the slope one centimetre away from it.
do i climb it just like the white mountain.
yeah similar to it.
yeah you go right over the peak and.
right.
so i'm at the top.
right and down the other side.
down again yeah.
okay.
and er is the obstacle you mentioned anywhere near.
no.
i've got a golden beach underneath me.
no.
yeah.
i've got a golden beach as well.
that's quite a bit away.
yeah.
yeah.
well.
go two centimetres down from the bottom of the sli-- slate mountain on your right just two centimetres down.
okay.
and go along left 'til you're about one centimetre away from the bottom of the slate mountain directly beneath the slate mountain that is.
oh on the left-hand side.
yeah on the left-hand side of.
one centimetre away.
so i'm getting near to where i jumped over the mountain.
yeah.
only underneath it right.
now i've got some submerged rocks underneath me here.
how close.
directly underneath.
directly underneath.
well just um.
if i go another couple of centimetres i'll be miss them.
you'll miss them.
if you go along a couple.
mmhmm.
to the left.
er well.
go along another couple of centimetres then.
so i'm under the point where i jumped over the mountain now.
you're under just well under to you should be under to the left.
under the point where i jumped over the mountain.
off the point where i jumped over the mountain.
yeah.
one centimetre to the left.
of the point.
yeah.
okay.
right.
i've missed the rocks now if i go if i go straight down i'll miss the rocks.
erm you okay.
right.
erm eh go along another one centimetre.
right.
okay.
erm.
down directly down until you are opposite to the right of the white mountain the bottom of the white mountain.
have you got a secret valley.
yes.
so.
are you going to go right through this.
hit it no.
no.
no.
so.
i'm now at the bottom left of the secret valley.
yes.
right.
ah.
just go about one centimetre down from the where the white mountain is er you should be opposite from the white mountain so one centimetre down again.
right.
and along you sh-- 'til you're just under the secret right-hand side of the secret valley now.
and along by one centimetre.
right.
okay.
that's you.
that's me.
yeah well it should be anyway.
okay ehm.
are you starting above the missionary camp.
missionary camp where's that.
the bottom right-hand corner.
oh right yeah.
right erm.
have you got gorillas in the bottom left.
no.
i've got banana tree.
right okay.
well you want to go along to the end of the missionary camp left.
right.
and then down.
right.
to about four centimetres from the top of the page and then.
the bottom of the page you mean.
yeah.
right.
and then go left.
mmhmm.
straight along until you get to the gorillas or the banana tree or whatever it is.
right.
and then up so that you're about.
have you got a rope bridge.
mmhmm.
well.
you go up and then you turn right across the rope bridge.
right.
you go over the rope bridge and then you go down straight down a couple of centimetres.
mm.
have you got a waterfall.
mmhmm.
with water coming out of it yeah.
yeah.
well.
if you just go sort of about an angle of ten degrees.
along the river.
oh i don't have a river.
oh right.
about an angle of ten degrees along so that you come to the edge of the waterfall.
right.
about the bottom.
yeah.
uh-huh.
then.
do you have lost steps.
yeah.
way up the top of the page.
no.
uh-huh.
have you got fallen pillars.
sort of in the middle.
yeah.
mmhmm.
well.
to the left well to the left.
they should.
above the rope bridge.
yeah.
well.
i've got some lost steps to-- to the right of that.
okay.
under the gazelles.
you don't have gazelles.
well yeah i do.
but.
erm.
just.
between the rope bridge and the waterfall in line with the fallen pillars.
between the rope bridge and the waterfall right okay.
so you want to come up from the waterfall.
mmhmm.
straight up.
straight up.
uh-huh.
right.
'til you get.
to in line with the fallen pillars.
to the top of them.
and then you go along.
mmhmm.
left.
yeah.
about four centimetres and then you curve down so that you're going underneath the fallen pillars.
right.
now you should be at the end of the fallen pillars.
right.
and you've to go down about four centimetres.
right.
and curve round along left.
to the left.
do you have flamingoes.
no but.
well i do.
so you go round them.
right.
and up.
well now.
if you just sort of curve round until you're in line with the fallen pillars but you're still going sort of straight up if you know.
right.
what i mean.
and do you have ancient ruins.
got a ruined city with three wee birds at the top.
i think it's the same thing.
ehm just sort of go about an angle of eighty degrees so that you're approaching that but you don't go into it you stick to the left-hand side of it.
right okay.
right.
until you reach there.
then in the top left there's some stones.
top left of where.
of the map.
no i don't.
right.
well they're about four centimetres from the top.
right.
so you've to go straight up from the ruins to about four centimetres from the top.
straight up up from the middle of the ruins or straight up from the left.
from about the left.
right.
right.
and then you've to turn right.
mmhmm.
and you've got a white mountain.
mmhmm.
to the left-hand side of the white mountain.
now go up one side and down the other.
and underneath the white mountain there's a soft furnishings store.
mm don't have that.
well.
it's about the it's about three or four centimetres down from the white mountain.
from the middle of it.
uh-huh.
it's about the same width.
s-- so like curving.
oh right i see.
ehm so if you come from the right-hand side of the mountain.
mmhmm.
along and you want to go over the soft furnishing store.
so.
sort of diagonally between them both then.
well.
you come down from moun-- mountain and curve round.
curve round the mountain.
to where.
the middle or the other end.
the bottom of the mountain.
until you get to the left-hand side of the white mountain.
right okay.
that sort of.
so i've nearly made a circle round it.
yeah.
right.
now you're going.
you have the gazelles.
yeah.
down quite a bit uh-huh.
you're going straight down and underneath them.
to their left or their right.
the right.
right.
okay erm.
are you underneath the gazelles.
yeah.
in the middle.
uh-huh.
right.
just go right so that you're in line with the right-hand side of the white mountain.
do i turn back and go right sort of thing.
or i'm no meant to be in the middle of the gazelles.
right.
you've come down from the soft furnishing store you've come straight down.
the right-hand side of the gazelles and then turn right.
you've you've come straight down okay.
mm okay nearly.
from the soft furnishing store.
ah.
right okay uh-huh.
and you've gone underneath the gaz-- gazelles and you're turning right sort of a right angle.
okay.
right.
what've you got.
i'm now underneath the right-hand side of the white mountain.
uh-huh.
oh yeah uh-huh.
like.
just over halfway.
like in line with the gazelles.
uh-huh sort of.
right uh-huh.
about two thirds of the way up the page.
yeah.
right that's okay.
that's it.
that's it right.
okay ehm.
you've got your starting point at the top.
yeah.
can you see a diamond mine.
yes uh-huh.
right.
i want you to go straight down about three inches past that diamond mine on the left-hand side of it.
right.
okay.
ehm can you see a graveyard.
ehm no.
right that's okay.
ehm could you just head right about f-- sic-- five inches to the right once you've once you're about an inch past the diamond mine turn right.
right.
okay.
ehm now can you go up again about an inch.
uh-huh.
right.
ehm can you see a fast flowing river.
yes.
right.
ehm could you sort of go round that in sort of a curve around the top of that.
in a clockwise direction.
aye.
right.
now keep going down about three inches.
uh-huh.
can you see an apache village.
yes.
eh could you go sort of just at a sort of angle at a right angle down the eh left-hand side of that.
at a r-- moving along to the left first.
well no sort of at an angle a sort of at a.
right.
you know what i mean.
uh-huh.
aye.
eh can you see the carved wooden pole.
no.
right ehm.
you should be at at about a level with the bottom of the apache camp now.
uh-huh.
right.
well just ehm keep heading along about six inches.
to the.
to the left.
to the left.
you see the walled city.
yeah.
just go along the top of that.
past the top of that.
r--.
right.
and now come down past it.
uh-huh.
in sort of a big curve sort of a la-- go d-- go you're heading down now about six inches down but in a sort of curve.
uh-huh.
not a very steep curve just a curve.
a curve to a curve to the right.
aye.
uh-huh.
and then you'll need to be going.
can you see the stone creek.
yes.
so you'll be about three inches from there just now.
uh-huh.
can you sort of oh can you see flat rocks as well.
yes.
right ehm.
can you sort of curve up past stone creek and sort of the curve goes up to the level of the flat rocks.
on the left of the flat rocks.
no.
just underneath them.
you're sort of going past stone creek but your line's curving up past the flat rocks.
right okay.
and then starting to come down again.
got that.
at the far right-hand side of the paper.
right.
can you see the buffalo.
yeah.
just s-- ehm go straight down the side of the paper and past the buffalo on the right-hand side of them.
right.
so that you'll end up underneath the buffalo.
uh-huh.

no.
no right.
ehm.
go along a wee bit underneath the buffalo.
not too far just an inch or something.
uh-huh.
yeah.
and then a small wee blip up like like you're going along the bottom of the paper but sort of a wee curve up the way like there was something in the way.
up and back down again.
yeah.
right.
can you see the fort.
yeah.
right ehm.
you should be just about an inch away from that aye.
almost.
right fine.
ehm now just curve round the fort underneath the fort.
uh-huh.
and end up about an inch up from the fort and an inch along from the fort.
uh-huh.
that's where you finish that's it.
right.
right oh shit right you ready ehm are you there kara.
i'm here.
good.
right.
have have you got a start point.
yeah.
it's it's above uh falls crest falls.
yeah.
mm.
right.
right.
have you got anything to the left of the crest falls.
uh along the bottom of the page there's a banana tree on the far left.
yeah.
right.
well what we need to do is right you start above you start above the falls you drop down the side of the falls go along the bottom round the banana tree and then up.
yeah.
and have you you got a footbridge.
yeah.
and what you do is you go up and then you turn right and go along a couple of inches before you get to the footbridge.
okay.
okay.
right so yo-- and you just like go along as if you're walking across the footbridge th-- the line goes along the footbridge.
okay.
and it immediately drops straight down after that.
okay.
okay.
about an inch.
and there's a p--.
have you got a poisoned stream there.
no.
no right.
well you have to go down about an inch and then along to your right.
and have you got a temple.
yeah.
a good couple of inches to your right.
yeah.
well you go along down and then you curve up just before the seo the old temple.
okay.
right and you go up about an inch above it.
okay.
eh have you got anything to the left of that.
slate mountain.
right.
go up round the top of slate mountain and then down.
okay.
right and.
have you got an abandoned truck.
yeah.
right.
go down underneath the truck and stop just after the truck.
okay.
right after the writing.
right.
have you to the left of that down a bit have you got baboons.
no.
i don't have anything.
right.
well we what we have to do is like draw like a cup shape thing round if you go down about an inch and along about no down about an inch and a half along an inch and a half and then up.
up and then a cup.
an-- in a cul-- in a kind of you know bowl-shaped thing right.
okay.
yeah.
and then you head up.
have you got a white mountain above that.
yeah.
yeah.
right.
if you head up round that.
okay.
up the left-hand side of it and then head straight up about three inches.
okay.
have you got something above that.
a lemon grove.
right.
go round the lemon grove t-- turn to your right.
okay.
okay.
and you got a pyramid.
yeah.
right.
go along up round the outside of the pyramid like up the left-hand side down the right-hand side and along the bottom about a half an inch well just straight underneath the writing where it says pyramid.
okay.
oh and then go left.
yeah.
okay.
so it's you're almost drawing a triangle round it but not quite.
yeah.
right.
underneath that have you got a cobbled street and a remote village.
y-- i just a remote village.
right.
well so we've got something right above there.
right.
okay.
between so what we need to do is come down to the you sort of at a very slight angle to the left.
okay.
you go down right down to the remote village and then curve underneath it and along 'til you get the end of the remote village.
okay.
okay.
right.
that's it.
then that's it.
uh-huh that's it.
right okay ehm right.
have you got a start point right down near the bot-- oh shit down near the bottom of the page which is above a crest falls.
yeah.
right.
the start point's at about a half an inch above it.
yeah.
okay right.
oh right.
what we need to do right is like eh.
above that you've roughly well above and to a wee bit to the left you've got s-- a poison stream is that right.
eh no.
i've got nothing above it i've got an old temple to my right of it.
uh-huh.
have you got anything to-- more to the left at all.
a footbridge quite a bit over.
right okay.
right we need to go t-- right what we need to do is like see the crest falls we need to go like we start just above it and we move to the ehm.
i'll explain it to you right first.
okay.
move to the left about an inch and then drop down like almost at the side of the falls.
right.
it goes into a curve d-- goes along the bottom of the page right to about an inch before the edge of the page and it curves right round it's almost like a kind of square circle and it cuts along and it goes it goes up level with the footbridge and goes along the footbridge.
okay.
goes along the foot bridge to the side of.
yeah.
like as if you're walking along the footbridge.
right.
right okay.
and then it jus--.
what about the banana tree does it come before the banana tree.
oh.
i don't have a banana tree.
right okay.
where's the banana tree roughly.
it's just below the footbridge and along to my left slightly.
in.
right.
it's level with the cr-- the falls.
right okay.
well w-- what we want to kind of go round that the round the outside of that one a massive big curve.
round the outside of it right okay.
okay.
okay.
right.
then back along level with the footbridge.
right you ju-- if you go right to the footbridge.
just sort aye if you if you think.
do you want me to start drawing this or.
just yeah okay.
if its alright right.
right.
down to the side of the crest falls.
right.
just ri-- right down to the bottom of it really.
and then.
right.
along the bottom and then curve up right round past banana tree.
right underneath the footbridge right and along.
right.
right up to the point level with the footbridge.
yeah i'm parallel with the footbridge now.
below it or above it sorry should i be.
eh well you actually need to go across it.
right yeah as if.
oh i'm going along the footbridge.
right sorry okay.
you're walking along it.
is that okay.
yeah sorry.
right see once you've come like if you stop just at the side of the foo-- just at the other edge of the footbridge.
right.
okay.
and we've got a poisoned stream right next to that on the right-hand side.
so we need to drop down about an inch and a half straight down after the footbridge.
straight down.
yeah straight down.
'cause it's right next to it as if we're dropped down between it.
right okay.
okay.
eh drop down about an inch inch and a half.
right.
and then we need to eh go to your your right about two or three inches.
along to the side of the old temple but below it.
yeah now we're.
what's with the old temple right we're going to curve up like ehm curve to go straight up like just before the old temple.
before the old temple.
yeah.
so you're like glancing round it so you just go go in a curve down.
right.
so straight across to the old temple and then up a part.
yeah.
but if you make it a curve instead of like a ti-- a sort of tight angle there.
right okay.
right.
and go about an inch above the old temple just going straight up.
to the side of the straight the slate mountain okay.
yeah.
to the left-hand side of the old temple.
right an inch above it did you say.
okay.
aye about that.
right eh.
there's a kind of hump.
right.
have you got see to the left of where you are right have you got an abandoned truck a good bit to the left.
between th--.
yeah i have.
but before that i've got a slate mountain.
right well.
i've got a massive big hump here so i i presume that goes round the str-- s-- round the top of the slate mountain.
yeah and right.
if you want to draw like draw a curve round the top of the slate mountain and go down underneath the abandoned truck.
far underneath it or just underneath it.
no.
just underneath the writing.
right.
okay and stop just at the end of the writing abandoned truck.
okay.
okay.
right.
have you got down to your bottom left-hand side of where you are a baboons.
no.
i don't have anything.
right okay.
so.
what we oh heck it's right there's a there's this kind of group of baboons right which is right near the edge but we need to kind of go down underneath them and along to about a half an inch before the edge of the page and then up again so it's like a cup-shaped.
thing really.
sorry how far am i going down to.
you're going down about an inch below the abandoned truck.
under.
right see right.
right.
you're underneath the abandoned truck just now.
the truck.
just like a pr--.
is that right.
yeah.
and you need to sort of curve straight down to about an about an inch just over an inch below that and straight down a-- and sort of round along for about an inch and then up for about an inch so it's like a cup-shaped.
along to the end of the page.
to the left.
right.
yeah.
and just before the paper say about a half an inch before the paper curve up again.
right.
okay.
right so.
have you got quite a couple of inches above that a thing called white mountain.
yeah.
right.
now we sort of gently slope to the right from where we are up to the left-hand side of the white mountain so you sort of.
above going above the left of the mountain or underneath it.
no.
just along the side of it along the left-hand side of the mountain.
okay.
and then after you to-- the top of the mountain you go straight up for three inches.
straight up towards the lemon grove.
well i don't have a lemon only.
right we need to avoid that 'cause that's straight above the white mountain it's about two to three inches above it.
right.
well maybe go ab-- right if y-- if you avoid that and once you get to the top of that turn right like a sort of right angle turning to the right if you see what i mean.
okay.
right.
to my right yeah.
uh-huh.
and about two and a half inches along from there th-- have you got a pyramid.
pyramid yeah.
right.
we have to go round the outside of the pyramid but you go up-- up the left-hand side down the right-hand side and underneath it right so we're almost doing a triangle.
up and over right.
but underneath that we've got a cobbled street.
have you got that.
no.
i've got a poisoned stream near there.
oh no like my poisoned stream's a lot more to the right but i've got a cobbled street right underneath the pyramid.
no.
right so.
have you have you drawn round the pyramid yet.
yeah.
i've drawn up above it and then down below again.
right.
if you could go along back to your left right to the end of the pyramid.
back to my left.
yeah.
so it's almost as if you're drawing right round it but not quite.
so like a triangle.
right okay.
yeah uh-huh.
right.
right excuse me coughing right.
we've got have you got a remote village further down.
yeah.
quite a bit down.
right okay now.
what we have to do is sort of veer to the left just a wee bit going straight down so that you come down underneath the remote village right and once you get to the.
you know on the left-hand side of it.
right.
okay.
and then what we need to do is turn turn right straight right f-- just 'til you're other side of the remote village and then that's us done.
right i'm down to the side of it.
underneath the poisoned stream sort of roughly.
well eh mine's is in a different position than yours so.
aye probably if yours is.
so the right-hand side of my right-hand side of the remote village is where we end yeah.
yeah.
but you come round the left-hand side underneath it and along to your right.
yeah.
okay.
so i'm sort of directly above the old temple is where i finish.
yeah.
roughly just yeah say maybe just just short of that.
right okay.
yeah well.
okay.
just short of it okay.
right.
and that's it finished.
yeah.
you put a big cross and your name on it and that.
yes.
right.
go vertically down until you're underneath eh diamond mine.
then eh go right until you're between springbok --boks and highest viewpoint.
where.
right.
right go right.
don't think i've got that on mine.
ah right.
right directly to your right.
right to your right where what is the next obstacle.
ehm quite far over is overgrown gully.
overgrown what.
right so where you've got highest viewpoint is there anything below that.
ehm no.
well i've got overgrown gully.
ah right overgrown gully.
there's no such thing eh on my map.
ehm the next one you've got to go to can you see springboks on yours.
no.
where's that in relation to highest viewpoint.
it's right next to it virtually.
to its right or left.
to its left.
on the same level as highest viewpoint yeah.
just slightly below it.
okay right.
right n--.
go along to your right eh from where you last drew eh in a straight line horizontally.
uh-huh.
and then go up between the the two words springboks and highest viewpoint.
uh-huh.
and then ehm once you then go round the top eh go to your right eh horizontally go.
wh-- wh-- where are you at the moment are you just at s-- springboks here.
well where i think that is.
and the highest viewpoint's above where i am just now.
right okay.
right go vertically up then between the the springboks and highest viewpoint.
okay am i meant to be trying to go under highest viewpoint like under.
no no.
you're meant to be going between eh springboks and highest po-- viewpoint.
okay.
and once you get to above highest viewpoint eh you go horizontally.
above highest viewpoint.
yes.
above highest.
uh-huh.
right then go eh uh to your right horizontally.
then eh come once you're once you've eh passed highest viewpoint eh and there's nothing below you a-- eh apart from safari truck.
if you can see that there.
uh-huh.
right go vertically down to just above s-- eh safari truck.
uh-huh.
right now what you want to do is diagonally eh from eh right to left go eh in front of safari truck.
like coming underneath it.
ehm you go up safari no no i don't mean go underneath it.
go like over it as it were.
uh-huh.
eh right so you're actually going from going diagonally eh from right to left above safari tr-- truck.
oh okay.
right.
to where.
to just ehm below the level of field station.
not got that.
have you got banana tree.
aye the banana tree bu--.
is there a field station there as well.
no nothing there.
oh yeah yes uh-huh.
yeah right.
so i'm going towards field station.
yeah.
go towards field station right.
okay.
until you're eh u-- just underneath the level of the words field station.
okay.
these are identical maps i hope.
right eh right.
then you want to go horizontally eh from eh right to left eh above the banana tree above eh the actual banana tree itself.
i just double back the way.
yes.
like that.
okay.
where to.
right just p-- until you're past banana tree.
okay.
then come vertically down until you come to gold mine.
don't have a gold mine.
you don't have a gold mine.
no.
you must have a gold mine somewhere yeah.
i don't i didn't have that.
is it is it below banana tree.
no.
no.
rock fall i've got.
rock fall.
surely between rock fall and banana tree you've got a gold mine no.
no.
is it is it anywhere at all near.
i've got to the right of banana tree and down there's rope bridge.
eh say that again to the.
to the right of banana tree there's a rope bridge.
right.
now that's slightly down isn't it.
yeah uh-huh.
and eh rock fall is like eh it forms a triangle.
yeah that's right aye.
right.
ehm.
where's your gold mine.
well my gold mine is uh the eh the mid point of the banana tree and rock fall line.
right.
well no i haven't got that.
so you don't have that ehm right.
well mine that must mean that this that you can bypass this obstacle.
so ehm from where you are you're you're you're next to banana tree the word aren't you yeah is that where you are.
i'm above banana tree.
you're certainly above it right.
uh-huh.
okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree.
okay.
now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm.
just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got.
so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down.
from banana tree over to rope bridge.
yeah.
well no no.
no.
just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge.
okay.
right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line.
mmhmm.
it's just slightly below that.
ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there.
sorry say that again.
right.
right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just now.
you're bes-- beside rope bridge.
did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go to.
yes.
i meant to go straight down yeah.
right okay.
i'll just change that.
right.
uh-huh.
right.
so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right.
now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly.
okay.
right.
then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge.
mmhmm.
not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itself.
mmhmm.
and this would be like sort of in the centre of the page.
it's more or less yes in the centre of the page.
roughly okay.
right.
then.
mmhmm.
right n-- from there you want to eh go from left to right across the rope bridge and it's actually ehm if if you think of a d-- it was it's not on the rope bridge the word but the rope bridge itself you want the the the line to pass through the diagram.
uh-huh right.
right.
okay.
right.
now do you have giraffes in eh below rope bridge roughly.
uh-huh.
right.
ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes.
do you s-- do you have crocodiles underneath the rope bridge.
no.
right so there's crocodiles on yours.
ehm there's no crocodiles on mine.
whereabouts are they eh n-- as with respect to the rope bridge.
directly underneath the right-hand side of the rope bridge.
right i see right.
so if there's no obstruction beneath the rope bridge on the other side before you cross it do you think i could go from directly from there to the giraffes.
yeah i s-- i suppose if.
as long as we don't draw over the he-- the crocodiles themselves it'll be okay.
no that that won't that won't affect it.
right okay.
so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page.
from before crossing the rope bridge.
well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right.
but then i can't actually get from the other end of the rope bridge to the giraffes.
oh right.
so they're so they're actually barring that way.
without the crocodiles.
well i imagine so.
less i just drew round them which i suppose i could.
eh can you dr-- actually draw round them.
well yeah i suppose.
well if you could draw round them then.
straight down to the giraffes.
yeah.
just to the left eh t-- sorry to the right of the giraffes in between the the edge of the page and the giraffes.
okay.
right.
now.
you want to go from there eh to your eh left just underneath the giraffes.
now is there any obstacle there.
there's the disused warehouse.
you got that.
disthouse u-- no i don't have that.
it's another obstacle right.
ehm if you can just go round eh above the eh disused warehouse.
and then you want to go eh under the great lake and to the finish.
under the great lake.
yeah.
where's the finish just there.
well the finish is just between rock fall and great lake it's n-- it's not directly between them but it's on the same level as that.
okay.
so that's it finished then.
ehm can you see a caravan park.
your route is to your left of that.
left.
left i think.
i'm going to end up off the paper if i go left.
no.
you have to go round that side though.
oh right right.
going left.
and.
then you go ahead mm you should see an old mill on your left again.
if you're going down if you're going down.
eh no.
aye you forgot to tell me to go down.
no but you go down.
right.
ehm turn to your left.
i can't go left i havenae got to the old mill yet.
no.
you don't go to the old mill.
i can't go any further left i'm right beside the paper.
okay.
from the beginning you go down.
right.
yeah right i've done that.
right.
then you turn left at the bottom of the paper or turn.
so you want me to go right down to the bottom of the paper and then turn left.
mmhmm.
but turn left as if you're walking down.
what.
turn into the paper.
okay.
don't turn off the paper.
right.
okay.
then head along slightly and then turn left again.
have i got left and right mixed up here.
no i haven't.
i can't go any further left i'm right at the left-hand side of the paper right i'm about a centimetre away from it.
oh.
well.
if you can't can't turn left turn right.
right that's a good idea.
yeah.
right.
and then.
when you see the old mill above you.
mmhmm.
turn up the way and you're going past the old mill.
right.
with it on your.
left.
right.
right.
right yes oh yeah.
you've got to go round with it on your right-hand side.
with it on your right-hand side.
yeah.
oh hell back i go right.
right okay.
mmhmm.
now.
you go round the top of the mill.
mmhmm.
and ehm.
he-- continue heading towards your right past the mill.
right.
you should see um a fenced meadow down at the bottom.
aye.
okay.
ehm.
now.
if you're heading along that way turn up left.
you should see an abandoned cottage up the way.
no wait a minute.
do you want me to go past the fenced meadow.
eh.
or just look at it.
don't go near no.
don't go near e-- either of the fenced meadows.
can only see one fenced meadow.
there are two.
there's one above the caravan park and one over from the old mill.
nah.
no it's no on my map.
oh well okay.
there's only the one at there's only the one at the bottom.
oh well right.
right do you want me go along pa-- along like beside the fenced meadow and then go up or do you want me to go up before i get to the fenced meadow.
ehm don't know.
i want you to go up just as you get to the fenced meadow but don't go near it.
okay.
right.
right.
here i am at the abandoned cottage.
you're at the abandoned cottage.
the abandoned cottage is on your left.
is that correct.
yeah.
right okay.
go round the top of the abandoned cottage.
right.
and you come.
oh i'll have to take this off.
right.
you come down slightly to your left if you're heading that way.
but you don't have another fenced meadow.
nope.
nope.
just an empty space.
mm.
okay anyway now.
you should see west lake.
aye.
head up towards west lake.
aye.
now.
when you get there you're going to have to go very close to it but round the side of it.
right.
which which way round the side clockwise or anticlockwise.
erm towards towards the trig point.
do you see that.
the what.
the trig point.
what's a trig point.
can you see a trig point.
i don't know what a trig point is.
there should should be marked on your map.
is it not.
what something with trig point written beside it.
yeah.
yeah.
nope.
it's near the lake.
it's not.
nope.
okay.
you have to go round.
clock well just say clockwise or anticlockwise.
anticlockwise.
anticlockwise.
anticlockwise.
on the the right-hand side of the lake.
right.
okay.
and i have to go right round.
no no.
right.
right.
where do i stop then.
see when it starts turning up to the left.
you turn to the right.
you know what i mean.
eh like.
you go round the side of the lake.
like there's t-- like there's two rabbit ears.
and when you get to the one on the.
yeah.
right you have to start going right.
yes.
yeah.
right i think so aye right.
you go right.
right.
okay.
now.
you have to go back down the way near the abandoned cottage again don't cross the pass path that you've been on already.
right.
do i just follow that path though.
ehm well you shouldn't be near the path really.
you have to go down to that level again you know back to the the stage of the abandoned cottage.
right.
can you see a monument.
aye.
right.
you have to go round the monument with it on your ehm left-hand side.
right.
okay.
so you've got the monument enclosed in your path.
well sort of aye.
yeah.
okay now.
you see a nuclear test site.
nope.
you don't oh dear.
ehm okay.
continue go round the monument.
mmhmm.
until almost the top of his head.
until.
oh sh-- i've gone past that right.
have you gone past it.
so you should have like a semicircle round the monument.
aye.
right now.
you have to veer slightly to your left.
left.
right.
just slightly.
right.
and then.
go up straight up towards east lake.
right.
uh-huh.
now.
sticking quite close to east lake.
right.
can you see the finish.
yeah.
no.
i i don't think i've got a finish on mine.
you don't have a finish.
can you see farmed land.
aye.
well.
stick closely to east lake it's on your right-hand side and just go past the bit that's jutting out.
hang on.
you want me to go round the right-hand side of east lake.
no i want you to go left but the east lake should be on your right-hand side.
oh right aye.
okay.
aye.
now.
just where it turns up just carry on the path you are for a few more steps and you should be finished.
uh-huh.
right.
should have come to the finish.
i think so.
yeah.
"looks like your route home from the ""q"" ""m"" on a thursday night."
that's that i think then.
yeah.
go.
okay we're going to start above th-- directly above the telephone kiosk.
okay.
do you have that.
i've got the start yeah.
okay.
you're going to move around the left of the telephone kiosk the same distance as you are above it.
you're about what half an inch above it.
uh-huh.
okay.
downwards.
downwards sort of skipping.
to the left-hand side.
yeah.
down until you're about an inch from the bottom of the page you should be skipping the edge of the page by about half an inch.
okay.
okay.
now take it do you have a stone circle at the bottom.
no.
no you don't.
okay.
now are you like if you come in a wee bit so that you're about an inch away from both edges.
okay.
okay.
if you get to that point.
okay.
now move along about an inch.
to the right.
to the right.
directly horizontally across.
okay.
okay.
now curve up and out a wee bit and then straight up.
up and up and left or right.
so that you're.
see where your farmer's gate is.
right.
okay.
we're going to come up on the left-hand side of that you'll just skim it by about a centimetre.
okay.
up and to the right.
up to the left-hand side of it yeah until you're at the top left-hand corner of the drawing.
of the broken gate.
of the broken gate that's correct.
okay.
okay.
now.
you're going to move right.
you know where the meadow is in the bottom right-hand corner.
yeah.
okay.
see the third seagull along.
yeah.
okay.
now go upwards until you're level with the point you're at at the f-- the broken gate.
sorry have i to go round the top of it.
no no.
don't don't draw anything yet.
just like say with your finger an imaginary point.
above the third seagull.
above the seagull so that both like your pen.
and your finger are level.
okay.
right.
okay.
okay.
now if you raise your right this imaginary point up about three quarters of an inch say.
okay.
okay.
see the point you're at there.
draw a diagonal line linking these two points.
okay.
right.
okay.
now.
do you have a ruined monastery.
eh not near where i am just now.
it's in the middle of the page.
yeah.
right up at the middle of the page.
yeah.
okay.
now if you say put make a point that that's just off the top right-hand turret or whatever it is you know just the top right-hand edge of that.
okay yeah.
it's about a centimetre off it.
okay.
okay.
if you draw a kind of diagonal line curving yourself.
round the monastery down to where i was.
eh just from that edge to where you were.
right okay.
do you have the overnight accommodation.
no.
but you can go through that.
okay.
okay okay.
okay.
right.
now do you have the west lake down to your left.
no.
okay.
right if you draw like a curved arch from the point you're at eh over the top of the the ruins.
right.
okay.
back down to like say a point that's level only on the other side.
okay.
right.
right.
what you're going to do is you're going to continue your downward line for about another inch moving down towards let me see in a compass direction it would be southwest.
right just continue down the way.
right.
okay.
moving both outwards and downwards.
right.
okay.
now skim a line that's pointing diagonally up if you take a point about an inch and a half from the edge of the page.
level with where i am.
level from where you are.
okay.
okay.
then move that point up half an inch so you've got a kind of diagonal line again.
right.
okay this is the left-hand edge of the page yeah.
yeah okay.
okay.
if you connect these two points.
okay.
do you have a stile above you.
yeah.
okay.
are you downwards and slightly to the left of the stile.
i'm down and about an inch to the left.
an inch to the okay.
you could come in a wee bit so that when you go up you uh you go up to the top left-hand corner of the stile but you're only say about a centimetre from the edge so that's your line.
okay.
your point should be downwards you probably got the distance correct down the way but that'll be your route.
up to the top of the stile.
yeah.
top left-hand corner.
okay.
now if you like sort of draw a line along the top of that as if we're skirting round the ex-- the edge of it.
okay.
again now we're going to move straight up about an inch and a half.
from the right-hand corner of the stile.
i've.
uh-huh.
do you have an obstacle there.
i've got a popular tourist spot slightly to the right and up from the stile.
okay.
now we go up.
right so you're at a point that's probably about two to three inches away from both the top edge and the left-hand side edge is that correct.
no not at the moment.
no.
right can you see that point well if you imagine a point.
up in the top left-hand corner.
right the top left-hand corner.
if you come down about three inches.
aye right okay.
okay.
i've got i've got.
and you come in about three inches okay there's a point.
i've got a great viewpoint there.
oh wait a minute.
okay.
no no.
i've got a great viewpoint away up in the top left-hand corner.
yeah.
that's what i thought you were talking about.
no.
if you diagonally if you came in the same distance again.
do you get it sh--.
oh wait a minute what would that be hold on.
one two three say four inches ac-- in fact chris.
okay.
four inches away from the top edge four inches away from the the edge on the left-hand side.
right.
now on my map that should be that's like up from the stile.
right.
okay.
now if you're at that point do you have a a dead tree it's an elm tree down to your.
yeah.
right over the other side of the page.
okay.
"now see there the letter ""d""."
mmhmm.
that one oh i've got dead tree you've got elm tree.
i've got dutch elm.
is it.
dutch elm.
is it written underneath the tree.
yeah.
okay.
see the first letter of dutch say.
mmhmm.
okay about a centimetre below that.
right.
okay if you draw a line is that a can you ha-- have a diagonal line going from where you are right down to.
yeah.
yeah.
do you go through anything.
no.
okay.
see the popular viewpoint what happened to it did we go round it or what.
no we just stayed away from it.
oh never went anywhere near it.
no w-- well we went round the popular tourist spot we avoided the great viewpoint.
yeah okay went round that that's fine.
okay you're going to curve half a circle around that tree.
up the way.
up the way.
so that.
see the third branch from the left.
uh-huh.
until you're say above that that's your half circle.
okay.
"okay you've done a ""u"" turn."
now.
if you draw like a kind.
let's see.
see where you have the east lake at the top.
yeah.
"right if you draw a line if you go from the ""e"" in lake down the way."
okay.
okay.
on to the edge of the lake.
right.
and then say about half a centimetre from the edge of the lake if you connect those two points.
okay.
now skirt the edge of the lake to the left move left along the edge of the lake.
okay.
for about three inches.
to the corner.
yeah to the corner.
so you're just past go past that co-- don't go up or anything like that just go past the corner for about an inch.
okay.
right.
right.
and finish there.
you.
okay.
right.
go up.
have you got the sandy shore.
right.
you've got the start.
mmhmm.
now.
do you have a well.
no.
no right okay.
do you have like.
right.
you've got crane bay.
mmhmm.
so follow crane bay down for about three centimetres.
right.
then.
just like at the tip of crane bay the bottom tip at the left-hand side you're there's a well.
mmhmm.
so you want to go like round the well.
to the left or the right.
the left.
left.
so i go down to the tip and then turn.
no.
stay about two centimetres off the tip and then curve round to the left and down.
right.
so i'm going over the bay.
mm.
no.
you're still on land.
oh the left the left sorry yes.
the left right okay.
left.
okay.
and down.
and down.
and then have you got the houses of local residents.
ehm yes.
right.
go along 'til you're about just before it in line with the bottom of it.
er right.
right now.
do you have a bridge.
yes.
right.
you're going up and cross the bridge.
okey-dokey.
and.
keep going across for about five six centimetres.
right.
is the woodland there is it.
yes.
you're about three centimetres away from the wood.
right.
right.
now you want to.
got the forked stream.
yes.
there's a stream with a fork.
right mmhmm.
now.
continue from where you are down you're going to be going like slightly southeast 'til you get to the f-- 'til you touch the forked stream and then curve round with the forked stream.
right.
'til the top 'til you get to the top of the fork.
right.
now.
have you got a dead tree.
mmhmm.
you do you have farmed land.
erm.
to the right.
well my farmed land's right down the bottom of the the page.
no right okay.
where the dead tree is on the other side of the stream there's farmed land.
so.
where you are just now go right for about f-- six centimetres.
right.
and then down 'til you're in level line with the bottom of the dead tree.
right.
and then cut across 'til you're right below the dead tree.
right.
i have to jump a stream.
sort of i suppose that's alright.
yeah.
mmhmm that's okay.
there's no bridge here either.
right now.
do you have a lagoon.
yes.
right.
from where you are go straight down for about five centimetres.
ehm i've got buried treasure down there.
do you.
mmhmm.
eh whereabouts is the buried treasure.
eh it's just sort of parallel to the top of the lagoon.
right okay.
go down to like in line with where it actually says lagoon.
right.
will that miss the buried treasure.
yeah.
right.
that's fine then.
and then go str-- left.
mmhmm.
'til you reach the lagoon and then down to the bottom of the lagoon follow it round.
right.
right now.
you got green bay.
mmhmm.
ehm.
right.
you're heading for the edge of green bay the land of the top left one.
mmhmm.
bit point of land.
but there's a rock fall above green bay.
right.
like where the wee dent is.
see the dent.
mmhmm.
so that's goes from about three centimetres up.
so if you go from the tip of lagoon to the tip of green bay sort of avoiding the rock fall.
mmhmm.
so where's the rock fall is it.
right.
see the like the wee curvy bit in green bay.
mmhmm.
the top.
mmhmm.
the rock fall takes up about three centimetres round there.
so if i go further over to the left then i'll miss it.
yeah mmhmm.
right.
go left and then go down.
okay.
to the point.
right.
and then.
have you got the pirate ship.
mmhmm.
just curve from the point go right go down and curve into the right 'til you reach the tip of the pirate ship.
so across the bay.
yeah through the water.
so i just go straight down.
straight down.
and curve to the right 'til you're in line with the pirate ship.
right pirate ship.
right okay.
and that's you finished.
okay.
right.
right.
right.
see the diamond mine up there.
mmhmm.
right well.
see we just go to the top left of it just sort of near the sort of square on its end right.
right.
at the diamond mine right.
right.
right.
just sort of up to the top left of that you start up there.
right.
right.
just right next to the diamond mi-- mine.
right.
there's a big cross right.
is there a cross there.
aye.
oh right.
so you just go down the diamond mine.
right.
down.
just down ss--.
and follow it round it's sort of a square round the diamond mine.
what draw a l-- a line round the diamond.
just sort of head it down.
right.
from the the the cross right.
right.
you go straight down.
right.
to level with the sort of diamond mine writing.
right.
right in there when you're just below it just go right over to your right.
right.
and then stop under springboks.
right.
springboks.
springboks.
there's no that's not on the map.
well what's on your map.
yeah well if i go right over to the right i'm on the.
over aye.
is there anything on your map.
what does it say.
overgrown gully.
oh right i understand this now.
well go over about sort of eh oh just over half the pa-- un-- just under half the width of the paper from the diamond mine.
right.
right.
then stop.
and then sort of go up.
how far.
eh sort of near the top of the page.
then stop.
and then go over to your right.
right.
highest viewpoint.
right you're you're just should just be above that.
right keep going right stop stop.
then go down.
this is ridiculous.
go down about oh it's.
to the overgrown gully.
christ almighty.
mm.
just oh see that's no on mine.
just go down about oh three inches.
that's me in overgrown gully then.
oh so i go down to the sort of eh southwest right that sort of direction just go.
that's not on mine.
have i to avoid the overgrown gully.
just keep going.
that's not on mine.
just go.
right southwest.
right.
about a good wee bit.
and you should be sort of like a third down the paper by now are you.
mm mmhmm.
mmhmm.
and then go left.
straight left like.
aye.
just sort of straight left.
so where do i.
so you should be about oh two inches off the left of the paper.
right.
right.
and then go down.
straight down.
aye straight down.
about a third to the height of the paper.
so i'm two thirds of the way down now.
smashing.
and then go to the right just a wee shade about w-- one inch an in-- inch and a half stop an inch and a half and then sort of go northeast a wee bit.
i overdid it a wee bit there.

right.
mm.
and then go down about half an inch.

right.
you're we you're going to end up in a line with the bottom of the ravine.
right.
right.
underneath the start point.
right.
right.
under the start point but on the same line as the ravine bottom of the ravine.
right.
right.
right.
if you could sort of curve round.
mmhmm.
so that you're vertically underneath the start point.
oh jeez.
missing.
is it is that where your carpenter's cottage is underneath the burnt forest.
right.
a--.
aye.
it's just directly underneath there.
well if you go to the.
to the left of that.
to the left of that.

right.
just to the right of it.
yeah so.
well i'll just go straight down there.
well aye.
if you sort of miss out the r-- go round the avalanche.
right i will.
which i presume and you should be at the right of the concealed hideout.
right.
i'm at the right of it.
right.

right ehm.
you've got to take your line down from the start to just vertically to just to the left of burnt forest.
to the left of burnt forest.
mmhmm.
so it's not far down.
no.
it's a tiny bit.
okay and while you're doing that go in to your right a bit but it doesn't really matter.
okay ehm.
have you got a ravine.

mmhmm.
right next to it.
is there a space between them yeah.
mmhmm.
right take the line and go to your right underneath the cottage.
can you do that.
no.
'cause the ravine's on the right of the cottage.
yeah.
but i want you to draw up through between the cottage and the ravine.
and down through.
no.
up through go g--.

i've just come down there.
you weren't meant to.
right.
okay right.
you went down past burnt forest.
i went underneath burnt forest.
well.
you weren't meant to.
well you said draw round the cottage.
okay right.
you're meant to come down from the start.
mmhmm.
vertically right past burnt forest.
mmhmm.
keep drawing vertically.
oh right down past the carpenter's cottage.

and then go right.
then go right underneath the cottage.
uh-huh.
go up through between the cottage and the ravine 'til you get t-- to stop just above the ravine.
uh-huh.
and do you have a remote village.

okay.
right of the burnt forest.
uh-huh.
and that's just situated above the ravine.
uh-huh.
okay.
so i want you to imagine i want you to imagine that the remote village is there just to the right of the burnt forest right so it's kind of like in a triangle.
right.
so draw your line to the right horizontally above the ravine okay.
then do you have a pine forest.
a pine grove.
a pine grove uh-huh.
uh-huh.
i want you to draw the line keep going to your right okay so you're sort of like drawing towards the top of the pine grove then stop and go from left to right in a diagonal underneath the pine grove.
a diagonal.
from from the top of the ravine to underneath the pine grove.
so it's like diagonally down.
uh-huh.
okay and then.

down to the concealed hideout.
not co-- not completely down.
just get past the avalanche right.
past the avalanche.
and then ehm eventually i want you to go round concealed hideout.
right.
okay.
wh-- what do you mean round.
to.
to the right of concealed hideout.
so right over to the end of the page.
uh-huh.
and i want you to draw underneath concealed hideout stop just underneath concealed bit there.
okay are you there.
mmhmm.
right.
do you have a boat house to your left.
right at the bottom.
oh do you not have another one to your right of the concealed hideout.
yeah right of the concealed hideout uh-huh.
draw to just before the boat house writing starts there right okay that's where i want you to be.
what from the concealed hideout to the boat house.
uh-huh.
so would it bypass the river.
yeah.
i don't want you to go near the river at all.
but i have to go near it to go to the boat house.
no i want you to go to the boat house on your right on your on your left.
i don't have one on my left.
thought you did.
got one underneath the concealed hideout.
well i've got one i've got one to the left of the concealed hideout.
what the other side of the page.
uh-huh.
oh no mine's is underneath the concealed hideout.
have you drawn down to there.
no.
good.
right imagine you've got a boat house to the left of the concealed hideout.
right.
do you see where in can you see crane bay.
mmhmm.
do you see where there's where the coastline comes round it's um there's a sort of like jutting out bit there's like a point.
yeah.

mmhmm.
or just to the right of it.
okay.
i want you to.
you see where it comes down like that.
mmhmm.
well i want you to follow follow the line of the coa-- the coast there.
so draw from concealed hideout vertically downwards 'til you come to that jutting out bit of the coastline then until until on that incline draw you know follow the line of the coast but don't don't go on to crane bay until you come to the the next bit that comes up okay stop there.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
right do you have ehm coconut palm to your left.
no.
no.
do you have pebbled shore.
mmhmm.
well i want you to draw.
uh i've got pebbled shore and above that i've got coconut palm.
mmhmm.
right.
so imagine you've got a tree there and i want you to draw between where that tree would be where the pebbled shore is so just keep drawing go make your line go down a bit right and just to come to above pebbled shore and just stop the end there.
and then ehm i don't suppose you've got finished marked on your map no.
right.
have you got anything below pebbled shore.
washed stones.
well.
and flagship and bay.
right see wh-- see where the flagship is.
mmhmm.

and see where the pebbled shore is.
mmhmm.
imagine a a triangle with ehm an equilateral triangle with the pebbled shore flagship and finish.
right can you s--.
mmhmm.
yeah.
sort of see where that is.
right.
imagine the finish is there.
draw roughly down to there.
ehm bypassing pebbled shore.
it would be just just.
near mmhmm.
but you just right near the end of the page.
so i just go down to the right of pebbled shore.
yeah uh-huh.
uh-huh.
and down like.
no no not to the right.
the right as you face the map.
no.
well what side then.
the left.
you've dr-- you've drawn above t-- pebbled shore.

to the end of the page.
mmhmm.
right quite far down.
and then down.
and then.
but then i've got washed stones there.

well that's okay.
just draw round it and past it.
to the left yeah.
yeah.
and then that's the finish.
and then the finish is just ehm on a horizontal with the flagship near to the coast about a centimetre away from the coast.

mmhmm.
right there.
okay.
okay.
is that just beside the flagship yeah.
mmhmm.
okay.
i bet they're totally different.

uh-huh.
and then turn l-- go down the way and sort of skim along the p-- the side of the page okay for about f-- five inches.
h--.
y-- i know there's nothing there but on my map there's a picnic site which you have to try and avoid.
okay.
right so.

right.
and stop just above the climbing frame.
look oh right okay.

i was wanting for a separate climbing frame.
certainly different.
right so you're sort of in the l-- top left-hand corner of the adventure playground of the climbing frame right.
yeah.
right.
from then on i want you to go sort of horizontally along sort of s-- just a couple of millimetres above.
millimetres.
no.
above the adventure playground.
right okay.
right.
go to your right for about wait a minute seven inches maybe horizontally along.

right.
the cavalry place is sort of just just down below that.
below the trout farm.
yeah just.
there's absolutely nothing in my.
right.
it's just directly below that anyway.
right.
i'll just sort of come up 'til i'm directly below the trout farm.
the trout farm.
right.
right.
go back along towards the left.
right.
just below the trout farm.
to yo-- to you--.
oh i'll just go to the left i don't care if it's your left or my left.
right.
well it's my left anyway.
start to slowly walk go down the way.
have you got a picture of a great rock.
uh-huh.
yeah it's just.
come down 'til you're about ehm two in-- two to three inches above that.
right.
okay.
right.
"ehm go along to like level with the ""b"" from the bandit territory."
okay.
if you know what i mean if you just walk up.
and then start going back up the way again to the outside of a gold mine.
have you got a gold mine.
i've got a to-- i've got.
right.
i've came down to an inch ab-- two inches above the great rock right.
right.
to the right of the great rock.
and then above the great rock i've got a totem pole and then i've got a gold mine.
right.
go right up to like beside the gold mine.
right.
"but see what about the ""b"" what did you say about the ""b"" in the bandit territory."
sort of curved out the way.
i just meant like that was how far out you were to go to.
oh above the great rock.
yeah.
right okay.
okay.
right.
and then right up to the gold mine.
u-- up to the gold mine.
to the left or to the right.
well.
once you get to the gold mine you start going to m-- my right.
and you've got another great rock.
i haven't.
have you got the indian country.
uh-huh.
right.
it's sort of away over to the right-hand side.
uh-huh.
right.
when you get to the gold mine start going down a bit.
mmhmm.
right.
well i've come up to the sort of bottom left-hand corner of the gold mine right.
right you're.
go above the gold mine above the little dr-- drawing bits of the gold mine.
right okay.
right.
to the and then along to the indian country which is below it.
yeah.
go down the way so that you miss the great rock.
right.
and then back up above the tote-- above the wigwams.
of the indian country.
o-- of the indian country.
right.
go above them.
right.
then go up.
have you got the carved stones.
i've got an indian country then a ravine.
and then the carved stones.
well avoid the ravine.
right.
and go ehm above the indian s-- above the carved stones sorry.
right.
right.
go round and above them heading back to the left again.
right.
do you have a graveyard.
nope.
no.
what do you have there.
i've got the carved stones and then a diamond mine.
right.
like towards the.
come down just after the carved stones.
right.
to the left of the carved stones right.
to the left of the carved stones.
and then sort of go back a bit to the right.
and you're sort of undernea--.
back up.
back towards the right.
towards the ravine.
curve round to.
yeah well try and avoid the ravine.
right okay.
right.
and well the graveyard's here.
so do you have gallows.
right.
uh-huh.
they're sort of away over to the left hand side.
yeah.
okay.
well say about ehm a centimetre above them.
mmhmm.
go underneath like where the graveyard is to the diamond mine straight along to the diamond right mine.
okay.
right.
by the way i started at the finish instead of at the start i've just realised that.
i know.
'cause i was just aye just about a couple of minutes ago i saw the start thing.
yeah snap.
who cares.
anyway and then like after the diamond mine cut up on the left-hand side of it up to the start.
uh-huh.
different.
oh no.
well we did it reversed.
so we should have started there.
yeah.
doesn't matter.
well we did it the wrong way round but.
start top of the extinct volcano.
it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map.
oh.
but it's marked well.
okay.
i was looking at the top.
have you found it.
yeah it's okay.
right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left.
mmhmm.
and stop.
is that horizontally.
horizontally yeah sorry.
okay.
and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it.
pen's not working there that's done it okay.
and stop about you're there.
then you go horizontally left.
have you got a tribal settlement.
no.
that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map.
mm.
it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side.
so you go from that point where you stopped.
okay.
mmhmm.
along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge.
just in a horizontal line.
horizontal line straight across.
okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement.
well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it.
uh-huh.
you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement.
okay.
how far away from the edge of the paper.
one and a half centimetres.
okay.
stop.
just get my ruler out.
have you got a rope bridge.
yeah.
if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge.
you know what i mean.
mmhmm.
so.
okay.
so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper.
upwards for about.
the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge.
yeah.
un--.
no.
'til you've f-- maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round.
below the writing of rope bridge.
no.
below.
below.
do you ha-- the left-hand side of the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge.
okay.
so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah.
yes you cro--.
okay.
are you crossing the rope bridge.
you want me to cross it uh-huh.
well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge.
okay.
and then stop when you get to the other side.
uh-huh.
because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide cur-- curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres.
mmhmm.
so.
do you have a machete.
instead.
no i don't.
where's the machete.
it's to the right and just down.
from the rope bridge.
it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge.
so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay.
is that curving down a lot.
'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down.
mmhmm.
well where would i go once i curve down on your map.
you turn right and go straight across so you're th-- you're about three centimetres above the start position.
okay that's fine.
i'll just go underneath it then.
and stop when you're you're.
have you got a collapsed shelter.
uh-huh.
just above there.
yeah.
so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh.
about two centimetr-- me-- --metres underneath it.
that's fine.
have you got a saxon barn.
uh-huh.
well you go straight up from that point where you were.
mm.
past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter.
just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn.
mmhmm.
so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left.
and stop there.
no.
straight line up to s-- the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map.
so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the.
no.
straight line upwards.
well i can't do that.
why not.
'cause my saxon barn's on the.
no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter.
uh-huh.
you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it.
oh okay.
have you got a crevasse.
no.
well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn.
no.
so if you go straight up would you c-- curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn.
if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up.
would that be okay.
if you go well i was going.
so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah.
but the the top of it.
okay.
just a bit above.
and you go straight up and curve round and then down and underneath the saxon barn.
say that again.
i'm on just now i'm on a horizontal line just beside above the saxon barn.
but not right over it.
no.
i'm not beside it yet.
no right.
ehm so you would.
ehm is where's the crevasse from there is it underneath you.
it's just beside me just now it's just to my right like if i if i went sorry if i went to my left i would pass the crevasse and i would pass the saxon barn.
right.
so if you go over the top of the crevasse and down the side of it then underneath the saxon barn.
could you do that.
you want me to draw underneath the saxon barn.
yes.
uh-huh okay.
where will i stop.
"and stop ehm beside the ""s""."
of saxon.
saxon.
okay.
and have you got pelicans.
no.
no.
ehm go down about three to four centimetres from the saxon barn vertically downwards.
so i'm above the rope bridge.
just a bit above the rope bridge yeah.
okay.
the end of it.
uh-huh.
and then go underneath where i've got pelicans towards the left-hand side.
mmhmm.
is that just beside the edge of the paper uh-huh.
uh-huh.
about a centimetre away from it.
okay.
stop.
have you got a white mountain.
uh-huh.
go straight up from there ehm slightly curving a bit round the white mountain.
over the top of it uh-huh.
no.
don't go over it g-- stop when you're parallel to the top of the white mountain.
okay mmhmm.
and have you got a golden beach at the top left-hand corner.
yeah.
go up to go straight up from the top of the white mountain to the edge of the golden beach.
okay.
have you got secret valley or submerged rocks.
yes.
so i've got secret valley.
okay.
so you want me to go above secret valley.
nowhere ne--.
nowhere near secret valley.
what.
have you have you your golden beach is it at the top left-hand corner or the right-hand corner.
top right-hand corner.
oh well.
there's one at the top left-hand corner of this map as well.
oh okay.
so you're at the top of the white mountain just now.
mmhmm.
go straight up five or six centimetres and stop.
right i'm meant to be right on top of white mountain just well just beside the top yeah.
well yes parallel to it uh-huh.
so okay.
straight up.
stop.
have you got slate mountain.
yeah.
go directly along from that point to the end of slate mountain.
to the right-hand end of the slate mountain.
uh-huh left-hand end of slate slate mountain 'cause you go over the top of it.
okay.
so just do that then go rou--.
whe-- where's the golden beach i've got to avoid is that like above.
that's in the top left-hand corner yeah.
okay okay.
right.
kind of are you over the mountain.
you want me to go over it.
"just go over it and stop at the other side and curve right round underneath it so that you're about a centimetre underneath the ""s""."
mmhmm.
and you got a secret valley.
yeah.
can you go d-- v-- down from there down the left-hand side of the secret valley.
mmhmm.
and are you underneath the secret valley.
hold on you want me to be underneath the secret valley.
"go draw a straight line to the end of just about a centimetre away from the ""y"" and that's the finish."
underneath it.
"underneath the ""y"" of secret valley."
"a centimetre down from the ""y"" yeah."
mmhmm.
okay.
that's it.
okay.
you're going to go down slightly to the right just slightly in sort of ehm in a curve shape an outward curve curve shape from the cliffs.
mm.
okay.
now.
where do i go from the start.
right.
you're going to go down.
right.
uh-huh.
but just slightly down and slightly to the right.
uh-huh.
so i go underneath the cliffs.
so you're get going to get a curve shape.
uh-huh a--.
uh-huh.
curve at the cliffs.
yeah.
right.
right.
have you got a forge.
ehm no.
no.
no.
right.
come to the left.
right.
so i go underneath the cliffs.
no don't go underneath the cliffs.
no.
no.
right.
no no no.
"it's like a backward ""s"" shape you're forming."
mm yeah think i know.
right.
yeah okay.
so.
"at at the bottom of the sort of backward ""s""."
have you got that far.
i don't know.
right okay right.
from the start you're going to go down slightly to the right and form a curve an outward curve.
to the right to the right okay.
okay.
thanks.
and then.
you're going to do the opposite of that you're going to go out.
further to the left.
mm.
yeah.
now.
i've got an old pine here.
come back an old pine an old pine.
what do i do in relation to it.
oh and you don't have it.
right ehm.
is the old pine at the the bottom of the curve or sort of next to it.
the old pine is ehm underneath and.
underneath the curve.
to the to the right of the cliffs.
really ehm.
right okay.
forget the old pine.
okay.
well you're going to go round the old pine.
right.
right.
am i.
right.
but.
ah.
go round the old pine.
mmhmm.
okay.
wh-- right.
what am i going above it or what.
above it.
above it.
straight above it right.
right.
okay.
go slightly.
let me see.
ehm going to go to the left go slightly to the left and you're going to curve down just a slightly go about f-- about ehm five centimetres.
now where am i now.
right.
don't know where i am.
go five centimetres.
are you near a pine forest.
eh yeah i can see.
the pine forest.
right.
right.
go sort of like slightly just parallel to the pine forest but about three centimetres out from it.
mm.
so i go over to the pine forest and then go down.
no no no right.
no.
right.
go to the point where you're.
see the top of the pine forest.
uh-huh.
the top of it right.
yeah.
you're going to go to the left right you should be at the left of it right and paralle-- parallel to it.
mmhmm.
right.
yeah.
are you there.
ehm think so.
okay.
right.
ehm.
oh dear.
right.
ca-- you're going to slope down and it's going to be.
oh let me see how i could explain that.
at about five o--.
say how like at five o'clock you'll have a small hand with the small hand sort of like darting down towards the five.
mmhmm.
right.
go down that that way to the bottom of pine forest at a slant.
right.
right.
uh-huh yeah.
right now.
okay.
you're going to form another outward curve like half a circle.
mmhmm.
just do sort of like a small half circle to your sort of like ehm a quarter down the page.
mmhmm.
so where am i heading.
right are you ne-- a--.
right.
are y-- you near a bakery.
eh yeah.
right.
go right round that bakery.
round the bakery mm.
round the bakery.
god.
what way.
ehm go out out out the way.
out the way so.
towards the towards the th-- ehm the edge of the page.
mm oh dear.
right.
have you got a forest stream.
no.
no.
right.
right.
what about wheatfields.
i have wheatfields right.
right the way over.
yeah now.
where am i going in relation to them.
should be nowhere near them.
yeah.
well i'm not so far.
have you.
have you got a canal.
no.
but i've got a forest stream.
now right.
you're round the bakery you're round the bakery aren't you.
no.
because i've got a forest stream in the way oh my good god.
so.
you can't go round the bakery.
ehm i'll make my way round the stream here oh dear.
right.
right i think so.
go round the bakery.
mm.
right round it and just pass i-- pass it erm a small fraction.
mmhmm.
as well.
right.
right.
you're going to go straight down this time for about four centimetres.
mmhmm.
right.
yeah.
you're going to form another slight curve ehm another circle but you're going to do it ehm ehm convex towards the page like outward an outward you're forming the outward ehm form of a circle here a minute.
no mmhmm.
right.
go go ehm three centimetres to the left again no wait a minute where are we three centimetres to the right.
i'm going to go off the edge of the page here.
right are you near wheatfields.
no.
no right.
go back 'til you're sort of like middle of the page right.
right mm.
but down slightly but you're sort of still in the middle of the page.
are you near crane bay.
mm yeah.
right.
right.
what do i do there.
right.
see the second peak of crane bay.
uh-huh.
that's where you should be.
no.
i'm not there.
right.
retrace all your steps and go go to there.
right.
forget that.
right now.
is is there wheatfields near.
er right wait a minute.
i go round the the far side of the bakery and then head towards the s-- second peak of crane bay.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
shi-- right sort of trace that sort of ehm bevelled shape in crane crane bay and you want to get to the second peak of crane bay.
right.
eh yeah i think so i'm getting there.
the one that's towards the right.
yeah.
okay.
right.
follow that curve of crane bay down for about three centimetres.
mmhmm.
are you near wheatfields.
no.
my wheatfields are on the middle of the page.
no.
that's that's okay that's okay right.
go go along for another three centimetres.
have you got a rocket warehouse.
uh-huh.
now.
where am i supposed to be.
right.
you're supposed to be just above the rocket warehouse.
just above it.
right.
right.
so i go down and then along.
right i go down from crane bay.
uh-huh.
and then across.
just you should be just above rocket warehouse.
yeah.
right.
uh-huh think so.
right.
head t-- down towards your right at a slant.
mmhmm.
right.
yeah.
and then.
you should be near enough at the edge of the page.
erm oh dear oh dear.
ehm oh dear ehm.
you're about an in--.
i'm still at the left of the rocket warehouse.
right.
you're at the left of the rocket ehm rocket warehouse.
uh-huh.
i'm above.
above.
and at the left of the rocket warehouse.
above.
right.
go straight down to a slant 'til you're near enough just a centimetre away from the edge of the page.
mm right okay.
okay.
hope so.
go down by another three centimetres.
oh.
and then.
tutu.
ehm.
trying to think.
have you got an old lighthouse.
yeah.
and a cave.
well.
you're heading towards the old lighthouse that's where you should be now.
right.
ehm yeah that's where i'm going.
so what do i do then.
that's it that's it.
that's it.
and i go to the old lighthouse.
yep.
right.
right er.
the start is above an extinct volcano.
do you have that on your map.
uh-huh right i've got that right.
okay.
and about one and a half centimetres above the peak of the extinct volcano.
straight up the way.
is the start yeah you got that on your map okay.
yeah i've got that.
a big cross right.
and go four centimetres along to your left.
right.
and slope.
no it doesn't matt--.
erm about.
six centimetres down.
straight down.
yeah straight down.
how far up from the bottom of the page then.
erm er you should be about three centimetres above the bottom of the page.
right.
and do you have a tribal settlement.
no you don't.
erm thr--.
go along to your left until you're directly under the rope bridge.
right.
okay.
and go along four centimetres to your left again.
right.
er up vertically seven centimetres just straight up.
and curve to your right until you go across the rope bridge.
and go across the rope bridge er stop at the end.
c-- eh curve down going right again er go down by about three centimetres.
do you have an obstacle near you.
there's a machete.
a machete.
are we just underneath --neath it.
right.
will we hit it if we go along.
no.
i'm just underneath it.
no just underneath it.
well.
go along seven centimetres.
to the right.
to the right yeah.
and do you have a collapsed shelter yeah.
mmhmm.
are you to the left of that just.
er right.
right.
just to the left of that.
and go directly up about ten centimetres.
to about halfway up the page.
yeah.
er do you have an obstacle.
there's a crevasse to the left.
a crevasse.
well.
curve round above the crevasse then and.
how far over now.
erm just stop just when you're just above the left of the crevasse.
and er there's forty-five degree slope.
do you have a saxon barn.
mmhmm.
er slope underneath it from the top of the crevasse.
down towards that.
right.
to just underneath the right-hand side of the saxon barn and go along three centimetres under the saxon barn.
and do you have pelicans.
right.
no.
"""p"" for pink erm."
go down and along well this is a slope of about twenty degrees.
to the left.
erm to your left yeah.
and go down five centimetres.
okay.
right.
along six centimetres to your left.
that's near about the edge of the page then.
oh right.
you should be about a couple of centimetres just just beside the page just off the page.
and.
you've got white mountain there haven't you.
mmhmm.
well.
go up from where you are five centimetres and then on a slope along up to the white mountain and you should be one centimetre away from the white mountain until you're level with the peak one centimetre away from top the of the peak and in line with it.
so around the top of it.
er you don't go around the top you stop on your when you reach the top.
do you have a golden beach.
no.
no right.
have you put that in now you're just one centimetre to the left of the peak of the white mountain yeah.
no.
mmhmm.
and go up seven centimetres.
straight up.
yeah straight up.
right.
and is there a slate mountain to the right.
uh-huh.
to the right uh-huh.
are you directly opposite it right just about.
mmhmm.
well and.
go fo-- go along until you're one centimetre from the base of the slate mountain.
and er follow the slope of the slate mountain one centimetre away again.
b-- wh-- what do you mean.
you're one centimetre to the left of the slate mountain go up er fo-- the slope.
straight up the way.
no.
s-- follow the slope of the mountain.
up to the top of the mountain.
yeah.
and over and round it.
right.
okay.
and you just erm come just under to the right-hand side about two centimetres under the slate mountain.
right.
to the right-hand side of the slate mountain yeah.
go al--.
erm do you have any obstacles near you.
well.
there's submerged rocks to the left and below that there's a secret valley then there's golden beach to the right.
to the left okay.
er go along to your left until you're just underneath the left-hand side of the slate mountain.
right.
and go.
er how close are you to the rocks whatever.
ehm about three four centimetres above them.
a-- above it er to your is it to your left yeah.
mmhmm.
right.
do you have a secret valley.
mmhmm.
well.
"you go straight down to the left well slope slightly to the left of the secret valley and curve round to the bottom of it yeah and to the ""s"" right go down to the ""s"" of secret."
right.
you're just underneath that yeah.
and along five centimetres and that's finish.
what to the right.
to the right yeah.
okay that's it okay.
right.
um are you at the start.
um move downwards on the map so that the telephone kiosk you're to the left of the telephone kiosk.
right.
and continue to move downwards until you are para-- level with the stone circle.
i haven't got a stone circle.
you don't have a stone circle.
no.
okay.
do you have a stone circle on the map at all.
um i have a ruined monastery.
fine.
um do you have any obstacle below the telephone kiosk.
a broken gate and a meadow.
a brok--.
a broken gate.
directly below the telephone kiosk.
oh not directly below no.
do you have anything directly below the telephone kiosk no.
move downwards.
mmhmm.
until move completely move downwards until you're almost at the bottom of the paper.
right.
will i not fall over broken stones.
uh-huh.
are you downwards until you're almost at the bottom of the paper.
yep.
then move right along not comple-- for if you want it in inches about four inches.
have you got a meadow.
yeah.
but that's farther along.
not that far along.
not that far along.
to about the middle.
no no no no no.
move when you have gone down from the telephone kiosk and you're almost at the bottom of the paper.
mmhmm mmhmm.
move in inches about three inches along the map.
right okay.
okay.
okay.
now move.
do you have a farmer's gate upwards from where you are at the moment.
mm yeah.
it's broken.
broken yeah.
but it says farmer's gate or does it say broken gate.
no.
it says broken gate aye.
okay fine.
move upwards an-- so that you're to the left of the broken gate.
i'm too far along here.
and just level to the gatepost.
so you want me to the left of the gate.
to the gate yeah.
i'll have to go back a bit now then.
yeah.
well i wasn't sure about the distance.
okay.
okay.
now you are at the left of the gatepost.
mmhmm.
and if you see what i mean standing at the top of it yeah ehm.
do you want me to go through the gate.
no.
oh okay.
ah if as long as you're um next to the gatepost to the left that's fine.
mmhmm.
um now.
on this map if you were to move upwards slightly and to the right and then once you'd moved to the right 'til about three quarters along the paper.
mmhmm.
and then move upwards.
uh-huh.
you would come to a ruined monastery.
uh-huh.
is that the same.
yeah.
have you got a youth hostel.
no.
oh.
okay.
well.
if i go up and right i come to a youth hostel before i come to a ruined monastery.
yeah.
well it doesn't exist on mine so.
is that okay.
i can go via the.
you just have to move round okay.
you just you just have to move round okay now move.
okay.
right.
i'll explain what to do before you do it.
but on your map you'll have to avoid the youth hostel.
why.
because i don't have one on mine.
well.
can i not go through it anyway.
it's not going to eat me.
don't you think.
it might.
anyway.
okay eh.
i'll just relay mine.
okay.
am i supposed to go through this gate.
now you're at.
you're at the broken gate.
yeah.
do i.
don't move thr-- through the broken gate.
why not.
do i have to climb the wall.
p-- 'cause i don't.
oh.
okay.
okay.
so.
wha-- what does your obstacle look like.
what obstacle.
the gate.
what's it look like.
no gate.
well.
it's like a wall and then it's like a gate which is broken.
so it's it's basically two posts with a broken gate.
if i don't go through the gate i have to.
uh-huh.
okay.
and you're standing to the left of the left-hand post.
mmhmm.
by the wall.
yep well.
move up until you're slightly clear of the gatepost if you see what i mean.
right.
shall i jump over the wall.
no.
i didn't realise that there was a wall.
mine doesn't have a wall.
oh mine does.
okay.
well just.
jump over the wall.
basically jump over the wall yeah.
okay jumped.
okay.
now move right.
right okay.
and move along to about three quarters along the way of the paper.
three quarters.
uh.
okay i'll go that side okay.
now.
on my map if you were to move straight up until slightly higher than halfway up the paper.
mmhmm.
here's a ruined monastery.
there's a ruined monastery.
okey-dokey.
now.
move around the ruined monastery to the left.
to the left mmhmm.
and then move.
do you have any obstacles between the monastery and the lake.
um not directly no.
the lake is slightly lo-- the lake is lower down the lake is lower down than the monastery is.
is it.
it is on this one yeah.
oh well my lake's in the top right-hand corner.
oh i see.
i have a west lake which is on the east actually but never mind.
oh i have an east lake.
yeah okay.
do you have a stile.
yes.
you do have a stile.
i have a stile.
now is the s--.
it's above the monastery.
it's.
above the monastery.
it's above and to the left of the monastery.
yeah.
okay.
now move over the top of the monastery if you see what i mean in relation to the paper.
oh i've just moved underneath.
no no well.
go back and move over the top.
okay right okey-dokey.
and then move left and upwards 'til you come to the stile.
i'm not sure how that's going to aff-- affect your lake.
what on a diagonal.
well.
you could move aro-- you could move around and down in a sort of circular if you like you don't have to move diagonally.
well.
it's the easiest way.
yeah i suppose.
shorter.
i suppose.
don't tire yourself out erm.
now move.
directly upwards until you're clear of the stile much the same way as you did with the gate.
mmhmm.
jumping over the fence.
yeah.
and then move.
do you have any obstacles between the stile and the dead tree.
do you have a dead tree.
i have no.
no r--.
i have a dut--.
in relation to the.
dutch elm if that's any good.
so where are you at the moment.
i'm above the stile.
above the stile that's fine.
now.
if level with the stile on the extreme right-hand side there's a dead tree.
mmhmm.
well.
i've got a dutch elm.
well.
that's dead isn't it.
not necessarily.
why.
it might not have had dutch elm disease.
it wouldn't be a dutch elm then.
fine okay you've got a tree.
okay.
yes.
i've got a tree.
now.
i'll just have to relay the route on the map.
okay.
okay.
move left from where you are at the moment so that you're above the stile but stop when you get past the stile.
yeah.
okay ehm.
i'm above the stile now.
you're above the stile.
now move in a move right so that when you s-- so that you stop just after the stile finishes.
ehm.
you're bloody useless.
i'm on the right of the stile anyway.
are you.
yeah.
told you.
why aren't you on the left of it.
well.
i didn't go to the left of it.
well.
you ought to have gone to the left of it.
well.
you didn't say.
okay.
i'm saying now.
so.
you want me to go to the left and then back to the right again.
yeah.
go to the left.
right okay.
okay.
then move upwards and to the right.
okay.
and stop when the stile stops.
okay.
okay.
i'm in exactly the same place as i was before when you going to t--.
yeah i know.
but but at least you've gone round the stile.
okay.
and there might be a monster who inhabits the right-hand of the stile you don't know.
oh.
well.
i've missed it now.
now right.
now move straight up until you're about three quarters.
what about this dead tree.
well.
we're coming to that in a minute.
okay right.
so.
move three quarters upwards in relation.
three quarters of what upwards.
to the entire map.
well.
i'm about three quarters upwards anyway.
well.
a bit further upwards.
don't move very much then.
have you got a popular tourist spot.
a poplar.
popular tourist spot.
no.
oh i have.
shall i miss it out.
well well.
if the maps may not be the same presumably you're we're going to have to avoid these obstacles.
mmhmm.
have you got a great viewpoint.
yeah.
yeah.
i've actually got two great viewpoints.
oh i've only got one that's not fair.
how far do i walk from where.
you can have my map if you want two i'm i'm not very keen on great viewpoints.
okay.
so do i go near the great viewpoint or not very far.
um ah.
so the great viewpoint's in the way.
well.
it's about sort of four inches up.
four inches up and slightly to the left.
well.
very very slightly.
are we going to go to this tree afterwards.
uh-huh.
well.
can i not go straight down because otherwise i'll have to go over the.
where are you at the moment.
above the stile.
above the stile.
on this map there's a a sort of a bump basically in in the route.
bump like a like a hill.
yeah.
no no no.
well like a hill except yeah i suppose.
yeah okay so.
what i mean by that is there's a bump in the route there isn't a bump on the map.
okay.
i'll go right.
i've gone i've gone further up.
right.
now move right and down in a sort of circular sweep until you get to the dead tree.
right.
to the tree.
yay.
and then move around a-- and.
what side of the tree do you want me to be on.
oh on the right side of the tree i want you to finish up on the right side of the tree.
right okay.
then move up and left and up so that you're to the right of the great viewpoint when you finish.
okay.
assuming that your great viewpoint's in the same place as mine.
oh i've got to be on the left hang on.
ah.
what.
i have two great viewpoints.
oh.
okay tuba ehm.
go back until you're right of the dead tree.
right i'm by the tree.
right.
do you have a lake to the top.
i've an east lake.
to the top that's fine.
now.
below the east lake.
uh-huh.
there's a great viewpoint as well.
well i've got a rocket laun-- launch pad.
well.
that probably.
same thing.
similar.
yeah.
fine.
so if you can move.
where is the rocket launch pad in relation to the lake.
erm it's beneath the lake on the right side.
beneath the lake on the right side.
mmhmm.
mm.
how can it be beneath the lake and on the right.
well.
it's beneath the lake and a bit on the right edge of the lake rather than on the left edge of the lake.
nope.
oh i see.
oh.
is that not it.
well.
the great viewpoint that i have is below the lake and if there was a midline through the lake it would be probably s-- s-- very slightly to the left of the midline.
oh oh okay well.
if i just go up say about by the edge of the lake where it's.
if you go upwards and stop below the bottom of the lake so that you're about two thirds along the length of the lake.
mmhmm.
right.
okay.
okay.
right.
now.
if you move left and along the bottom of the lake until the lake finishes.
yeah hang on i've done this wrong.
no.
yeah.
right.
i was underneath the tree.
uh-huh.
and i've done a very squiggly line.
yeah.
ehm.
and i went up and along left and then up again.
you went up.
and a-- up and along and up.
up along to the left and then up.
uh-huh.
and i'm about two thirds along the lake.
along the lake.
from the left of the lake two thirds along.
and.
no.
two thirds along from the right.
i see.
no you want to be two thirds along from the left.
okay.
so after the rocket launch.
yeah.
okay.
and then where do i go up to the lake and along left.
now wh--.
where you are from where you are at the moment if you were.
making a right pig's ear of this map.
if you move.
left and along the base of the lake.
okay.
okay all along right.
until the lake finishes.
well.
the lake's quite long.
yeah.
right okay.
now.
you ought to be standing at the.
mmhmm.
do you want me to go down a bit.
no.
you ought to be standing.
if the lake continued down if the edge of the lake wasn't curved.
mm upwards.
yeah.
mmhmm.
then you ought to be standing at the extreme left edge of the lake.
yeah.
you are.
mmhmm.
well.
that's you finished.
oh.
okay ehm.
have you got a starting point above the missionary camp.
uh-huh i have yeah.
and have you got gorillas.
no.
well.
they're in the bottom left-hand corner.
bottom.
roughly up a bit huh.
o-- of the camp or of the map.
of the map.
of the map.
now.
i have a banana tree instead.
right okay.
so.
if you just go left from the missionary camp a bit and then down.
left and down.
yeah.
to about a couple of centimetres above the top of the bottom of the page.
yeah.
and then continue straight left along until about four centimetres from the end and then go straight up again.
so that i'm on the left of what i have as a banana tree.
sorry.
so that i end up on the left of what is the banana tree on this map or maybe the gorillas on yours.
yeah probably yeah.
okay.
uh do you have a rope bridge.
i do.
ehm do i avoid the missionary camp where i'm moving.
yeah.
so i move along so that i'm to the left of the missionary camp when i go down.
uh-huh yeah.
okay.
now.
i'm at the left-hand side of the banana tree about.
right.
almost the extreme left of the page and about four centimetres up.
mmhmm.
about quarter of the way up.
okay that's fine.
now.
you've got the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
so that you want to come up the page and then just when you're about in line with the rope rope bridge just turn right so you're across it.
okay.
so i'm going straight up and actually cross over the rope bridge.
yeah.
so i move up and cross over the rope bridge.
right so.
i'm now standing at the other side of the rope bridge.
okay.
if you now come down a couple of centimetres.
uh-huh yeah.
and do you have a waterfall.
yeah.
it's right of where i am at the moment.
yeah.
if you just.
mm do you have a sort of the water coming down.
uh-huh.
if you sort of head along.
mmhmm.
so that you're about in line with the bottom of the water.
uh-huh.
if you know what i mean.
yeah.
and then.
have you got lost steps.
no no steps.
okay.
if you just get to the waterfall first.
and then you want to go straight up to where these lost steps are.
oh yeah which are where.
well.
have you got fallen pillars.
mm yeah i do yeah.
it's sor-- it's.
in the finishing point.
no.
no.
ehm it's about in line with the fallen pillars.
uh-huh.
to the right of them.
yeah.
in between the rope bridge and the waterfall.
all right so you've the rope bridge and the waterfall and the fallen pillars.
hmm.
so at the moment i'm at the waterfall.
uh-huh.
well you want to go straight up.
do--.
straight up.
and you've got the lost steps.
yeah.
so i'm straight up i'm now at the top of the waterfall ehm not quite halfway up the page.
so--.
uh.
if you go straight up from the waterfall you keep going up until you're in line with the fallen pillars.
okay.
but don't actually go near them.
yeah okay that's fine.
and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left.
uh-huh.
you'll miss the lost steps.
okay.
and how far along do i move.
um to about just before the middle of the page.
fine.
and then you want to come down in a diagonal.
so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them.
uh-huh.
okay that's fine.
i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars.
right just keep going 'til the end.
okay.
of the fallen pillars.
yeah.
um now go down two or three centimetres.
yeah.
do you have an obstacle there.
i do.
flamingoes.
well uh.
i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve.
uh-huh.
yeah.
and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page.
yeah.
then.
do you have ancient ruins.
um ruined city is about three quarters up on the page and just slightly to the right of where i am at the moment.
yeah.
okay.
just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left.
yeah yeah uh-huh.
well.
you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit.
yeah.
without actually coming into contact with them.
yeah okay.
so i'm i'm moving right basically.
a straight line.
right.
now do i move up so that i'm level with the ruined city.
yeah.
uh um okay.
right now i'm i'm on the left-hand side of the ruined city and about three quarters of the way up the page.
yeah.
now.
do you have stones in the top left.
eh no.
i have a rock fall which is about halfway along the page and about three quarters of the way up.
no no it's okay.
now if you just uh.
at the top there's some stones and that's about four centimetres from the top.
uh-huh.
okay.
so just continue to move straight up.
yeah.
until almost at the top.
to about four centimetres.
fine.
and then you want to go sharp right.
mm.
to about halfway across the page.
okay.
now.
do you have a white mountain.
uh-huh.
you want to just go over the top of that and round.
so go over the mountain.
mmhmm.
okay.
ehm i'm at about three quarters of the way along and at almost at the top of the page.
yeah okay.
um do you have a soft furnishings store.
no.
i've got lost steps actually.
eh right um you're quite close to the mountain at the moment on its right-hand side.
yeah.
yeah.
well if you.
under directly underneath the mountain about three centimetres down there's a soft furnishings store.
yeah.
so you want to come down from the mountain and turn sharp left.
mountain and move.
yeah.
so that you're sort of in line with the left-hand side of the mountain.
okay.
then you come straight down and right.
and straight down and.
do you have gazelles.
yeah.
underneath them.
so.
do i move to the left-hand or the right-hand side of the gazelles.
the right-hand side.
fine.
to about the right-hand side of the mountain level if you know what i mean.
oh i see right that's a bit further along fine.
okay.
that's it.
so i've stopped so ehm i am three quarters of the way along slightly more than halfway up and to the right of the gazelles.
yeah.
yeah.
that's right.
fine okay.
on you go.
right.
the start bit's on the left-hand side about a quarter of the way up.
i've got the s-- start mark on.
have you.
yes.
right so.
it's just above a camera shop.
mmhmm.
right.
so down the side of the camera shop.
down.
down.
have you got a west lake.
i've got an east lake away up the top right-hand side.
ssh ssh but see i've got the things you havenae got.
oh right.
that was th-- i didnae understand the first time right.
you've got i've got like huge lake up there.
right.
have you got the allotments allotments.

is it in between the camera shop and allotments.
no no.
straight down the side of the camera shop.
right.
right.
right.
i'm starting.
to about fi--.
right.
i'm level with shop right on the writing just now.
down the left-hand side of the shop.
no.
i've gone down the wrong side forget that.
right.
down the left-hand side of the shop right.
yeah.
i've got it this time sorry.
to about five centimetres from the bottom of the page.
mm right.
and then go go to your right.
where.
about.
have you got anything there or anything no.
mmhmm.
go to.
directly under allotments.
no no.
go to your right about erm say five centimetres again.
right.
and then go straight up the s-- 'til you're.
between the allotments and the camera shop.
see the where the allotments are just to the side of the allotments you should be go straight up to just at the side the allotments.
straight up to there.
uh-huh.
the left-hand side of the allotments.
aye aye.
right.
i'm there.
and then.
like imagine the allotments are like horizontal.
right.
are the horizontal.
right.
right.
and then go a-- an angle at say fffsss twenty-five thirty degrees above the horizontal right that are at the allotments to your right.
right.
see what i mean.
to where.
to about.
have you got the flight museum on there.
er.
no.
have you got disused monastery.
uh-huh.
but you're going like up th-- like twenty-five thirty degrees.
so where am i where am i heading.
i know i know i understand that.
right.
about to about two thirds of the way across the page.
right.
two thirds of the way across the page you mean it's a big huge line i'm drawing here.
mmhmm.
right.
i've got a flight museum so i'll need to miss that.
have you got telephone box.
uh-huh.
so am i where f-- where am i going to end up.
you should be nowhere near the telephone box you should only be like about a third of the way up the page and a third of the way across the page.
two thirds of the way across the page and a third of the way up the p-- up the page.
two th--.
am i going to be in line with the telephone box vertically.
no.
no.
should just be a wee bit over from them.
have you got the level crossing.
no.
have you got the east lake.
what the east lake uh-huh.
uh-huh.
see the far left of the east lake.
uh-huh.
see if you go directly down.
aye.
is that how far across i should be.
aye except a wee bit further over than that about a centimetre maybe.
right.
and what how h-- how high am i going to be.
about a third of the way up the page.
right well i've got i've s-- i understand that a bit.
that was meant to be like thirty degrees from the horizontal.
right there you go.
i've got a flight museum there i'll need to go round that.
right.
so where do you want me to go now.
right.
straight up to the disused monastery.
straight up to it.
mmhmm.
ah that's no problem i think right.
right and then.
sort of round the top of the disused monastery.
which way.
to your left.
to the left.
over the top of it.
have you got the alpine garden.
uh-huh.
but over the top of it and curve down like to.
like see where the writing disused monastery is.
right.
go to your l-- like don't draw anything here right just go to your left a wee bit over.
i've got it.
"right i'm just at the ""d"" right i'm not drawing."
and then just go about two centimetres over.
right.
right.
so where you are n-- other side of disused monastery right you curve round.
i'm not at the other side of the disused monastery.
right.
you've went straight up and you're at the disused monastery right.
right.
i'm just underneath it i'm at.
see.
you go over the top of it right to your left.
i go right round the disused monastery.
you said over the top of what.
disused monastery right.
right.
over the top of it right.
right got it.
round the left-hand side.
uh-huh.
got it right.
right i'm now above it.
right over the top to the left-hand side.
right.
uh i'm sitting above the disused monastery right.
right.
further over to your left and down 'til you're like in line.
er.
s-- start again right start again.
right.
you've went straight up right and then.
where should i be just now where sh-- where do you want me to be.
at the right-hand side of the disused monastery.
how did i get there did i go right round it from the left.
no no.
like this is look where are you now tell me where you are.
in the middle of disused monastery above it.
right fine.
keep going left.
right.
but i went the opposite way i came round from the left.
what.
i came round from the left.
right.
that's that's what you said to.
from the allotments right you went in an angle up the way to about.
right.
and then you went st-- directly straight up the way.
straight up.
and i like i was in the middle of the disused monastery.
in the middle of it straight through the middle of it.
no no.
just underneath it in line with the middle.
no.
you shouldn't have been you should have been round the side of it at the right-hand side.
well.
do you want me i'll change it then.
right.
see i-- but i've got a flight museum there that's what put me off i had to.
go round the side just the side of the disused monastery.
right.
so i'm going right round the top of it now.
mmhmm.
right.
um.
that's a lot of garbage that.
right got it now.
that was a laugh it's that flight museum that's putting me off.
well.
i've no got that on my map right.
right fine.

right.
so you go s-- sort of.
t--.
see where the words disused monastery are right.
right.
go to your le-- the right no with your pen you're just like your finger say right go to your left about two centimetres three centimetres.
aye.
and.
go straight up.
that's how far down you go.
right.
right.
in line with that's how far down you go with your pen.
mmhmm.
right.
mmhmm.
so do that then.
oh right i understand what you mean but.
do you see what i mean.
i've i've knackered a wee bit doesnae matter.

and then round to your right over the top of it.
have you got a level crossing.
no.
have you got youth hostel no.
nope.
right.
i'll need to go round the youth hostel now right i'm over the top alpine garden.
right.
"above the ""d"" sort of the ""d"" of alpine garden it just goes."
"i'm actually above well by the ""n"" but it doesnae matter it doesnae make that accurate."
well.
you need to go round the youth hostel so you go straight up the top right no no straight up and then.
"from the ""d""."
mmhmm.
right.
i'll go back a bit then.
how far.
so you're.
you got the picket fence.
uh-huh.
as far as that.
no.
well.
between alpine garden and picket fence there's a gap.
how.
about.
half way.
no.
about three quarters.
three quarters.
right.
and go to your right about two centimetres three centimetres.
got it.
and then s-- s-- have.
you got a telephone box.
it's away to the right of disused monastery.
you've got the telephone box is away over on the right-hand side about halfway bottom of it's about halfway up the page.

right.
and then sort of go er.
where.
have you got the east lake.
uh-huh.
where are where are we aiming to finish here.

right.
well it's sort of curving.
i think.
to where.
up the way sort of curving up the way to about erm.
see at the m-- the east lake see the bottom line.
aye there's a sort of.
well.
halfway in between that.
in a sort of sloping line.
the bottom the very bottom line like imagine that's cut in half.
is it a sloping line.
right.
and then.
like you're sort of.
i've t-- to curve up there.
uh-huh.
so like you're sort of curving up to you're a halfway a like the halfway of the east lake.
well.
i've got a level crossing i'll avoid that.
right.
right i'm there.
'til you're just at the bottom of the east lake.
aye well a wee bit off it you know.
then go to your left.
have you got the parked van.
uh-huh.
where now.
go to your left about.
see where the the bottom line of the east lake right.
right.
erm.
see the the left-hand point of it.
aye.
the bottom line.
aye i see it now.
well.
about about er maybe two centimetres out from that that's how far you go.
got it.
that's you finished.
that's the parked f-- that's us at the end.
uh-huh.
right.
right.
see the start.
you got to say sarah and danielle.
oh aye sarah and danielle.
right.
right.
see the start.
it's above the diamond mine.
right.
right.
okay.
i want you go down about three inches.
where down past the diamond mine.
yeah.
right.
just down at the side just straight down.
okay.
and then go round in a curve underneath the diamond mine.
right mm.
then you want to start like carry on that curve for about f-- four or five inches just gradually heading up the way.
right.
so i'm making a curve round the diamond mine yeah.
no no no no.
no no no no.
f-- past the diamond mine.
not that not that steep a curve like just.
pass it.
yeah just slightly.
just like just more a wee bit more than a straight line along past the diamond mine.
yeah right okay right.
i sp-- i don't suppose you've got a graveyard have you.
ehm no.
no right.
got a fast running creek and canoes and things.
yeah okay.
what you want to do is is you want to be sort of like going up and then curving right round the fast flowing creek.
what round up the top of it.
yeah over the top.
right.
and down the right-hand side.
the right-hand side.
right.
yeah.
see your apache camp.
yeah.
right.
head down towards that and then just curve down the left-hand side that.
so.
i'm bypassing canoes.
yeah.
canoes.
oh well.
maybe you don't have canoe.
no.
i've no got any canoes.
right okay.
left-hand side of the apache.
do you see the carved wooden pole.
ehm no.
don't have one.
no.
you see the walled city.
yeah.
right well.
when you when you're coming down the left-hand of the apache camp just keep heading along and go over the top of the walled city.
over the top.
okay.
okay.
and then just like a nice big curve heading down about six inches.
mmhmm.
now where which way am i heading down.
you see the carved wooden pole at the bottom.
aye.
well.
you you need to be about two inch you you need to end up about two inches from the top there.
from the top.
two inches above it.
and it's on the left well i'm coming from the left to go to above it.
yeah.
right.
sort of curving round.
now see stone creek.
yeah.
right.
you're just heading along past that.
you see the flat rocks.
no.
no.
no.
great ehm.
okay.
head up ehm past stone creek you need to be going at about up curving up to the right at about a forty-five degree angle.
so i'm going over stone creek.
aye.
well.
above it anyway.
on no wait a minute i have got flat rocks.
right you well da--.
right.
you're going past you're going up over stone creek.
and your line's just about touching where flat rocks is written.
yeah.
okay.
so that's where you want to end up.
right.
right.
now keep heading to the right a bit.
mmhmm.
further until you're about an inch away from the edge of the paper.
right.
right.
right.
see the buffalo.
mmhmm.
ah.
right right.
head down the right sand hand side of the paper.
and curve underneath the buffalo.
yeah.
right.
do you see a cattle ranch no.
nope.
right ehm.
you see that fort.
mmhmm.
away at the other side.
right.
you're heading to go under that but like on your way about halfway between the buffalo and the fort there's a wee blip in your line.
mmhmm.
like you're going over the top something and then coming back down and going under the fort.
yeah.
so just do that.
right.
and then go under the fort.
right.
where are you now then.
i'm under the fort.
right.
you just want to curve up the left-hand side of the fort just curve a nice big curve round it.
mmhmm.
and that's it you're finished.
good.
right.
you go down to the bottom left corner to the left of the camera shop.
to the left of the camera shop.
yes.
to the bottom corner.
ehm.
y-- yeah eh er you have a parked van marked on your map underneath the camera shop.
no.
no.
well about an inch from the bottom of the page you sudden-- you go right and then up to the corner of the allotments to the left-hand side.
so go right underneath the camera shop at the bottom.
yes.
and then up.
and then up.
straight up.
the left-hand side of the allotments.
yes.
i stop at the top of the allotments.
yes.
and.
right.
you have a l-- a yacht club in the bottom right corner.
yes.
slightly to the left of that you have to draw a point on a level with the c-- the top of the camera shop and then draw a straight line from the corner of the allotments to that point.
so have you got a flight museum on your.
no.
no.
so i've got to go along from the allotments to the right.
yes.
and how far away from the yacht club.
it's on a l-- it's on a level with the cam-- the roof of the camera shop horizontally and vertically slightly to the left of the c-- yacht club.
uh-huh.
right.
you got that.
mmhmm.
then you go straight up and curve over the top of the disused monastery.
straight up right.
have you over th-- o-- are you eh curved over the monastery.
mmhmm above the monastery.
you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve.
so it's right round the monastery.
yeah.
mmhmm.
then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden.
roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it.
s--.
then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden.
mmhmm.
then to the right 'til the other side of the lef-- the alpine garden and straight up.
now have you got a youth hostel marked there.
no.
no.
well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the right.
have you got parked van.
yes.
it's it's below the parked van.
uh-huh.
it's about it's below the level of the picket fence.
have you got that.
yeah.
it's about an inch below the level of the picket fence.
right.
uh-huh.
and then you go to your right.
underneath the parked van.
yes.
to appro-- to roughly about the middle of the parked van a line and that.
uh-huh.
and do you have a telephone box.
yeah.
well do.
you the next stage is you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-hand side of the youth hostel down to.
i don't have youth hostel.
oh right.
well from that point that i've just gone round.
mmhmm.
down to the it's slightly to the left of the telephone box 'cause there's.
so vertical.
have you got level crossing.
no.
no.
there's a v-- there's a hori-- horizontal line that goes under the telephone box.
uh-huh.
eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at.
right.
right i've done that.
then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box.
mmhmm.
then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a ve-- a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake.
mmhmm.
so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake.
so i curve round that.
yes.
right.
to the middle of the east lake.
to a line approximately just it's below the m--.
yeah uh-huh.
east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence.
mm right.
done that.
right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side.
mmhmm.
so sorry say that again.
on a l-- eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence.
mmhmm.
about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer m-- the left most part of east lake.
right.
actually touches the.
it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake.
no.
right.
think that's where it is.
right ready.
yeah.
okay.
okay.
go n-- start at start.
do you have a start.
yeah.
do you have you're at start.
okay.
uh-huh.
um alright.
go directly south but make the shape of a little camel's hump direct--.
what way.
directly south.
right.
say you know.
how far is that how far south before i make a camel's hump.
the nor--.
just just on your way south make a little hump.
and go down about oh three inches.
like.
how big's the hump like.
just like a wee little like a little hill.
aye.
but how-- how bi-- how long a one.
just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump to.
a curve a curvy line.
it does.
pardon yeah yeah.
sort of j-- well well just with one but i d-- i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inches.
right okay.
then go.
one two.
east about two inches.
east.
mm.
that's right isn't it.
and then go.
or maybe no just go east about one inch.
oh shit no no.
no.
well.
does it go through any obstacles.
no.
we're trying to avoid one.
right.
so.
i think right.
there so what we want to do now well we should have gone.
well.
one and a half inches along that would be better.
right.
um.
to the left.
we'll see.
okay because.
to the right i mean.
yeah to the right.
okay.
yeah.
right okay that's done.
but so.
now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of that.
yeah.
have you got a name written on it.
that wee obstacle.
c--.
carpenter.
yeah.
so have i.
okay.
right okay.
and so now.
we're right below the green bay.
do you have that.
no.
n-- that's different in mine.
okay anyway s--.
right wait a minute right hang on right.
diagonal sort of like.
north yeah.
northeast diagonal.
how long.
yeah.
about two inches maybe.
right okay.
i don't know really inches that well.
well yeah just sort of roughly.
right okay that's.
okay.
so.
now we want to go to the right which is to the east.
yeah.
so.
along to some trees maybe roughly.
yeah.
right.
well we want to of this is what i okay well let's see.
we want to go st-- east east about two inches.
right.
and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these trees.
right.
to sort of cut from above the trees to cut in to the left of them.
to to come in below.
yeah yeah the left of the trees.
right.
and then.
how how long do you want that diagonal to be.
ah well.
it has to go east right about two inches and then come down about an inch and a half.
right an inch and a half.
so.
it it doesn't go directly from it's sort of like more like a slope.
so.
"almost like half a ""zed"" shape."
"you know like a z-- letter ""zed""."
mmhmm.
right okay i've done that.
"you mean ""zee""."
"yeah i mean ""zed""."
"""zed"" okay."
to me eh.
so now so he-- alright.
here we are.
right.
so now.
there's another little obstacle.
yeah.
and ah.
oh trees.
well.
well.
there were trees that we just.
yeah.
got by and now.
i'm.
well.
i'm not quite beyond well i'm just about bo-- at the bottom of them.
yeah yeah.
that's exactly where you should be.
right okay.
but now is there something even be-- right below the trees.
no there isn't.
okay well.
there's a there's a bit a couple of bits down called fields.
yeah that's we're above there we're halfway.
okay.
we're right at the bottom of the trees right.
uh-huh.
and what we want to do is.
so i'm picking my nose kara shit right.
carry on sorry.
what we want to do.
right i come.
is make like alright.
say you're at the bottom of the seven beeches.
right.
you want to take your index finger and do like a semicircle right from there to the top of the fields just like a sort of a.
like a big curve like.
yeah yeah.
a s-- eh half a curve though.
yeah.
just so it's like a curve to the right and it's only that.
okay.
like if it like 'cause i'm left handed like if i put my hand on that and just swiveled my hand right round.
and s--.
if you put your left index finger and just go to the right.
yeah.
and it's like a half semicircle half circle.
right okay.
okay so now.
we're at the top.
to to right above the t-- th-- the fields.
fields yeah.
right okay.
and then like.
say say you put your thumb.
so so yeah sorry.
put your left thumb right over the fields and then trace around it.
what.
put put y--.
bend it.
no i'm left handed so it'd be my right thumb.
no no.
your left i'm doing it with my left hand.
oh right.
how h-- h--.
put okay.
put your put your left thumb just so the tip of your thumb is facing right is facing east.
right.
uh-huh.
and then just put it over the fields and then like trace around your thumb 'til the base or 'til the base of the thumb where it connects to the rest of the hand.
but.
what what bit how do you mean.
okay.
well.
i cannae do it with my left hand though.
why not.
cannae draw it with my left hand 'cause my thumb my left-hand thumb's on the on the bit of paper.
yeah.
just well just use the right thing 'cause all you need to do is trace around your thumb.
will it not go through the fields.
well.
it should be you sh-- your thumb should be directly on the fields and then you should be going around it.
well it's the fiel--.
so.
it's like just like tracing round the fields really.
yeah yeah.
right okay.
and then to where the base.
ah your hands are much smaller than mine.
what way do you want me to trace round the fields it goes right round the fields like takes a right round the fields.
yeah you go right around the fields.
and then you go left again to the base of your thumb.
right okay right i'm just doing that now.
'cause it looks like it looks like a hand sort of well my thumb's a lot bigger than yours.
god i didn't realise my thumb was such a funny shape.
yeah right it's okay we've handled it i think.
okay so.
now.
it's mental shape that.
i know it's cool.
right.
alright um.
now we want to go due south.
for about two inches.
uh.
and come right along to the edge of the bay.
uh-huh.
right.
and then s--.
right.
right to the edge of the bay.
yeah like about.
touching the bay.
no.
just like leaving a wee space.
right okay.
in between.
and then.
does the bay sort of slope down to the left.
well.
there's a it's li-- li-- there's a almost like a wee headland right where i'm coming down there's it's like a flat bit of the bay right and if you move to your left it's all like a headland jutting out into the bay like a a shallow curve.
you.
yeah.
going into the bay.
yeah.
just trace along that curve.
right.
'til you come to the next wee point.
right okay.
where it sort of 'cause then then like the bay drops down.
uh-huh.
so.
just where the bay drops down stop there.
right okay i've done that.
okay and now.
uh-uh.
what we want to do is like a little waterfall sort of.
like.
do you have.
what.
directly to your left do you have like cliffs and with a meadow on top of it.
no.
i've got attractive cliffs at the bottom of th--.
see where the bay goes down.
yeah.
it the it's at the bottom there.
and then do you have anything ahead of it on top of.
not above it no nothing.
that okay.
there's a big empty space so.
okay.
v-- but that okay.
what there is a meadow up there so.
oh i've go-- i've got vast meadows but it's about six inches above it.
okay no.
i have something that you don't then.
right okay.
but so 'cause there's another vast meadow about an inch up from the attractive cliffs.
right.
so.
we need to go in between the attractive cliffs and this meadow so like slope down to the.
so.
what about going across this drop in the bay then.
yeah.
so.
what you do go left at gentle slope 'til you're about a half an inch above the attractive cliffs and go straight to the left above them so a gentle slope down 'til the right of the attractive cliffs.
right.
and then just straight left.
yeah.
just straight left for about an inch and a half.
right i think i've done that right.
and then another gentle slope down to the left about an inch long.
yeah.
or inch and a half.
uh-huh.
i'm getting near the end of the edge of the paper though.
yeah.
ah okay oh are you.
yeah.
okay because alright s--.
have you got a crashed spaceship down there.
just below the attractive cliffs.
no.
all i have is a chestnut tree.
no.
i've got a chestnut tree right i've got attractive cliffs and then und-- straight underneath that.
you have a spaceship.
ha i've got a chestnut tree right so d-- but on the left-hand side between the two that's where the spaceship is.
on the left of the chestnut tree.
yeah.
see see the attractive cliffs and chestnut tree are sort of in a straight well not really a straight line but one under the other.
yeah yeah.
yeah.
you've got a crashed space crashed spaceship on the left-hand side.
okay.
'cause that's where we're su-- is do you have a f-- an that's where we're supposed to finish.
oh right.
so.
what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down about.
i'm not at the edge i've g-- i've got about an inch and a half to go i'm.
okay.
just above i've just come through the attractive cliffs.
mm.
bit.
oke-- okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper.
right.
and then you drop down about an inch and a half.
uh-huh.
then you go to the right about an inch.
and a little bloop up.
what.
right.
"then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an ""x"" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree."
oh.
you're making me pick my nose.
well we we might be in di-- the chestnut trees might be in different position.
is it a bloop like a kind of round bit.
yeah just.
like what we did round the fields.
sort of but very very j--.
earlier on.
no.
it's like it's so slight it's only like it's less than a quarter of an inch 'cause you just came to.
what to the left or to the right.
just straight up.
straight up.
no.
i guess it doesn't matter.
i'm coming right wait a minute.
i'm coming down the way right i've come across sort of diagonally in a curve past the cliff cliffs and i've dropped down about half an inch.
mmhmm.
just over half an inch three quarters of an inch right.
so how f-- how.
where do and i'm just above the spaceship right.
okay so.
so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got.
is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree.
no.
it's just above the tree.
oh no you should be y--.
it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tree.
okay.
well just just.
"go to the right about an inch and then draw an ""x"" and we'll be done."
right.
i got to see your map.
right.
okay.
okay.
it's great yeah.
i i it's probably nothing like what you said.
okay.
right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner.
right right.
the camera shop's ri-- directly below the start position right.
yes.
you move down to l-- past the left-hand side of the camera shop.
no right.
and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop.
no.
no-- it's just allotments to the eh right.
no.
and slightly below.
you move.
well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments.
and where do i stop.
stop just at the bot-- the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed.
right.
right.
then you move in an angle slo-- sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop.
so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the.
it's not marked on my map.
oh right.
ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically.
slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop.
right.
so you make an angle and that's a straight line.
a straight line yes.
right.
from there to just above the camera shop.
yeah.
approximately two thirds away t-- from the right-hand side of the page.
uh from the right-hand side of the page.
no sorry.
one third away from the right-hand side of the page.
right.
that's just below the flight museum.
okay.
well pu--.
have you got yacht club marked bottom right corner.
yes uh-huh.
well it's just slightly to the left of the yacht club on a level with the camera shop roof.
okay.
and where do we go after that.
you turn straight up the page and make a straight line which curves over and around top of the disused monastery.
have you got that mark.
what on top of the monastery.
above the monastery.
and t-- uh right okay that's okay.
to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the left.
right.
so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm about.
approximately three inches.
same level as the camera shop basically.
three four inches.
yeah.
and then eh from there going to disused monastery.
yes.
right.
curving around the top of the disused monastery.
yeah right.
right.
so curve around the disused monastery then where.
and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately li-- like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the gr-- the alpine garden.
right.
could you just say that again.
right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough.
right.
and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden.
right.
so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery.
no.
a curve poin-- going down the way uh.
that's what i mean.
i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically.
yes.
right.
and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden.
yeah.
you stop on a level with the m-- disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden.
right.
right.
then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden.
then you mak-- go right to the end of the alpine garden.
then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel.
there is no youth hostel.
then about three inches.
where was the youth hostel.
youth hostel was t-- upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically.
right.
right i think i know where it is.
right ehm where where would i be going after that.
after where.
after the this youth hostel.
after youth hostel.
you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical.
right.
eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to.
the telephone box.
right okay uh right.
so i go up just below th-- just to below the parked van.
have you got a parked van.
no.
you go to about t-- two inches below the parked van.
right.
right.
and then from there.
you go.
so it's.
two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box.
right.
all right.
underneath the telephone telephone box.
yes.
right.
not directly underneath it.
ehm.
you're going to draw a s-- you're going to have to draw a straight line adding on to that that passes underneath the telephone box.
right right okay.
okay.
then there's a straight line going under the telephone box.
right.
and a vertical line going up the right-hand side of the telephone box.
and where does it go to.
it stops about level with the top of the telephone box.
then there's a sort of exponential curve that goes up to your right from that point and it starts to become vertical to the left of the telephone box on a l-- line left of the telephone box.
and where's it going to is it going to the level crossing.
it's going.
not marked on my map.
it's going to the right to the left of the thatched mud hut and.
i don't have a thatched mud hut.
no.
whe-- have you got an east lake.
yes.
it stops approximately th-- on a line through the middle of the east lake.
mm right.
ehm well i've got a level crossing just below the the the ehm east lake.
it'll probably mean go through that then.
through the level crossing.
ehm aren't we meant to eh avoid obstacles.
avoid them.
yeah.
right ehm.
i need to go ehm where where is it going is it going to eh eh parked van or some place.
ehm no.
eh where.
it's going to the right of the parked van underneath the lef-- the very left-hand point of the east lake.
right.
so it's between ehm.
it's on a level with the picket fence.
have you got that top left corner.
yeah i've got that.
the finish point is on a level with that underneath the most left point of the east lake.
right.
r-- i'll go round it the level crossing.
okay.
right.
is it a straight line or a curve.
it curves.
eh if the telephone box is there it curves up and then goes like that.
right.
from that's from seen from my point of view.
and that's from the right-hand side of the telephone box.
from the right-hand side of the telephone box it goes to the left-hand point.
right.
well i can't do an exponential so.
that's the path marked there.
i'll see what i can do.
right.
that you at the finish point.
i'm just at the eh left-hand bottom corner of the east lake.
the left-hand bot-- corner.
you go just about an inch to your left.
right.
and that's the finish point.

right.
on a level with the picket fence.
okay ehm.
your start is above the caravan park.
uh-huh.
now.
you've to head down ehm on the left of the caravan park right beside the edge of the page.
okay.
right down to.
at a slant or.
no.
just straight down.
straight down right straight down.
very near about an inch away from the bottom of the page.
ehm over the picket fence.
ehm don't know.
right.
i'll just go down it.
right.
just down to about an inch and then turn into the page sort of.
oh.
mmhmm.

yeah.
right.
well right.
you'll have to go over that then and you you go out.
so you want me to go straight along to the left and then up.
yeah that's right.
okay.
and go over that.
mmhmm.
and then turn to your right going across the page.
mmhmm.
now.
can you see an abandoned cottage.
yeah.
but there's a forest as well.
how far along do you want me to go.
ehm well.
i want you to go like very all the way along underneath the abandoned cottage but you're still a long way down.
uh-huh right.
uh-huh right.
right okay.
now.
is the forest in your way.
uh-huh.
ehm right.
if you were to go past the bottom of the abandoned cottage and then go up.
mmhmm.
could you do that.
uh-huh.
how far up do you want me to go.
i want you to go up over the abandoned cottage.
okay right.
right.
and then you've to come down say to the bottom of it but you're you're slanting to your left like forty-five degrees.
okay right.
just above a fenced meadow.
ehm no.
have you got that.
no right okay.
ehm.
well come down about forty-five degrees about.
thr-- two inches away from abandoned cottage.
mmhmm.
now you're still heading to your left.
mmhmm.
ehm you're doing sort of a a very it's a big circle heading up towards bottom of west lake.
yeah.
you see that.
so you want a big circle.
yeah.
now.
you know where the bottom sticks out.
uh-huh.
well.
you've got to go up to that point and then follow it round.
right.
so you do.
i'm up to this point right of the bottom of the west lake.
uh-huh.
and then what do i do.
now.
have you got a trig point.
a--.
right.
right you follow it round to where it the west lake starts to turn in again and then.
where there's a sort of like ehm a dip a crag sort of thing there's two sort of peaks.
yeah.
don't go that far.
right.
just go to where it before it turns to the left.
right okay.
right.
and then go over the trig point.
trig point.
you haven't got one.
i haven't got one.
right okay.
go to that point and then turn to your right.
right.
right.
now you've got to go all the way down again like about forty-five degrees to your right.
mmhmm.
back down to the level the abandoned cottage now you should about three four inches away from that.
okay.
have you got a monument.
n-- yeah.
yeah.
i sh-- i'm directly opposite the monument.
uh-huh.
well.
i want you to go underneath the monument.
in a sort of like circle shape.
yeah.
underneath it and then straight back round it again you're going halfway round monument.
right.
now.
got a nuclear test site.
nope.
no.
right.
east lake.
uh-huh.
you've got to do go slightly to the right in a small curve.
mmhmm.
and then no no no.
left and down that's right.
left.
to the left and then head up to east lake.
right.
how far up to east lake.
ehm almost right to it just right beside it.
okay.
you should be practically in the middle you know well you're further to the to the right of.
uh-huh.
east lake.
now head along beside east lake.
mmhmm.
ehm.
and then about a centimetre past where it goes up you should be at the finish.
and that's it.
ehm it's sort of like parallel to the east lake.
parallel to east lake.
right.
but don't go up when it goes up just go along about another centimetre.
and then that's it.
and that's it.
right okay.
erm.
are you at the cross at the start.
okay yeah.
right so.
go er about two inches to your ehm to your left at a sort of a-- angle.
two inches to the my.
about.
your left a sort of angle about forty-five degrees.
to er.
erm.
what's two inches sort about.
well it's two inches.
i don't know actually er.
er well ten centimetres then maybe say.
ten er to forty-five degrees slope.
to the horizontal.
have you got allotments to my right is it.
no.
it's different it's a different map ehm.
yeah.
erm t-- it can't be to my left anyway 'cause that's off the page from the start.
well.
it's to my right so it must be to your left.
no.
it's the map's turned round so it must be to my right as well if it's to your right it's to my right.
oh right sorry.
right.
go to your right then ten centimetres to your right.
erm right along or to an angle did you say.
well i.
imagine there's like a ehm a line like horizontal.
right.
yeah.
and then let's say f-- ph thirty degrees up the way.
so it's at an angle.
up the way.
up the way.
so it's like an angle like that.
up the way.
oh dear.
angled up.
t-- do you have a lake.
uh-huh.
just above the start point right.
right.
how does it go from there.
down below that.
down below that.
to about halfway down the middle of the lake.
halfway.
what's that halfway what.
the b-- see where the bottom of the the bottom line of the lake.
yeah er.
right.
to the right-hand side underneath it.
uh-huh about a.
yeah.
right.
yeah.
about halfway under that.
halfway well never mind.
right.
see the bottom line of the lake right.
oh you mean halfway from just where i would be if i went across oh no.
right.
see the bottom line of the lake right.
right.
halfway along that.
halfway along okay.
right.
right.
and then.
then.
straight down.
straight down.
about.
er maybe five centimetres.
right i've got some allotments here.
so does it go to your right again does it go right.
it sort of curves round.
curves round okay right.
and then then.
along to your right.
"it's like an ""s"" shape right but n-- not like a steep ""s"" shape like a sort of er sort of stretched out ""s"" shape."
right.
a wee bit ehm 'til you're about er halfway down the page when you get to the bottom curve that comes back out the way.
erm do i go along right.
and then you go to your left.
go to my left.
for about er five centimetres.
is there an obstacle down at the bottom left-hand corner of your page.
er but you shouldn't be down there.
this is you're over on the right-hand side at the right-hand si-- half of your page.
erm well.
a we-- is it called the west lake the start.
no.
it's east lake at the start of mine.
oh.
i've got a start at the west lake.
have we got the right maps.
bollocks.
oh.
right.
well i don't have i don't know about.
are you over at the right-hand side how about halfway down the page at the moment.
okay.
eas-- hold on start up at the east lake.
where's the start.
what do you want me to start again.
yeah.
'cause i've got a start underneath the west lake so i'm at.
oh do you know what i've been doing oh god.
what.
i've i've started from the finish that's why i wasnae even looking at that i just saw the cross er right.
oops right.
so we should be at the bottom left-hand corner of the map here right.
i've went through the the other way round that's really stupid right eh.
right.
okay right.
so the start's about.
you're at the west lake.
the start's about a third of the way up the page.
yeah no it's all right.
right.
i've got that marked on.
right.
and i've got west lake above it.
well i've not got that.
just above to the right.
no wonder we're having problems there.
right so er.
just sort of go to your left.
go to my left.
about a centimetre.
oh w-- a centimetre right hold on right now a centimetre okay right.
and then go straight down.
straight down.
to where how long.
to about two centimetres from the bottom of the page.
two centimetres from the bottom of the page okay.
then go to your right about eh five centimetres.
fffffff.
five centimetres right.
and then go.
er ch do you have any an allotments.
uh-huh.
allotments yeah.
right.
so you.
where is it with respect to that.
well.
if you go straight up the way you'll be hitting the allotments so.
yeah right yeah.
well s--.
just go straight up the way so you're a bit left of the allotments.
just left.
up about half a centimetre ef-- left.
okay right.
and then like curve round the top of the allotments.
okay.
and then go in an angle about say thirty degrees from the.
say the allotments are the horizontal right.
yeah.
go in an angle about thirty degrees up from that.
right.
from the left-hand side of the or the right-hand side of the allotments above the right-hand side.
above the right-hand side.
thirty degrees.
roughly.
thir--.
and then say about ehm eh over to about two thirds of the way over the side of the page to the right.
erm do you have a flight museum anywhere.
no.
no.
erm what is it two thirds the way across the page an angle of thirty degrees okay.
two thirds right should be about there yeah okay.
and then you go straight up say about er to about halfway up the page.
halfway up.
is there a disused monastery.
mmhmm.
there yeah.
so y-- right where you are at the moment's just like see where it says disused monastery right.
yeah.
you should just be about next to that where it says that.
okay right.
and do i go underneath it or above it.
and then.
over the top of it.
over the top.
okay.
round to my.
round and then and then li-- when you're round the side of that a l-- a straight line to about er maybe ten centimetres out from the side the left-hand side of the page.
six centimetres right.
do you have an alpine garden just above you.
uh-huh.
yes.
how does it go.
so you.
well.
it goes to the left of that.
to the left okay.
so and then you're up to the top of the alpine garden.
okay.
and then you go to your right about er five centimetres maybe.
okay.
and then straight up.
have you got a youth hostel.
no.
whereabouts is the youth hostel.
well.
it's sort of directly above the alpine garden except a bit to the right so eh.
slightly to the right okay.
directly above it how much.
well.
where are you just now.
erm about one centimetre from the side of the alpine garden that's above it and along one.
right.
go along a wee bit.
"until see the ""d"" of the alpine garden on the in between the ""d"" of the see where it says alpine garden."
yeah.
right.
"just look at that the d-- in between the ""d"" and ""e"" just put a straight line straight above that."
right.
okay right.

is there a telephone box there.
uh-huh so.
yeah just under the telephone box.
skirt round the bottom.
uh-huh.
yeah.
and then go straight up.
straight up to the east lake.
just about the top of the.
over the top of the.
no no.
just to the top of the telephone box.
see where the top is.
the top of the telephone box.
to level with that.
yeah okay.
and then er.
directions on er maybe north northwest for about er.
northwest.
until you're about a third of the way.
is there a level crossing there.
no no say that.
no.
right erm.
where you are you go northwest for about until there's about a quarter left on the page.
if you see what i mean.
okay northwest.
oh.
i have a level crossing just at this point.
well.
i don't know maybe go through that it's straight up after that.
straight up after that.
until you get to the bottom of the east lake and then you go to the.
have you got a finish.
okay right.
and then go to your left that sh-- should be you finished.
go to my left.
mmhmm.
until you get like the bottom part of the east lake erm you should just be like about.
okay.
three centimetres from that.
four centimetres maybe i don't know.
okay.
right.
that should be it finished.

right.
right.
should be a roman baths below the lake.
well i havenae.
well.
on mines there is.
and you come between the lake and the roman baths so you'll have to avoid them.
right okay.
and you want to come south and round the antelopes.
to the east or the west.

right.
ehm and go right underneath them.
mmhmm.
then travel to the east just past the antelopes.
mmhmm.

just past the antelopes it's finished.
mmhmm.
okay.
that's it.
right.
top left sandy shore.
okay.
down at the bottom of it bottom left of it follow the s-- line stream i presume it is to the top of the well.
you don't have a stream.
i don't have a well.
right.
do you have a well.
no.
right.
i've got the sandy shore and i've got a cross saying start.
right.
right okay.
now down slightly to.
down the middle or straight.
slightly sloped slightly sloped that way.
to the towards the west or east.
right.
east.
right okay.
but don't go down too far.
straight.
uh-huh.
and then.
you don't have a well.
no.
right.
so before does your stream turn to the right.
i don't have a stream.
you don't have anything.
are we talking about the top left.
yes.
right okay.
do you have anything.
no nothing at all.
is your page just blank.
no no.
but this bit up here is.
okay.
right down about three centimetres.
uh-huh.
and then slightly to the east that way and then turn to the west and like curve round like that except it'll be the other way.
okay.
and then.
after you finish the curve continue to the east.
do you have a house with local residents.
under crane bay.
yeah.
do you see this river coming down.
the big river.

okay never mind.
have you got hills.
yeah.
right.
where are you going above the hills.
above the hills.
to the east of that or what.
to the east of that.
nearly to the end of the hills.
i'm just going straight down there then.
no.
we're just going east.
have you passed like have you done the curvy bit.
well sort of yeah.
right.
and then sort of curve on to the east along the east.
how far down the page am i now.
okay.
ten centimetres.
east.
i just keep going east.
east.
to about couple centimetres off the top off the end of the hills.
we've probably got different hills.
okay that's me.
and.
then curve upwards.
mmhmm.
back to the stream to where you c-- to where you cross the stream.
this big thing.
do you have like two black lines and then a big stream.
right.
i'll tell you what i've got i've got this bit of water from where the start is.
okay.
uh-huh.
and i've got one big sort of river thing coming down and that's it.
right.
s--.
and then it splits into two.
you've got crane bay.
at the top.
mmhmm.
yeah.
uh.
right.
and you've got like the two bits round two lines round crane bay.
uh-huh.
so you cross that go up go back up and cross that.
how far down the river bit.
about two centimetres from where the two lines meet more sort of come into one.
describe what you've got.
right.
i've got i've got my forked stream on the page.
right.
have you got something saying forked stream.
i have.
halfway down.
right now go up to the left from that.
right.
okay.
follow the stream up.
but i thought we're starting at the top.
follow the stream to the fork.
yeah i know.
list-- i know this is me explaining what i've got.
oh alright okay.
on the page.
right.
and then when it gets to the top one bit of the stream goes up and one bit goes left and up.
one bit goes up.
it round crane bay.
mine just goes straight up goes like that into crane bay.
how do you cross it anyway.
have you got bridges.
no.
i don't have a bridge but maybe that's your bridge then that's how it's crossed.
you got a bridge.
up at the very very top at crane bay.
how many centimetres off the top of the page.
yeah that could be it.
but i've got a house just below that local residents.
yeah.
so have i.
so am i going on top of that or what.
mmhmm.
under it.
go up.
no.
round the round to the le-- the left of the house.
right okay.
and up to probably where your bridge is then.
right okay.
right.
and then you go right.
over the bridge.
over the bridge.
well i don't know i don't have the bridge but it looks over the bridge.
uh-huh.
have you another bridge no.
not that side.
up near where that one is no.
well keep going right for about four centimetres.
do you have a wood.
yeah.
you're roughly in line with the wood or slightly.
okay.
sort of nearly the middle of the wood but not quite down a bit.
in the middle.
mmhmm.
right.
now go down and round the forked stream.
quite a lot.
"round the forked stream 'til you come to like about the ""m"" in stream."
now.
do you have farmed land.
nope.
do you have a dead tree.
yeah.
right in like where two streams meet you have a dead tree.
uh-huh.
right.
to the right of that across the stream there's a big bit of farmed land.
right.
mmhmm.
about seven or eight centimetres along.
so what you've got to do now is like go round that.
in the between the farmed land and the stream or round the whole thing.
no.
round the farmed land.
right.
so way out to m-- east.
way out 'til about.
yeah.
to about two centimetres off the end the page.
okay.
then about four centimetres down.
mmhmm.
and then back in again.
about in line with this dead tree.
so you're just below the dead tree.
okay.
and then you cross the stream so's that you are actually below the dead tree.
i don't actually have anything to cross it with but.
neither do i.
that's okay.
right.
do you have pine grove.
yeah.
bottom right.
do you have a lagoon.
no.
oh where.
i've got green bay.
about the middle.
mm right.
oh yeah i've got lagoon yeah.
from where you are below the dead tree go straight down 'til you're in line with the lagoon.
straight down uh past the buried treasure.
which i don't have.
never mind.
okay.
and then go west 'til you nearly reach the lagoon.
right.
and then down round that to the bottom the tip of the lagoon.
right now.
do you have a rock fall.
no.
right you have green bay.
mmhmm.
do you have ehm.
right.
green bay is a bay right see the top point of green bay the outer point.
the westerly one.
yeah.
westerly point the top the end bit of land.
mmhmm.
that like comes to a point right.
the bit that looks a bit like india or something.
yeah mmhmm.
right.
so you come from the bottom of the lagoon and you're wanting to go there but the wee.
if you look in the top line of green bay there's like a wee dent in it.
mmhmm.
that's a rock fall of about three centimetres high.
okay.
so you have to come from the bottom of the lagoon over that and then down to the tip.
right.
'kay.
now.
just like cur--.
do you have a pirate ship.
yeah.
right yeah and.
you're meant to finish just at the front of the pirate ship so just like curve round.
over the water.
yeah.
anywhere in this pirate ship.
the the west the front.
aye okay.
and that's you.
right.
start top left yeah.
right.
no left.
okay.
right erm.
burnt forest right.
yeah.
right beside the start.
"go down diagonally so you're just next to the ""b""."
"just next to the ""b"" okay."
right.
diagonally.
yeah.
right.
yeah okay.
you should have something straight under the burnt forest.
yes.
a carpenter's cottage.
right.
we're going to the we're going to the l-- left-hand side of that.
okay.
left.
but don't do it yet.
right.
we're going to left-hand side.
right.
see the ravine right.
yeah.
see the bottom of the ravine right.
uh-huh.
and see the start.
yeah.
right.
we're going to the cross between vertical down start and horizontal.
right.
right.
right.
"from the start down to the ""b"" of the burnt forest right."
right.
then we're going to curve round to where the bottom of the ravine and the vertical from the start meet.
which direction.
curve round.
okay.
we'll want to curve round the ravine and where the bottom of this.
no curve curve.
see the start.
you want to be d-- y-- you're going to finish directly under the start.
right.
yeah okay.
opposite the bottom of the ravine.
opposite the bottom of the ravine so o--.
right.
so you're vertically under start but you're at the bottom of the ravine.
okay.
yeah.
and go round the side of the whatever you've got there.
carpenter's cottage.
right.
to the left.
okay.
to the left okay so.
on you go.
we slope down in between the carpenter's cottage and the ravine er beside the ravine slope down beside the ravine.
i don't have a carpenter's cottage i'm just.
no.
no.
like you'll you'll want to be directly under the start the starting cross right but you're opposite the bottom of the ravine.
okay.
opposite the bottom okay.
so.
you're still directly you want to end up directly under the start opposite the bottom of the ravine.
okay.
right okay.
right hold on.
right.
go along horizontally until you're about two centimetres away from the bottom of the ravine.
okay.
okay.
okay.
yeah.
right.
diagonally up to one centimetre above the top left of the ravine.
one centimetre above from the top okay.
okay.
now.
we're going horizontally along.
right.
right.
you've got pine grove haven't you.
yeah.
erm go along to the top right hand side of the ravine.
okay.
right.
and another two centimetres from that.
right.
now go diagonally down to the bottom left of the pine grove.
okay.
okay.
right.
you've got an avalanche somewhere haven't you.
yes er.
right.
see the concealed hideout.
mmhmm.
the right hand side.
yeah.
that's where we're trying to go.
okay.
okay.
so.
"if you sort of curve round an inverted ""s"" shape."
"an inverted ""s""."
"yeah well it's li-- like a ""2""."
right.
right.
so that you miss the avalanche.
miss the avalanche okay.
and end up at the bottom of the concealed hide-- well the side of the concealed hideout anyway.
okay.
okay.
right yeah.
now.
"curve round until you're under the ""c"" of concealed hideout."
"curve round 'til er i-- i'm just under the ""c""."
right.
then two centimetres further left.
yeah.
further left.
right.
okay.
left to whereabouts.
now.
so.
"you're now two centimetres to the left of ""c""."
just about underneath it.
"oh ""c""."
okay.
"is this along to l-- my left directly along two centimetres along from the ""c""."
yeah.
okay.
okay.
yeah.
right.
now.
see crane bay right.
yes.
"there's a there's a curved bit just above the letters crane er ""e"" ""b"" alright."
yeah.
"the curved bit right and see the peninsula around where ""r"" is above ""r"" the corner."
yeah.
"go vertically down and then follow the curve round until you get above ""r""."
okay.
"the ""r"" bit okay."
okay right.
"above ""r""."
right.
well on the on the on land.
on l--.
you're still on land aren't you.
yeah yeah it's alright i'm on land yeah.
you shouldn't be in the sea yet no right.
do you have a coconut palm.
no.
but you've got pebbled shore.
yeah.
now.
follow the coast round don't do it yet right follow the y-- we're going to end up above the middle of the pebbled shore.
right.
above the middle okay.
and follow the coast round but not too closely.
okay.
whereabouts is this.
but.
sort of.
coconut what was it you said.
erm.
you have to be quick.
follow the coast round.
right.
okay.
until you get horizontally above the pebbled shore.
right.
and then go along 'til you're above the middle of the pebbled shore.
okay right.
right now.
you've got some washed pebbles haven't you underneath the pebbled shore.
washed s-- yeah.
right.
go go.
hmm.
see the flagship.
yeah.
right.
don't do anything yet right.
see the flagship the bottom of the flagship right.
yeah.
along that is a line where the finish is right along that line.
yeah along this line.
t-- about two centimetres inland.
two centimetres inland okay.
along the line from the bottom of the flagship.
right.
that's where the finish is.
okay.
okay.
right.
don't do anything yet right.
now.
see you're at the s-- so-- top of the pebbled shore right.
yeah.
now.
go diagonally to the left-hand side of the page.
okay.
so that you miss the washed pebbles.
miss the washed pebbles.
but you should be.
to the left of them.
to the left of them.
yeah.
and you should be about a centimetre from the edge of the page.
yeah.
and come down vertically and curve in so that you end up at the finish mark.
okay.
big cross.
right.
and we're finished.
okay.
okay.
you're starting at the ehm.
left-hand side of the cliffs.
a--.
yeah.
i've got a start point.
right got start point.
mmhmm.
right.
"oh you're going to do a backward ""s""."
okay.
"you're going to do a backward ""s"" you."
right.
right.
you're going to go down slightly for about a centimetre.
"is this before or after the backward ""s""."
this is before it.
right.
"i'm explaining how to do the backward ""s""."
right.
go downwards.
for about a centimetre.
s-- for a centimetre right.
you're going to ehm.
follow ehm a line it's diagonal it's like a five o'clock line.
do you know what i'm talking about.
yeah.
and you're going by this time you should be just at the left-hand side at bottom of the cliffs.
right.
okay.
mmhmm.
going to do a half circle you're going to do it towards the page.
towards the end of the page.
mmhmm.
the opposite of an indifference curve if that's the way i could explain it.
so.
right okay.
okay.
so ehm.
would that starting at the bottom of the cliffs a half circle towards the left-hand side of the page.
uh-huh.
okay.
right.
right.
do you have a forge.
no.
no.
well.
you're going to do another circle.
uh-huh.
half circle it's as if you're going round something.
uh-huh.
right.
go round something imagine there's something there you're going to go round it you're going to head off towards the page.
right.
do a half circle and see when you come to the point just at the end of that half circle.
uh-huh.
are you at it.
yeah.
right.
head up in a diagonal lo-- line towards a one o'clock.
do you have an old pine.
yes.
head up to the top of that old pine.
right.
okay.
mmhmm.
now you're going to come down again at a slight slant just a slight slant right a slight slope.
down on the l-- the left or the right-hand side of the pine.
you're going to come down on the right-hand side of the pine.
right.
a slope towards the right.
uh-huh.
you're going towards the page.
right.
right.
not coming off it.
right.
do you have a pine forest.
right.
yeah.
right.
you're going to slope ehm down towards the pine pine forest but you're going to come closer closer to the pine forest when you're sloping.
do you know what i mean.
the gap between the path and the pine forest is getting smaller.
okay.
and then you should be at the bottom of the pine forest.
right.
okay.
right.
you're going to do another half circle towards the towards the right you're going out of the page right another half circle out of the page.
a half circle to the right.
uh-huh.
right.
so the outer circle's like s-- ehm is right across from the edge of the page okay.
okay.
do you have a bakery.
yeah.
okay.
go down slightly from that half circle just very very slightly.
uh-huh.
right.
you're going to head off again towards the right and go right round that bakery.
all the way round it.
all the way round.
are you at crane bay.
like see the the first peak in great crane bay.
are you opposite directly opposite f-- up from it.
ehm not yet.
but i will be in a minute.
right.
do that.
yeah right.
okay.
go straight down for about three centimetres.
see you come to that ehm curve in the bay.
you want to be about a centimetre away just from crane bay.
right.
right.
follow that curve round 'til you come to the second peak.
right.
okay.
are you at wheatfields.
no d--.
no.
i don't.
no.
no.
okay.
right you're going to head off towards a leftward ehm slant sloping down again.
how far down.
about three centimetres.
right.
okay.
go straight along for another three centimetres.
to the left.
to the left.
are you above a rocket warehouse.
yes.
okay.
right.
you're going to slants go to the end of the rocket warehouse if you know what i mean.
see how the top.
uh-huh.
of the rocket warehouse.
go to the end of that.
parallel to the the rocket warehouse.
uh-huh.
right okay.
right.
slope s-- slope down again to the left directly.
to directly to the left so to.
directly to.
to the left.
like you're sloping down like a seven o'clock line.
uh-huh.
okay.
to the left of the rocket warehouse.
uh-huh.
how far down.
ehm.
you should be about ehm six centimetres above the bottom of the page.
so below the rocket warehouse.
no.
you're at the left-hand side of the ro--.
s-- stop at the left.
you should be just an inch away from the edge of the page now.
yeah.
right okay.
uh-huh.
go straight down again for three centimetres.
uh-huh.
and then curve towards the old lighthouse.
round which side of the cave.
hmm i don't have a cave.
ehm go towards the lighthouse.
uh-huh.
ehm just slope towards it.
slope towards it.
you're forming another half circle again.
ehm a half circle towards.
the l-- old lighthouse.
right.
and that's you once you get to the old lighthouse.
right.
okay.
okay.
that's it finished.
okay ehm right.
take your line from the start and go vertically down past burnt forest.
right.
you have.
yeah i i've got a burnt forest.
but i've got a carpenter's cottage underneath that.
okay it's underneath.
right.
i want you to c-- i want you to take your line vertically down past burnt forest and past the carpenter's cottage right.
and just listen for a minute.
and then the carpenter's cottage is to the left of a ravine.
mmhmm.
i want you to take the line underneath the carpenter's cottage and then go vertically upwards through carpenter's cottage and the ravine.
between the two.
yeah.
yeah.
okay do that.
okay.
right.
okay now you're at the top of the ravine ehm.
is there a remote village above the ravine.
no.
i don't have a remote village.
okay.
well if you could just imagine that's above the ravine on a horizontal line with burnt forest.
right.
okay.
and go horizontally towards your right above the ravine.
right.
and where do i stop.
stop ah midway between the ravine and the pine grove.
right okay.
okay.
right.
now i want you to take that line go down towards pine grove just stop beside the writing pine grove.
right.
right with a vertical line straight down.
uh-huh.
right.
oh right and do you have any obstructions underneath the pine grove.
well there's an avalanche just to the right of it ehm and there's er a concealed hideout.
okay.
i want you to get to the concealed hideout.
just below there.
so ehm.
is the avalanche to the right or the left of the pine grove.
it's to the right.
to the right okay.
and just slightly below as well.
uh-huh.
well keep to the left-hand side of the avalanche draw the line downwards towards th-- slightly towards the right okay i want you to go really close to the avalanche but don't go past it and then keep that line going vertically downwards until you get just above the top of the concealed hideout.
right.
eh are you trying to az-- avoid an obstacle here.
i'm trying to avoid your avalanche but there's nothing here.
so does it oh how does it how does the line go does it go just like a straight line between just below pine grove to the hi-- concealed hideout or.
if you can draw that straight line without.
i can yes.
without.
mmhmm.
okay right that's fine.
without getting in the avalanche that's fine.
right.
s-- and eh i want to be just above.
just above the the peak of the concealed hideout.
right right.
okay that's fine right.
now i want you to go round ehm to your left of the concealed hideout.
is there a boat house.
no.
oh there's a boat house on the eh.
uh-huh but.
to the right and down.
i wa-- ehm i've got one to the left.
okay.
uh-huh right.
ehm so if you can imagine there's a boat house there so it's kind of like in the middle of the whole map.
right.
is it in the wee bulge eh just above crane bay.
it's above that directly above that.
right okay.
okay if you can imagine that's there i want you to go i want you to draw it round concealed hideout come to the to the right of concealed hideout.
okay.
right.
eh to the right of concealed hi-- hideout.
mmhmm.
so take that line that have you drawn and.
is this is just to the left is this a right on the map or a le-- a right o--.
okay.
the right of concealed hideout.
right.
and that.
and then continue the line underneath concealed hideout so you're drawing to the right and then underneath concealed hideout.
and underneath to the left do you mean like going from left to right underneath the concealed l-- hi-- hideout.
from right to left uh-huh.
from right to left right okay.
so i come round the the concealed hideout.
yeah.
from right to left.
right okay.
and then stop.
and then i go do i go down to that bulge yeah.
do you see the bulge.
it's like a it's an incline that goes down right the c-- the the coastline of crane bay comes up and it peaks at the top to the right of concealed to the left sorry of concealed hideout.
okay you see that.
and then it falls again there's a d-- a big dent in crane bay just above where it it actually says crane bay.
yes i see that right.
okay.
well i want you to draw the line from where you are just now and then if you could make it meet the coastline where that dent is.
right okay.
and i want you to follow it until it peaks again.
right i see you right.
so you're drawing a to a straight line between those two eh peaks.
well i want i-- you to actually follow it.
oh right.
to the right to curve round right.
to bay.
yeah uh-huh.
okay.
so eh i'm going for a straight line from concealed hideout to the first eh crest.
yeah.
and then do a curved line.
right okay.
yeah.
until you come to the next peak there.
right.
okay right.
from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to left.
okay.
but i want you to draw above.
have you got pebbled shore.
yes.
well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut palm.
there's no such thing on this map.
okay.
so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore there.
right okay.
so it's just a diagonal from that first crest to above pebbled shore.
uh-huh.
can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bit.
what you you mean curve.
can make it curve dow-- curve downwards a bit.
right so to make it curve above pebbled shore.
but s--.
yeah.
but still so that it's more following the the li-- the coastline again okay but coming away to go.
where where is the object eh you're trying to avoid.
it's a-- above pebbled shore.
it's.
to the right of pebbled shore just above.
above and to the right right i understand now i--.
is it ehm how far roughly is it from the the coastline.
ehm the same distance away as pebbled shore is away from the lower coastline.
right okay.
right so curve right.
okay.
what have you got below pebbled shore.
there's eh washed stones.
okay.
i don't have that.
i want ehm you see where the flagship is.
yes.
uh-huh okay.
in a horizontal line from the flagships okay imagine a line drawn there that's the finishing line about a centimetre away from the coastline.
okay.
to the left.
uh-huh.
and i want you to draw from where you are just now in a semicircular shape until you come horizontal with a line.
mmhmm.
beside the flagship can you do that avoiding whatever you've got underneath the pebbled shore.
ehm does this does this curve follow th--.
that's towards the right.
towards the left sorry.
does the curve follow the coastline or does it f-- go the opposite way.
f-- it goes towards the edge of the paper.
right ah right.
and the the f-- the finish is just to the is between.
it is to the left of the flagship.
the eh the flagship and the edge of the paper.
uh-huh.
about a centimetre away from the coastline.
right okay so.
okay.
okay.
okay.
have you found can you go to the start c-- ehm position please.
mm.
there's a black cross.
yeah.
right just below the start position there should be the site of a forest fire.
mm.
have you got that.
yeah.
if you could start from the black cross and go slightly to the left and then straight down ehm past the s-- to the side of the left-hand side of the forest fire the site of forest fire and keep going sort of down very near to the edge of the page until you come to a picnic site.
have you got a picnic site.
no i don't have that.
mm have you got an adventure playground.
yeah.
that's above to the right.
right okay.
could you keep don't don't go anywhere towards the p-- adventure playground just now.
okay.
jus-- could you go down from maybe the bottom you're still on the very very left-hand side of the page could you go down from the the writing that says site of forest fire.
yeah.
down about four inches on the side of the page just continue your path.
okay.
okay.
right.
and then can you stop about an inch from the bottom of the page.
okay.
and turn turn to the right hand side and go along maybe for about two inches just horizontally.
okay.
okay.
and then i'd like you to turn upwards to the direction of the adventure playground.
okay.
okay.
okay put and then just sort of skim along the edge of the adventure playground.
okay.
and you should see there's a sort of climbing frame.
mm.
c-- come up to the top of the climbing frame and then turn right.
okay.
okay.
right okay.
now.
have you got there's a 'til you're just sort of right tu-- if you turn right and continue along horizontally for about six inches.
okay.
you should have above you a granite quarry.
okay w--.
have you got this granite quarry.
yeah.
it's way above though.
yeah so that's okay it's supposed to be.
you're sort of you're horizon-- you're level with the adventure playground but you have to right wait a minute go along about six inches from the adventure playground and then directly up.
okay.
mmhmm.
okay.
towards towards the granite quarry.
okay.
and sort of turn right wait a minute you just sort of the right-hand side of the granite quarry can you go right up above the granite quarry.
yeah.
and then back down again.
i don't have you got any obstacles in your way.
ah right like directly diagonal from the adventure playground i've privately owned fields about four inches under the granite quarry.
mmhmm mmhmm.
but you haven't gone through them have you.
no.
okay.
right so.
if you continue going right up above the granite quarry.
okay.
you should come to a train crossing.
do you have the train crossing.
ah yeah.
but it's up on the far left of my paper so.
oh.
oh right.
there's t-- actually two on mine so if you uh you should have a granite quarry and then a waterfall well that's what i've got on my map.
yeah.
i have a waterfall to the left of the granite quarry.
yeah.
but on this map there's a train crossing.
so if you could come down you go up above the granite quarry and then back down again but not too far.
otherwise you'll pass through the train crossing in my map.
okay.
so if you keep going along just about half an inch below the waterfall and right up to the left han-- no.
right.
what i did at the top of the granite quarry was i made a right.
mmhmm.
oh no.
for around two inches.
or what should i have done.
you should have gone to the left.
okay.
sorry towards the waterfall sorry.
that's okay.
so then okay.
how far above the granite quarry should i go.
about couple of about half a centimetre.
and then go left.
yeah.
sort of over the granite quarry in the direction of the waterfall.
just if you keep about two centimetres below the w-- the writing that says waterfall.
do you okay keep below it.
mmhmm.
not too far though.
okay.
"and then if you go up to the ""w"" of the waterfall and then straight up just about couple of centime-- no a centimetre a-- away f-- to the left of wa-- the ""w"" of waterfall straight up to the top of the waterfall."
okay i see.
and when you get to the top of the waterfall oh you should just go up above the waterfall about five centimetres two inches.
okay.
and you should be n-- n-- you should be near to the train crossing in.
mm.
and cornfields.
yeah.
but don't just stay where you are just now.
now if you go to the.
if you can look back quickly at the granite quarry you should see a fallen cairn.
yeah.
i want you to go wh-- from where you are to just below the fallen cairn t--.
okay.
just go past underneath it though.
okay.
and then once you-- once you're past it can you turn back up to the left past and go up up the way towards the limestone cliffs keeping on the left-hand side of the limestone cliffs.
should i after the fallen cairns.
uh-huh.
should i just be going up straight.
erm sort of veer veer a bit to the left.
okay.
and then up above.
k--.
uh-huh.
okay.
and have you got limestone cliffs.
no.
but i think i've.
do you have lion country.
no i don't have lion c--.
i think that's i-- it's tha-- is where.
you are.
okay.
well sort of keep to the left of the lion country and keep going up the way for about from the fallen cairn oh no about five centimetres just keep going up past the lion country.
okay.
and you should come to an east lake.
okay.
just go along skim along the bottom of the east lake to the finish and that's you.
to the finish where's the finish.
oh no between the cornfields and the east lake.
oh okay.
about just directly in the middle and that's you.
okay.
okay.
your start and you've got a diamond mine beside it.
uh-huh.
and you've got a fast flowing river over the other corner.
uh-huh.
right.
so if you just circle round the diamond mine.
right.
and have you got a graveyard in the middle no of the fast flowing river and the diamond mine.
no i don't.
no.
am i am i going round the diamond mine and down.
just.
down no.
you're circling you're going down no just circling round it so that you end up with a horizontal line below the diamond mine you know circling round it.
oh right okay.
so i'm starting off going down and then right.
uh-huh.
right i see what you mean uh-huh.
that's the way you're going.
okay.
and it.
just right underneath the diamond mine.
mmhmm.
okay.
right and er.
i've got on my map i've got a graveyard in between them both exactly in between.
mmhmm.
right so.
if you imagine.
mmhmm.
that you have to circle round the graveyard you know to the right-hand side below and then round.
get that.
ehm.
so you're like really going just about vertically along to the right you know to where you imagine the graveyard is and you're going round it but then you're you're going round it then you're ehm going to your right above the fast flow-- the fast flowing river.
am i am i going round and above the graveyard.
no.
you're going below the graveyard and above the fast flowing river.
right.
right okay.
if you can imagine that know.
right.
and where do i go when i get to the the river.
ah you're circling round it.
right.
right okay.
and then you're going vertically downwards.
right.
have you got.
have you got an apache camp.
uh-huh.
right.
well you're going downwards and but you're going to the left of the apache camp so you're going vertically downwards and then your line's sort of going left.
right.
and have you got a carved wooden pole no.
no i don't.
that's just that's in the cen-- in the centre of the page just above the ac-- apache camp though.
okay.
so.
you have to avoid that so you're going down sort of.
h-- hold on i'm i'm kind of above the apache camp at the moment.
uh-huh.
right.
and wh--.
well.
you've to go past that.
right.
towards the centre of the page though.
right.
to.
just a straight line along.
no.
this is a curve a forty-five degree line i would say you know like you're from the the bottom of the fast flowing river.
right.
you're maybe coming down about an inch and a half vertically.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
and then it sort of curves at a forty-five degree line.
right.
to the middle of the page you know in line with the apache camp i would say.
okay done that.
right.
er see i've got i've got canoes kind of.
where are they.
they're just below the fast running creek.
right.
it's okay i've got you now.
right.
uh-huh.
so.
have you got a walled city.
uh-huh.
where's is that.
it's kind of off centre down a bit to the left.
mmhmm.
just below the apache camp you know.
yeah.
well.
more level.
uh-huh.
well.
you're you're coming right sort of you're going round the top of the walled city.
okay.
right so you've passed the apache pa-- you're above the apa-- apache camp and you're going round the top of the walled city.
mmhmm.
right.
and then you're sort of curving just curving basically it's kind of vertically you're going for a vertical kind of curve if you can say that for about maybe four inches down to you're coming down to about the bottom third of the page.
do you have a ghost town below.
a ghost town.
no.
no.
where's that where's the ghost town.
it's ehm directly underneath the walled city.
uh-huh right.
so.
you're pur-- you're circling round the ghost town.
right s--.
i'm going right down and round the ghost town.
uh-huh.
underneath.
under-- well yes uh-huh.
uh-huh.
i would imagi--.
and then you've got flat rocks over to the right-hand side.
uh-huh.
is that kind of maybe just a wee bit above the ghost town.
yeah.
right.
and you've got a stone creek below.
mmhmm.
so you're sort of going in between the two.
right.
you're curving round 'til nearly you're nearly up at the flat rocks.
okay.
your curve's going a way up.
right.
right.
and then you're going vertically down again you should be maybe just less than an inch off the right-hand side of the page.
right.
do you have a saloon bar.
where's that.
just underneath the flat rocks.
no.
no.
i've got a stone creek.
right.
and i i'm kind of above the stone creek at the moment.
have well have you.
haven't gone down yet wait a minute.
right.
so you've to go past the flat rocks you know below but you've to go over 'til you're really about an inch the from right-hand side of the page.
oh right okay.
right.
and down again.
and then down again.
right.
uh-huh.
how far down.
ehm take it.
have you got buffalo.
uh-huh.
just you're curving round the buffalo.
you're going vertically down then curving round the buffalo.
underneath the buffalo.
uh-huh underneath.
right okay.
right.
and then you've got a fort to the left-hand side at the bottom.
uh-huh.
and you've got the buffalo well in between i've got a cattle ranch.
no.
i don't.
you haven't.
right so like.
no.
what you've really got to do is avoid the cattle ranch.
okay.
which is really like in between the buffalo and the fort.
so what you have to do is go r-- circle round the buffalo and then go above the cattle ranch if you can imagine it there.
right uh-huh.
right.
do a bump it's in the centre of.
right okay.
and then you're going down below the fort.
right.
curving round below the fort that's at the bottom of the page.
uh-huh.
and then you're just curving up and the finish is maybe two inches from the bottom of the page up.
right got you.
that's it.
okay ehm right.
you have the start.
yeah.
right.
below the start do you have er like a missionary camp.
yeah.
okay.
well if you take it from the start just run horizontally.
uh-huh.
eh to the left for about an inch.
right.
and then go down along the side of the missionary camp.
uh-huh.
'til you're about an inch above the bottom of the map.
right.
then you need to go straight along for about 'til about you're about an inch and a half away from the edge of the map.
the banana tree.
okay.
do you have a banana tree.
i have gorillas that's probably the.
right okay.
i'll go round the banana tree.
yeah.
so you're at where are you now you're at the bottom.
i'm at the bottom.
okay.
now you you need to go parallel to the side of the map.
uh-huh.
ehm about four inches.
right.
so you're just ab-- y-- you're now about two inches above the gorillas or the banana tree.
yeah.
ehm do you have a rope bridge.
yes i do.
right.
you need to cross the rope bidge-- bridge.
how close to the river should i be the now.
i haven't got a i haven't got a river marked but i assume well i--.
i have gone.
you haven't.
if no.
if you go if you're up going up eh vertically.
uh-huh.
yeah.
by the gor-- gorillas.
then you need to-- you need to bend it round to the rope bridge.
then go horizontal.
bend.
and you're going across the rope bridge so your your line should stop at the beginning of the rope bridge and come out again at the end.
yeah.
yep okay.
right.
then you go down about an inch so you're coming down off the rope bridge.
to there's a river.
uh-huh.
okay.
now you need to run horizontally along.
right.
ehm do you have a waterfall.
yes i do.
you need to run horizontally along until you're just below the beginning of the waterfall.
right.
okay.
'kay.
now straight up.
do you have lost steps.
no.
oh yeah i do right up.
quite far up.
oh no.
th-- th-- th-- th-- th-- these are in the middle.
no.
okay.
we right.
you're at the bottom of the waterfall now okay.
uh-huh.
ehm what's your next thing that's marked.
the lost steps just south of the white mountain up at the top.
no the-- the-- they're not.
do you have the rock fall.
oh i've got another lot of lost steps up there that's what you must mean.
yeah.
no well.
in that case you need to go vertically upwards running parallel with the edge of the map.
how far.
uh-huh.
erm for about i don't know.
do you have gazelle gazelles.
or fallen pillars or flamingoes.
way up.
i have fallen pillars.
are they sort of in the middle of the map on the left.
yeah.
right.
well you need to go up but running vertically until you're about level with the fallen pillars.
uh-huh right okay done it.
now.
i've got some lost steps.
so you need to kind of curve round as if you had something in the way there you can't go straight across to the fallen pillars you've got to bend up a wee bit.
right okay.
you see.
up it like going over them.
like a-- like as if you were going over something.
right okay.
to the do i g-- bend it right over 'til i get to the fallen pillars.
bend it right over.
and then head it sort of up and round so that you-- you're going up over the lost steps.
uh-huh.
and then down and under the fallen pillars.
right hang on.
okay 'cause you can't go straight across on mine 'cause there's lost steps.
right okay yeah.
right.
so you're now underneath are you at the end of the fallen pillars now.
yes.
okay.
oops.
now.
ehm for some reason it loops round here again i don't there's nothing there though.
i've got flamingoes.
okay well that's why.
so you need to loop it round your flamingoes.
uh-huh.
and up so you.
to the ruined city.
do you have.
to the ancient ruins.
yeah.
t-- uh-huh.
so you need to go loop it down and then all the way up to the ancient ruins.
right.
okay.
i'm at the ancient ruins.
you're at the ancient ruins.
okay.
now bend round the ancient ruins until you're just now running verti-- so you're just going up from the ancient ruins now.
have you got some stones at the top.
i've got rock fall.
okay.
right.
if you head it up towards the rock fall.
s-- right i'm.
so you now you now should be about two two and a half inches from the top of the map.
right.
yeah practically.
okay.
then.
so you're at you're at the stones now.
yeah.
okay now straight across have you got the white mountain.
under the stones.
yes i've got the white mountain.
under the stones.
so you go straight across towards the white mountain.
uh-huh.
and then climb the white mountain and go back down the other side.
have you got some soft furnishings store.
right.
where.
underneath uh.
just in the corner.
no.
no.
right underneath the white mountain.
no.
okay.
well you've go-- so you're at the bottom of the white mountain now.
yeah.
right er.
this is difficult um.
yo-- what about the lost steps up there.
do you have lost steps on that side.
no.
you don't go anywhere near them.
right okay.
no.
well.
you're now going you're going back the way you came so you need to it-- as if you're going right underneath the white mountain so come down a bit and then go right underneath it.
okay right.
about to about three inches.
right.
and now straight drop down.
do you have gazelles.
yes.
right.
straight drop down towards the gazelles.
right there.
underneath the gazelles.
right.
about three inches to the right.
right.
just and that's the end.
okay.
because you come underneath the gazelles and then you go.
and then you go right.
go go right.
and you stop on on nothing there's there's no mark there.
'kay.
there's a cross now.
okay that's the end.
erm we're start oop-- starting down.
that's the end of that.
erm starting above the telephone kiosk.
uh-huh.
and we're going on the let's see left-hand side of that as i'm looking at it and come directly down.
uh-huh.
below the stone circle and we come up.
i don't have a stone circle.
you don't have a stone circle.
no.
ah.
right okay.
if you come down almost to the bottom of the map that i've got.
uh-huh.
to to the left of the telephone kiosk.
yes.
to my what was my left as i'm looking at it here.
right.
okay.
erm and come directly down.
yeah.
and almost to the bottom.
uh-huh.
and then come across.
hmm.
do you have a farmer's gate.
no.
i have a broken gate.
ah right okay.
erm come across as far as that but still at the bottom.
yeah i've got it.
and then head up towards the left-hand side of the gate.
right.
i've gone a bit too far then.
okay.
right.
come across a-- th-- come round and across the top of the gate.
yeah.
erm and walk above steadily or gradually heading upwards but only slightly up to above the meadow if you've got that.
yeah.
but the meadow's below my broken gate.
right yes.
but come over the broken gate and then head over towards that.
that's it.
yeah.
erm once you're above that head upwards to the right-hand side of the ruined monastery if you've got that.
that's m-- away up.
mmhmm.
head up to the right-hand side of that but avoiding the the dead tree.
yeah w--.
have you got a.
if you'll erm come above that over towards the left-hand side.
right.
yeah.
round down towards the top of the west lake.
i don't have a west lake.
you don't have a west lake at all.
no.
i've got i've got an east lake but i haven't got a west lake.
oh.
have you got a stile.
i've got a stile yes.
is it anywhere near that.
it's j-- it's directly below that.
uh-huh.
erm if you come d-- just loop down below the stile and round to the left-hand side.
right.
then come up across it to the far side of the the drawing of the stile or the stile erm head upwards erm on the map it's maybe about an inch.
yeah.
if i'm allowed to use that.
erm and then head diagonally down towards the bottom of the dead tree.
i have don't have a dead tree i have a dutch elm.
erm it whereabouts is that is that on.
it's r-- far eh way over on the right-hand side about just up from the middle of the map.
right okay well that i well i assume that's the same thing.
is it about right.
have you got a popular tourist spot.
erm no i haven't.
'cause at the moment if i head diagonally i i bump into the popular tourist spot.
i've got.
oh.
i've got a great viewpoint eh above the tree eh just below the east lake.
oh no.
i've got a rocket launch just b-- just below the east lake.
erm well.
are we heading towards the dutch elm then.
i would say so yes.
yeah okay right i suppose that.
and head down below that.
right okay right.
now loop round that on the right-hand side.
yeah got it.
and come over gradually to the far to the left-hand side of the tree.
yeah.
sloping slightly upwards.
yeah got it.
and then come round.
well i've got a great viewpoint here just below the east lake.
oh i've got a great viewpoint right in the top left-hand corner.
i've got that as well.
ah okay.
so like.
erm what have you got underneath the east lake.
rocket launch.
well i think we'll need to ass-- assume that's.
yeah.
to be avoided anyway.
so if you come round to the right-hand side of that and head upwards towards the east lake.
yeah.
so i just come round on top of the dutch elm.
right.
you're above the e-- the elm.
on the left-hand side.
on the left-hand side if you head directly upwards towards the east lake on the right-hand side.
okay.
oh oh it's on the right-hand side of my great viewpoint.
okay yeah.
right eh.
go almost to the edge of the lake.
yeah.
and then head eh left.
right.
so i'm i'm i'm g-- like on the bank on the bank of the east lake.
uh.
yeah.
maybe slight-- just slightly back from it but above what i've got as a great viewpoint.
okay.
yeah.
and that's my the finish.
that's it.
yep yep.
right.
so what-- what would we end just underneath the east lake do we.
right.
ehm do you have the start yeah.
uh-huh right.
and the diamond mine.
in the up at.
uh-huh.
up at the top to the left of the diamond mind.
yeah.
mine right.
ah right.
"if you come down to the just below the ""d"" in the diamond."
okay.
straight down.
yeah.
and then along.
do you have the springboks.
no.
no.
do you have the highest viewpoint.
uh-huh.
over in the right.
uh-huh.
yeah.
right.
if you move up very slightly to the right along to the right.
yeah.
did i say that yeah.
up very slightly to the right.
right wait a minute.
i'm go-- i've to go along the bottom of the diamond diamond mine first.
uh-huh yeah.
right.
yeah.
so i'm.
right.
"ehm from the ""e"" in mine."
uh-huh.
i go another maybe six centimetres in the same direction.
mmhmm.
and then move if you move around and up to the left almost vertically but not quite.
around.
uh-huh.
to.
so right i'm i'm at the moment i'm about halfway between the diamond mine and the highest viewpoint.
yeah right.
if you go along another maybe two or three centimetres then.
right.
and then up and around to the left almost vertically but not quite.
right oh.
'til you get to about level with the bottom of the mountain or hill.
oh right okay mmhmm.
okay.
and then just move around the top about a centimetre space between the your route and the mountain if you just go right around to the.
so wait a minute i'm going right round the top of the mountain then.
uh-huh uh-huh.
a cu-- just curving right round.
yeah.
until you get to the bottom of the mountain at the right-hand side.
you got that yeah.
uh-huh.
right.
now move down about f-- six centimetres.
just just ver-- straight down.
just vertically down yeah.
have you got the overgrown gully.
no.
all right.
have you got the safari truck.
yeah.
and if when you stop you should be about two centimetres above the safari truck.
to the right of it.
oh r--.
yeah.
yeah.
right.
right.
and move down about forty-five degrees to the left.
do you have the field station.
no oh.
no.
if you move down about seven centimetres to the left.
right.
going across the top of the safari truck.
yeah yeah.
so going down but to the left at the same time.
mmhmm.
when you stop you should be about two centimetres from safari truck and a wee bit below it.
right.
okay.
and now just move along to the left.
in what way horizontal straight across.
yeah.
do you have the banana tree.
uh-huh.
right.
if you move along and round the top of that.
right okay.
so is it straight across.
mmhmm.
and then round.
the top of the banana tree.
and down on the left-hand side of it.
mmhmm.
for about twenty centimetres.
all right.
so a good bit down then.
yeah.
have you got the.
do you have the gold mine.
no.
no.
yeah.
about twenty centimetres then.
i've got the rock fall.
have you got that.
no.
oh.
right eh right just that's quite a lot then twenty centimetres i draw the line.
where.
right.
have you got the great lake.
no i don't have.
oh right.
yes sorry i do.
ehm.
so i'm am i still a good bit above the great lake.
you're about i'd say about ten fifteen centimetres above the great lake.
right okay.
okay.
right ehm.
if you move along.
do you have the rope bridge.
ehm uh-huh.
i've got one over at the right about halfway down the page.
uh-huh that's right.
if you move along horizontally about three or four centimetres.
mmhmm.
and then once you've done that move up to the rope bridge just from where you are to the rope bridge and then cross it.
sort of diagonally.
right.
right.
do you have the giraffes.
uh-huh.
i've also got some crocodiles.
ehm once you've crossed the rope bridge if you move out in the same direction.
mmhmm.
curving round a little to maybe two centimetres or so.
right.
mmhmm.
and then move vertically down to the giraffes.
right.
okay.
so i'm at the the right of the giraffes.
mmhmm.
okay so.
what do i do now.
"ehm you sh-- you should be around about at the ""s"" in giraffe about a centimetre below it."
okay.
and then curve round slightly for about four five centimetres.
what going going left.
going left sorry yeah.
so curving up the way.
no curving down.
right.
have you got the disused warehouse.
no i don't.
right.
am i going quite near the bottom of the page here then.
no.
once you once you've moved you should be about maybe five centimetres from bottom of page.
and start to curve up the way instead but still going left.
right.
i think i'm probably to go underneath the warehouse then.
mmhmm.
right.
and move that down almost vertically down but not quite for about two centimetres.
wait a minute where am i in relation to the great lake now then well i mean.
you should be about.
at the moment i'm about level with the great lake but about th-- two three centimetres to the right of it.
mm that's about okay.
right.
if you come down so you're about a centimetre below the great lake and just move underneath the great lake.
so i'm going back down again.
oh right go underneath it.
so just straight across then to the left.
straight across.
"until you get to the ""g""."
s-- i'll just score that wee bit out then.
uh-huh.
and if you curve up to the left ehm about five centimetres.
do you have the rock fall.
uh-huh.
right.
you should you should finish about two centimetres below the rock fall and about five centimetres to the left of the rock fall.
right.
that's the finish then.
yeah.
right.
right.
so the start is at the top left-hand side of the page.
uh-huh.
do you have cliffs just to to the right.
to the right uh-huh.
stas-- sandstone cliffs.
mmhmm.
do you have a forge below the cliffs about you know an inch or so down two inches maybe.
er no.
you don't have a forge.
well.
the forge is eh below the c-- the cliffs say about two inches down.
okay.
so you go from the start slightly to your right down the way right a curve.
uh-huh.
how far down.
to the bottom of the cliffs.
right.
and then you start to go left go about half an inch out to the left and d-- and down about you know two and a half inches three inches.
s-- so how far am i from the left of the page.
an inch and a half.
if you draw that line down you'll be on the left-hand side of the forge you don't have a forge but there is one there.
right.
so now you're about.
no hold on a minute.
you should really end up about four inches down from the the cross er you know in the same line like just beneath it in fact fo-- four inches down.
okay.
right.
hold on wait a minute.
am i right under the sandstone cliffs.
no no.
no.
no.
the initial line from th-- the cross.
mmhmm.
goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs.
right okay.
it goes down to where it says cliffs.
okay.
uh-huh.
about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're ab--.
right.
straight down under the start.
yeah.
right.
until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start.
okay.
do you have an old pine.
uh-huh.
in the right kind of towards the middle a bit.
yeah.
a single old pine.
uh-huh.
w-- and down down as far as that.
okay.
right.
but you know beneath the start.
uh-huh.
so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine.
okay.
right.
right up over the pine.
over the pine.
and i go right as far as the pine.
yeah more or less.
if you see what i mean.
as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to.
oh.
worry too much about the exact.
okay.
i don't have a forge anyway.
route but eh.
right.
up.
right.
so y-- once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right.
have you got a pine forest.
uh-huh.
you have.
well.
just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest.
am i and am i going straight kind of along the outline of the bay.
you've got a bay there.
uh-huh.
i don't have a bay there.
it'll be at the top.
uh-huh.
have you got a bay at the bottom.
yeah.
crane bay.
uh-huh.
where's the one at the top.
it's just in the centre of the page at the top very top.
how far down.
erm about an inch and a half.
yeah well.
don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but th-- the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest.
uh-huh.
okay.
okay.
once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine.
mmhmm.
okay.
if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until.
have you got wheatfields.
no.
on your map.
no well the.
oh yeah uh-huh.
you have right.
mmhmm.
well.
just draw the arc and stop the arc t-- you know in line with the wheatfields but beneath the pine forest.
okay.
i.
don't understand.
say that again.
oh two or three inches down from the pine forest.
okay you know.
it doesn't have to be an arc as long as you avoid all the obstacles i think eh if you you know if you finish up eh in line with the wheatfields.
okay.
but beneath the pine forest you if you stop drawing your line there.
above the bakery in other words ab-- above the eh th-- th-- th--.
whe--.
where is your wheatfields.
well er you know.
ca-- imagine where the forge would be on your map or it's o-- it's on mine but imagine where it would be.
mmhmm.
about two inches down from that in in between the the forge and the old pine.
right.
on the left-hand side.
okay.
so.
where are you now.
right.
i'm going down past the pine forest in an arch towards the wheatfields.
mmhmm.
no no no.
no.
no.
don't worry about the wheatfields it's just to tell you where to stop the line.
right okay.
never mind about it being an arc or a curve or anything.
okay.
just just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest.
right.
okay.
and once you get to the where it says pine draw a line from there to eh above the bakery but not the chimney a bit to the left of that in fact the left-hand side it must be a wee shed or whatever it is.
right.
you see what i m--.
and i'm going s-- am i going straight down.
yeah.
but stop when you get just to above the bakery.
uh-huh.
right okay.
then just go round the bakery on the right-hand side just draw a an oval shape round the right-hand side of the bakery.
i'm go-- i'm going down and round.
yeah.
right round it uh-huh.
uh-huh.
right.
now where.
underneath the bakery.
uh-huh.
have you got a canal.
no.
no.
well.
the canal is about two inches to the left-hand side of the bakery but it's in line with it.
so once you get an inch or and a half or so past the bakery.
mmhmm.
eh take your line down to crane bay.
oh i've got two wheatfields that's not important is it right anyway w--.
so you get to the canal right you don't have one but g-- just go down about two inches until you get to crane bay and follow follow the curve.
okay.
of crane bay.
uh-huh.
right round to the left.
but not don't go down just go along don't go dow-- don't go down where it it really curves away there don't don't follow that.
right.
okay.
so you're at the top le-- left-hand side of crane bay right n-- just northwest of where it says crane.
uh-huh.
"or the s-- where the ""c"" is."
uh-huh.
i've got wheatfields in line with where it says bay okay about an inch or so to the left of crane bay itself just in line in fact beneath where the other wheatfields were that i that i was telling you about.
mmhmm.
right okay.
okay.
so y-- you go round the round that curve and you have to go down and about an inch and a half.
okay.
to a-- to avoid the wheatfields which are just to the left of crane bay so you go down there.
right.
hmm.
go beneath the wheatfields in other words draw a line you know two inches or so to the left.
have you got a rocket warehouse.
uh-huh.
well.
just draw a line between well above the rocket warehouse in fact.
okay.
uh-huh.
an in-- an inch or so above the rocket warehouse but to the left of it go round it the same way as you went round the igloo but on the other side.
okay.
just follow it round.
yeah.
okay.
go down the left-hand side of the page once you've done that.
uh-huh.
have you got a lighthouse.
yeah.
kind of directly underneath the warehouse.
the rocket warehouse.
uh-huh.
the cross is right next to the lighthouse and just take your line to there and that's it finished.
it's right next to the lighthouse.
on the left-hand side of it.
right okay.
and just go straight down.
well y--.
yeah that would be okay.
uh-huh.
uh-huh and just the cross is right you know the left-hand side of the lighthouse just next to it.
okay.
okay got it.
mmhmm.
right that's it finished.
okay.
shall we begin now.
okay.
okay.
ehm shall we call eh north ehm the top of the page.
right okay that's fine.
okay.
ehm go straight down south past the diamond mine 'til you get just to where the words diamond mine start.
mm okay.
"go round ehm horizontally underneath diamond mine and along past the graveyard sort of up in a sort of slightly diagonal line to where the ""d"" is in the graveyard."
okay.
eh graveyard.
have you got the graveyard written down.
no i don't have a graveyard on this one.
do you have diamond mine.
yes i've got a gold mine.

i see mm that's interesting.
ehm oh dear.
ehm do you have a graveyard.
no no graveyard.
got eh carved stones at the top of the page.
and directly below the diamond sorry just beyond diamond mine below the diamond mine is the gold mine.
right.
so you've got a diamond mine and a gold mine.
sorry yes yes the diamond mine we've just gone past.
right so we're down past the diamond mine.
yeah.
and along underneath the diamond mine.
yes.
along.
ehm could we ehm up we want to go north through the graveyard and round and a-- above the carved stones.
above the carved stones okay.

right.
sort of d-- do you have a great rock.
yes got a great rock.
yeah.
you want to go between the indian country and the great rock and actually diagonally so you're underneath the great rock.
right.
so going down to indian country.
uh-huh.
and then up diagonally.
above indian country.
above indian country.
diagonally down to un-- h-- horizontally underneath the great rock.
okay.
okay i--.

mm ehm underneath the trout farm i've got some.
so if you go ehm horizontally 'til about an inch from the end of the page.
right.
and straight down 'til about two inches from the bottom of the page.
do you have cattle stockade.
yes.
right.
straight down 'til you get to that and then underneath it.
right.
do you have bandit territory.
okay.
yes got a bandit territory.
right.
along.
eh af-- are you underneath the cattle stockade.
yes.
ehm if you go sort of up a sort of a t-- a hill.
have you got a.
have you got a parched river bed.
no i don't.
right i better not avoid that.
yeah.
but if you just just stay p-- we're just at the.
we're nearly finished.
ehm if you go under cattle stockade and then loop up slightly and then down under bandit territory.
right.
okay.
and up t-- eh up from bandit territory to finish.
i don't have a finish marked on mine.
right.
okay ehm bandit territory go to your left of bandit territory and just above it put a cross for finish.
right.
right.
so just above bandit territory.
ehm about well i'd say about eh an inch and a half left from bandit territory just above it.
okay.
that's where the finish is.
okay.
paul we're starting top left.
right you've got a diamond mine.
i've got a diamond mine.
okay.
"okay drop s-- straight down to the ""d"" of."
right that's okay right okay right.
okay.
this is very difficult.
"drop drop straight straight down the side of the diamond mine to to the ""d"" of diamond mine."
okay.
okay.
just below it.
just below it yeah.
and then you're going to go right drawing a line underneath diamond mine.
pen's.
hold on hold on my pen's run out oh no it's working.
okay you're going to draw you're going to underline diamond mine.
underline it right.
"so right underline it along to the ""e""."
"und-- underline it un-- underline it along to the ""e""."
of diamond.
pen's not working very well.
okay.
right.
"right and continue the line until you're until you're directly below the ""h"" of highest viewpoint."
of highest viewpoint.
right.
so i've just got an an east line a right-hand a line going thr-- to the right all the way from.
a line going.
"going to the right towards the ""h"" and stop at the ""h"" undernea-- under unde-- un-- no underneath the ""h"" don't."
okey-doke.
okay.
but i'm out.
just go s-- go right don't go up yet.
right.
"i'm about two centimetres from the ""h"" below it."
"yeah you're below the ""h"" yeah."
right below it okay.
okay.
then go straight up to the seagulls.
straight up to the seagulls.
which one the top one.
there's see how there's seagulls on the top left of the mountain there.
okay.
"just g-- just bypassing the just skirting the ""h"" go straight up to the seagulls."
okay.
okay.
and then turn right and and go along the the t--.
so i'm just going over the top of the hill.
going over the top of the mountain yeah.
right okay.
to the other two wee seagulls.
yeah.
and it's a curve or a straight line or.
just uh whatever you like it doesn't matter as long as we miss the mountain.
slight curve.
okay.
okay.
ehm have you got a safari truck.
yes i have.
you have got a safari truck.
below an overgrown gully.
right.
you've not got an overg--.
where's your where's your field station.
where's my field station.
across from the safari truck at the opposite side of the page virtually the same pa-- position.
how it's virtually the same position.
virtually the same position the other side left-hand side of the page just up slightly.
it's up slightly.
aye just slightly aye.
okay right.
a centimetre up.
right what what you've got to do here is you've got to drop down towards the safari truck.
y-- okay.
which side of the safari truck.
ehm drop down 'til until you're.
towards the right-hand side of it or towards.
right wait a minute let me see.
the the safari truck i think it it looks like a steering wheel on the right-hand side.
the right-hand side.
can you see it.
is it sort of handlebar type thing.
right see the see the right-hand see the right-hand wheel.
yes.
drop down towards that.
right okay but.
and and stop just just above the safari truck.
am i draw--.
so i'm at the right-hand side of the highest viewpoint at the moment.
okay and.
yeah uh-huh.
and you're dropping straight down.
straight down right.
so i'm going to go through an overgrown gully.
oh right okay.
right skirt the overgrown gully and come.
right.
skirt it to the left or right.
'cause i i don't have an overgrown gully.
okay.
so skirt it and co-- and come back so that you're directly above the right-hand wheel of the safari truck.
okay.
"right above where that wee ""t"" sort of handlebar type thing is."
yeah yeah that one yeah.
of the safari truck.
right okay.
got it uh-huh.
i know where i'm going.
okay.
okay.
i'm right above the.
right you're.
right you now need to turn left.
okay i'm directly in line with the field station at this.
right that's fine okay.
"you you want to turn left and head towards the field station but don't right wait a minute and and stop when you are at er when you're directly below the ""t"" of highest viewpoint the the f-- ""t"" of highest."
right okay.
stop direct--.
so just doing a straight line.
straight line uh-huh.
so i'm just at the other side of the safari truck now the left-hand side of it.
okay.
just a wee bit about a centimetre away from there.
yeah.
yeah fine.
okay.
ehm.
okay now.
you're ov--.
aye just wait a minute i'm just at a complete blank where we are.
right we're.
eh we're just at the safari truck the top left-hand corner of it.
you're just at the l-- you're just at the left of the.
right okay.
ehm you.
"under ""t""."
you don't have a field station in the middle do you.
no i don't.
you've got a banana tree.
i've got a banana tree.
yeah.
right.
right.
drop down 'til you're level with the top of the leaves of the banana tree d-- you're coming straight down and the banana tree is on your left.
right.
okay.
so i'm going straight down.
straight straight down until the to.
due south directly.
until due south until you come level with the top leaves of the banana tree.
okay.
okay.
and then go across and round the top of the banana go left to across and round.
right okay.
so quite a quite a long line.
round the top.
yeah.
round the top.
around the top of the banana tree.
okay.
and down the side of it.
okay.
and we're going down the side.
right so i'm going south down the side.
you're going south.
now you can come directly down.
have you got a gold mine.
no i certainly haven't.
no you don't.
have you got a rock fall at the bottom.
i have yes.
right okay.
come down nearly to the top of the rock fall.
just straight down south there's a massive line going south.
strai--.
massive line going south.
so it's a c-- ni--.
nearly to the nearly to the top of the rock fall.
and the same line as the start to the bottom of the diamond line mine at the very beginning.
yeah that's right uh-huh yeah yeah.
right.
that one.
straight down to the rock rock f-- at the bottom of it.
down at you're at the bottom of the rock fall.
no no sorry.
top of the rock fall.
right okay top.
okay.
and now take a diagonal to the rope bridge and you're going to go across the rope bridge.
right.
so i'm going up sort of north northeast.
yeah.
right.
so i'm going just a straight line up.
and just a straight diagonal line up t-- up to the rope bridge.
and across the rope bridge.
and then across it.
right i'm at the other side of it now.
okay right.
now i've got giraffes and.
right.
i've got crocodiles in between.
you've got crocodiles.
so obviously you need to miss the the you need to miss the crocodiles and you need to go round the giraffes.
and the giraffes are at er my giraffes are the very bottom right.
right.
that's where mine are.
and.
mmhmm.
you basically you you've got to go to the right of the giraffes.
right.
to the right.
now i'm so i'm at the top right i'm at the right-hand side of the rope bridge at the moment.
uh-huh.
so i'm going to go down.
basically what you're doing on my map you're dropping nearly straight down.
right okay.
going to the right very slightly and a-- and skirting the giraffes the gir-- the.
okay.
right i'm just going through the side of the crocodiles right 'cause i presume that's what oh no i'm i'm c-- i'm cutting his head off eh i'll go round that right there you are i've done a wee circle.
just go round them.
right.
i'm going down to the right of the giraffes.
right past the giraffes the third giraffe's tail.
yeah fine.
right okay.
where from there.
okay ehm.
down to the bottom of the giraffes.
right what what i've got here is i've got a great lake.
mmhmm.
so have i.
and that's the final that's the final obstacle on my map.
right okay.
so i'm at the bottom of the giraffes just now.
so.
you're at the bottom of the giraffes.
"i'm in line with the letter ""s"" of giraffes that's where my last line is."
s--.
yeah that's fine.
right basically the gr-- the great lake's down at the bottom.
mmhmm.
left-hand side.
so you.
basically all you have to do is head left towards the the bottom of the great lake and go underneath the great lake.
right okay.
okay.
now i've got a disused disused warehouse in between the giraffes and the great lake.
so i.
well.
so how should i s--.
my line be about.
is it is it above it or below it.
it's to the right-hand side of it.
it's the right sai-- hand side.
well i would go above the disused warehouse.
uh-huh.
right okay so i'm s--.
uh-huh i see where you're going.
okay.
and i'm going to the bottom of the great lake so i'm sort of doing a a squiggly line.
yeah that's right uh-huh.
right okay.
above the disused warehouse below the great lake.
okay.
i'm below the great lake just now.
and.
finishing level with th-- the c-- come u-- straight up towards the field station.
right okay.
finishing level with the giraffes' kneecaps.
the giraffes' kneecaps.
see the giraffes' kneecaps.
oh god i've my field station's away up at the top of the page.
se--.
finish at that finish.
no don't go right up to the field station just.
no you you shouldn't not as far as that.
right.
giraffes' kneecaps and that's the finish.
giraffes' kneecaps and that's the finish.
right.
i've gone a wee bit too far but i'll scrub that out.
okay.
finish very good that was good neil.
right.
so you're at the start.
uh-huh.

right.
head downwards.
mmhmm.
go right down underneath the picnic site.

"right this is melanie and valerie and the number is ""n"" ""a"" ""q"" three ""c"" three minus plus one ""a"" ""f""."
right so we're at the start.
mmhmm.
and head down towards the bottom of the page going past the left of the site of forest fire.
right.
go down and go underneath the picnic site.
uh-huh.
"and come back up the other side making a ""u"" round it."
mmhmm.
and then keep going up past the left-hand side of the adventure playground.
mmhmm.
ehm turn to the right just past the adventure playground.
mmhmm.
and go across towards just past centre of the page.
right.
okay.
mmhmm.
and then turn up and go northwards for a bit 'til you reach the granite quarry.
mmhmm.
ehm go round the top of the granite quarry curve round it.
above it or below it.
above it.
curve round it.
right.
and then ehm come down like after you've curved round it on the downwards bit.
mmhmm.
go along the top of the train crossing.
mm.
my train crossing's at the very top of the page.
ah.
well mine's.
where is it how far away from the granite quarry is it.
eh no very it's right next to it.
ah above it or below it or right beside it.
just slightly below it.
on the left-hand side.
mmhmm.
okay.
so i'm going underneath it.
above it.
right.
and then you'll be underneath the waterfall.
that's right.
and go up the left-hand side of the waterfall in a straight line.
mmhmm.
and then turn to your right.
mmhmm.
and go for about an inch.
and then turn upwards again.
have you got public footpath.
no.
oh right okay.
go up for a wee bit.
right.
and then turn to your right.
uh-huh.
and then come down in a slight slope well a fairly slopey slope.
okay.
down to the fallen cairn.
that's miles away isn't it.
on the right.
eh i've got lion county directly on the right.
well come down in a slope to about half-- halfway down the page in a diagonal line.
mmhmm.
to your right.
uh-huh.
and then go underneath.

ehm go left when you reach east lake.
right.
and the finish is just to the left of it.
have you got cornfields.

the start's at the top left.
right aye i've got the start marked down.
you have cliffs there.
sandstone cliffs.
yeah.
mmhmm.
you don't have a forge do you.
no.
right.
there's a forge about two inches beneath the cliffs.
okay.
right.
directly down.
yeah.
besi-- is it beside an old pine.
yeah.
it's about you know an inch or so two inches from to the left of the old pine.
so if you just take a line straight down from the start.
okay.
uh-huh.
so ju-- hang on you see this ehm.
four inches down four inches down just take a straight line.
well is this is this next to the.
is it beside the old pine sort of or is it on a sort of.
no.
just draw a straight line down from the start four inches or so first of all.
right.
okay.
you don't have a forge there but you know that's that's beneath the forge.
where it is.
okay.
right.
then go right to the bottom of the old pine.
mmhmm.
go up and round the old pine.
mmhmm.
you've got a bay at the top haven't you.
a bay a green bay.
uh-huh.
i don't have a bay there but.
oh right.
if you just get to the so you know if you just go round the old pine.
okay.
uh-huh.
once you get to the top.
mmhmm.
go two or three inches to the right 'til you get to the pine forest.
okay.
mmhmm.
round to green bay.
go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest.
the left-hand side right.
mmhmm.
draw a line straight down.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
until you get to just about a centimetre or or two northwest of the bakery.
okay.
in other words the more or less the top left-hand side of the bakery but a an inch or so above.
right mmhmm.
so then you go just go round the bakery in an oval shape.
okay.
right round it on the right-hand side.
right.
right.
and you don't have a canal do you.
no.
the canal's about two inches to the left of the bakery.
bu-- so go round the bakery.
mmhmm.
and stop about an inch to the left of the bakery.
mmhmm.
then draw a line straight down.
mmhmm.
to where crane bay starts to curve above abo-- above the gap but it's between crane and the word bay.
right.
okay.
mmhmm.
so draw a line straight down to there follow that curve to the left.
mmhmm.
until crane bay curves quite steeply away.
down.
mmhmm.
but don't go don't go round there.
okay.
right mmhmm.
so then do you have wheatfields down there next to the bay.
no.
i've got them up beside the old pine.
yeah.
but you don't have to worry about those right now.
no don't have them.
okay then.
i've got wheatfields in line.
have you got a rocket warehouse.
yeah.
i've got wheatfields in line with the word bay about say an inch to the left-hand side of the bay.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
so if if where are you now top left-hand side of crane bay.
uh-huh.
just draw a line two inches down or in fact just draw a line down until an inch or so above the rocket warehouse.
right.
okay.
go round the rocket warehouse in the same way as you went round the bakery but o-- o-- to the left-hand side obviously.
you're towards the outside of the page.
to the left-hand side.
right uh-huh.
yeah.
and so if you've gone round it don-- don't go beneath it though.
right.
okay.
uh-huh.
once you get to the bottom of it on the left-hand side of the rocket warehouse.
uh-huh uh-huh.
okay.
eh if you just draw a line more or less straight down to the left-hand side of the lighthouse because that's where the cross is for the finish.
you've got a lighthouse haven't you.
but what what about the ca-- there's a cave.
where's the cave.
right.
see the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse.
yeah.
right between that to the left it's sort of like in a triangle.
okay right okay.
do you have to go round the cave or.
i i don't have a cave.
t-- take the line from the rocket warehouse.
right.
uh-huh.
don't go straight down take it right to the left-hand side of the page.
to the left-hand side right.
so it will be round the cave.
almost right next to it.
right.
and only curve in where the bay starts starts again then trying you know.
right.
the word bay starts again.
do you not right sort.
see the see the see the old lighthouse is.
mmhmm.
okay.
just just draw a line straight through there.
yeah.
in a sort of curve.
draw draw.
the line yeah.
draw the line down to where where the land ends kind of thing.
right uh-huh.
and then.
oh right.
so then then cu-- you know draw a line to the right-hand side sorry to the right.
right.
to where the the the cross is.
'til.
you have a lighthouse don't you.
uh-huh.
the cross is just next to the lighthouse.
right.
which side.
the left-hand side sorry.
right.
okay.
mmhmm.
that's it.
are we going to do it the same way as we did it the last time from the standpoint of the viewer.
right okay.
right the wee man walking along the track right.
aye right.
so you're standing at the s-- the start's above the stony desert which is to your left.
er well it's no.
it's behind me but the right.
right.
if you're walking along the path then walk forward about a centimetre and a half.
uh-huh.
and then veer in a curve to your left.
should i be seeing anything.
no there's a site of a plane crash quite a bit a-- on the other side of the paper in front of you.
is that there no.
no it's miles away.
it's away up the top.
well there's two yeah there's two.
oh.
but there's one down here that isn't on your page okay.
is there a waterhole.
no.
there's a savannah.
right.
where's the savannah.
it just doesn't matter wait a minute.
right.
go forward a wee bit from the start.
aye.
to the left.
right.
and then go down to the left in a corner 'til you're about a centimetre above the bottom of the page.
oh so i uh i move forward from the start.
uh-huh.
then turn doon towards the bottom of the page.
uh-huh.
right.
and go right along.
uh-huh.
and then 'til you're about a centimetre and a half away from the edge.
right.
then go up.
so i turn to my right.
uh-huh turn to your right.
uh-huh.
about five centi--.
have you got a collapsed shelter.
aye.
right.
well 'til you're until that's on the same plane as you.
okay.
and then go round above it.
uh-huh.
then down.
what you mean down towards the bottom of the paper.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
do i do i go by the collapsed shelter.
uh-huh.
right uh-huh.
and then so that until you've got.
the collapsed shelter's on my right.
uh-huh.
right.
and then go round to your left.
my left.
as you're the wee guy.
so that's going up the-- up the paper again.
oh no have you not turned down yet.
right i've turned-- i've turned down right by the collapsed shelter towards the bottom of the paper.
uh-huh.
and then go in a straight line.
uh-huh.
left.

right.
and then turn right how far about f-- 'til you're directly above the start.
uh-huh.
right.

now follow the line of the river right down to the fork.
to the dead tree.
just above the dead tree before the fork.
okay i'm there.
right.
"now i want you to go to your left and do a sort of ""c"" quite a a wide ""c"" round some supposed."
i've got farmed land.
have you got farmed land.
no.
no well do a.
have i got to cross this babbling brook cross it.
not again.
"you've cross it further down you've got to do a wide ""c"" just above the fork do a wide ""c"" so that you're coming across the river at b-- you know underneath the dead tree."
i'm coming.
oh right i see okay.
right.
under the dead tree go directly south for about five maybe seven centimetres.
to the treasure.
i don't have that.
oh.
right.
then go to your right for about the same maybe five centimetres till you come to the lagoon.
do you have the lagoon.
yeah.
but it's to my left.
"unless that ""c"" wasn't big enough."
uh-huh.
you should have crossed one of the.
does your the river fork into one goes into the lagoon and the other one goes off the page.
goes to a mountain stream.
right okay.
mmhmm.
"is your ""c"" on the side of the stream or on the side of the lagoon."
it's in the middle like it comes out in between the two of them.
oh heck.
your river's different from mine.
"you want to you want my path to be a large enough ""c"" so as it goes down."
it and it crosses over the the mountain stream and then goes directly south underneath the dead tree.
is the dead tree in between the fork.
mmhmm.
right maybe so.
right.
right.
so you're going south then see i come to the lagoon then when i go south and then i go left which would me-- mean you going right.
you don't have be-- treasure buried underneath your dead tree.
no.
no.
do you have hills to your the left of the dead tree and just up a bit.
yes.
okay.
"so how f-- close do you want that ""c"" to take me towards the hills."
not close at all.
not close at all.
it's over the other side of the river.
is yours on this side of the river.
there are the the hills are on the left-hand side my left-hand side which is your left-hand side.
uh-huh.
oh because we're looking at the same picture.
right.
it's like you're starting at the s-- the sandy shore.
yeah.
going south then going along to the right and up and crossing the river.
mmhmm.
uh-huh across the bridge yeah.
at your bridge right you're going down to the fork of the.
river.
yes.
are you on the other side of the river from the the hills.
yes.
right.
same side as the woodlands.
right that's right.
"so at the top of just before the fork in the river do a ""c"" to the the same side don't don't cross the river at that point."
yes.
"do the do a ""c"" so that it."
don't cross the river.
"it it's like a backwards ""c""."
right i've not crossed.
do you see what i mean.
backwards.
w-- round that way instead of round that way.
"like an ""e""."
no.
oh yeah like a backwards s--.
"well a back a back like do a backwards ""c"" there sorry."
"yeah i've got a backwards ""c""."
yeah.
and cross the river under the dead tree for the first or the second time if you don't count if you count the one at the top.
under the dead tree so.
just just south of the dead tree.
okay.
right.
now go dead south for about five centimetres straight down from the dead tree.
yeah.
and then five centimetres to the left bringing you to the lagoon.
yeah.
right.
follow the shore of the lagoon down to the tip of it at the bottom.
right.
right.
do you have a rock fall.
no.
do you have green bay.
yes.
right.
do you see the point of green bay the top point of green bay.
the most northerly point.
yes.
go move to there but make it a.
right.
on on the coast is that a jutted point.
yes.
right.
take the line from the base of the lagoon from the point of the lagoon right down to the n-- most northerly point of green bay.
right.
do you have a pirate ship and the finish cross.
pirate ship's right down the the the southern.
right.
"now do a sort of ""l"" shape bringing you down to the pirate ship from where you are."
without going in the water.
going in the water.
going in the water.
going in the water.
right.
that's the finish.
have we just started.
yeah.
right.
ehm right.
you've got the start haven't you.
mmhmm.
above the caravan park.
above the caravan park yeah.
right.
eh have you got something between the caravan park and the old mill have you got something in the bottom left-hand corner.
the bottom left-hand corner i've got i've got a picket fence.
right.
see when you get start can you go round the picket fence.
right.
right round it and up over the old mill.
wait minute the car-- the picket fence is at the bottom left-hand corner.
mmhmm.
but can you go.
and the start is above the caravan park right.
uh-huh.
i just can you go down from the caravan park go down draw a line underneath the picket fence.
so i'm going round the left of the caravan park.
uh-huh sorry uh-huh.
an-- to the very bottom of the page and round the p--.
to the botto-- un-- uh-huh.
and round the picket fence.
to the very bottom.
round.
then when you get get to the end of the picket fence go up straight up round pa--.
right.
see the old mill.
mmhmm.
go right up there.
see the top par-- er left-hand corner the old mill.
go ri-- you go you're going round the old mill on the left-hand side.
li-- going round the left-hand side of the old mill.
uh-huh of the mill.
right.
so.
i'm going between the picket fence and the mill.
right.
if the you start right you go down straight down under the picket fence.
under the picket fence right.
go right round the picket fence.
right.
right.
got to do a curve come straight up.
right.
i'll have you know like i'll have to so i'm going between the picket fence and the mill right.
no.
are you not going right under the picket fence.
yes.
but you see the mill kind of overlaps my picket fence.
well.
you'll have to go right round it on the left-hand side.
uh-huh.
right.
so i'm going rou-- round the left-hand side of the mill.
of the old mill uh-huh.
and get to the top of the roof.
right.
you're you're at the roof right so go up and there's about mm.
right.
see the fenced meadow.
on the on the right-hand side at the bottom.
uh-huh.
mmhmm.
right.
see above that bi-- an inch and a half right about two inches right.
mark that mark a spot right above th-- about two inches above the fenced meadow on the very left of that picture go up about two inches right and mark a spot.
on the left of the fenced meadow.
uh-huh on left of that picture right of the fenced meadow.
come about two inches.
right.
oh the from the bottom of the picture.
uh-huh uh-huh.
come up about two inches.
where the fence is right on the left-hand s--.
right i'm.
so i'm below a forest.
so.
uh-huh.
and see where the o-- bi-- that but see where the old mill is.
mmhmm.
see you come up draw a line between that and that where that fenced meadow where you've just made a mark right draw a straight line.
right.
so i should be just a ve-- just below the forest as well.
yeah.
well.
i don't have a forest so ehm.
oh right i see.
i presume it must be.
so you must go round that.
right.
see where you are then.
uh-huh.
draw a straight line going up.
right.
and curve round the abandoned cottage right above it.
i ha--.
i have to curve round the forest.
right so.
and curve right up round above the.
so i'm going round the right-hand side of the forest which you haven't got.
to to your.
mmhmm you will be yeah.
right.
go round the right side.
and then right round t-- to to your left curve round to your left and you're going up above the abandoned cottage.
right.
so i'm going to the left-hand side of the abandoned cottage.
no.
go right.
right.
see where the forest is right.
uh-huh.
you're go-- you're curving right up and keep curving right round the side of the right-hand side sorry of the abandoned cottage so you're going round in a circle.
right.
i'm curving round it.
uh-huh.
right.
th-- the right-hand side go down right.
see where they've they've got the chimney right.
chimney no.
right see where that's s-- no.
i don't have a chimney.
see where the chimney is on the abandoned cottage.
oh yes.
right.
right.
right have you sto-- okay.
stop about there.
okay.
mmhmm.
have you got a fenced meadow on your le-- and about halfway up as well.
no.
you don't have a fenced meadow er.
where's that.
it's int-- half it's about halfway up the page and it's on the right the left-hand side of the page.
right.
halfway up.
i'm kind of in line with the a-- abandoned cottage.
well.
about a wee bit eh an angle down towards your left a wee bit i-- it's eh.
right.
right.
go up.
see where the chimney is right.
sort of make about a forty-five degree angle towards for about about an inch.
okay.
an inch.
did it go down d--.
make an ang-- an angle to the bottom of that picture right going to your left.
right.
so you're about an inch away from the abandoned cottage if you what i mean you're curving right round.
i've curved round the abandoned cottage.
right so.
sort of right right where you've stopped right.
uh-huh.
at that curve it should be about an inch away from the abandoned cottage right.
i'm not that far away.
i never knew.
right.
well can you make it make that curve.
but e-- i oh sorry i've still avoi-- i've still avoided the abandoned cott--.
and then where you've stopped the curve sort of make a wide circle.
eh have you got something between the a-- beside the abandoned cottage.
no.
well.
i've got i've just got a monument to the right.
to the right.
mm ah so have i.
i know where you are.
so.
do you know west lake is at the top.
uh-huh.
have you got a trig point.
no you don't do you.
no.
have you got anything between west lake and abandoned cottage.
no.
nothing at all.
no.
have you.
uh-huh.
what.
i've got a me-- a fenced meadow but in the dire--.
right.
so i have to avoid that.
mmhmm.
so.
am i going round the west lake.
so.
say the fenc-- say the fenced meadow's about halfway up.
right.
see where the abandoned cottage is.
uh-huh.
just down a wee bit right from that on the left.
so you make sure you avoid that right round the very left-hand side the page sort of mark a bit so you avoid that.
it's it's down a bit from the abandoned cottage.
abandoned cottage about a.
on the left.
a centimetre uh-huh.
right.
i-- it's f-- the very left of the page.
uh-huh the very left uh-huh.
right.
right.
see right where are you now at the bottom of the abandoned cottage.
mmhmm.
about an inch away.
no.
the top of the abandoned cottage.
did you make a curve.
no.
i've just come i've curved round the top of the abandoned cottage.
right.
that's all i've done.
i-- mark about an inch away from the abandoned cottage right and to your left mark about an inch away from that.
right.
a wee dot there.
eh no.
no can you mark a dot there.
where.
about an inch away from the abandoned cottage on the left-hand side make it make it about an inch right.
i'm not right.
and see where the roo-- you've the top of the roof is.
your your curve make a make a cu-- a line from there to there.
uh-huh.
right.
okay.
right i've done that.
right.
see where the west lake is.
uh-huh.
brrrr see where ehm the very bottom curve of it is.
uh-huh.
can you make it like.
see where you are now you're about an inch away from the abandoned cottage right.
can you make a sort of a wide circle sort of a half circle towards the ehm bottom of that point that curve of west lake.
mmhmm.
"right see where the ""e"" is in west lake."
mmhmm.
in lake.
eh go r-- it's right underneath there.
you know i'm talking about that point.
where it starts to curve like it's to there eh you need a kind of wide ci-- a h-- half circle.
yes.
a w--.
eh but you're about an inch and a half away from the edge of the page.
what am i avoiding.
see this eh what is it the thing you told me to mark.
it's a fenced meadow.
you're going above that.
i'm going above that right.
you're going above that.
and you're about two inches away from the page.
so i'm doing a cir--.
about a minute.
so see on-- see.
once i've done a circle up to where the.
the west lake is.
uh-huh.
mmhmm follow the curve of the west lake.
where do i go after that.
because i just i don't understand.
what way.
right to oh aye to the ehm right.
okay.
so i'm what am i avoi-- you know how i'm curving round what am i avoiding.
nothing.
there's nothing there either.
so why am i curving.
well.
that's what it is that's where the route is.
right.
okay.
right i've done that.
ehm.
so you've curv-- and like you follow the curve of west lake.
right.
see where that see where i told you to go to stop at.
you know.
so i'm like i'm really kind of doubling back on myself a bit.
uh-huh.
"you've got you're following to the to the right-hand side you're going right round the right-hand side see right see when you come to the right see right imagine you're at th-- the that point okay underneath the ""e""."
right.
i've done.
right.
yes.
at west lake right we're at that corner go round right round the circle.
to the right.
then.
uh-huh to the right.
then up keep going up.
how far.
am i just sort of circling round the west lake.
'til you stop.
uh-huh.
'til you stop.
where it starts you know where it starts eh sort of going sharply to the left in a straight line.
uh-huh.
stop there.
have you got farm land above there as well.
at that point.
uh-huh mmhmm so y--.
about an inch below the farm land right.
uh-huh.
right i've done that.
right.
see beside ehm see where you've stopped then right do you know where that sharp bit is i'm talking about.
just it curves round and then it goes up vertically and then you've i--.
follow that bit up vertically right 'til it stops going vertically that's what i mean right.
uh-huh i've done that right.
right.
see where you've stopped.
and how you can see a kind of a straight line it's almost a straight line.
mmhmm.
ehm.
to your left in the west lake you know it goes folli-- it's sort of goes up vertically and it goes straight to your left well it goes up a bit.
it goes up vertically then it goes to the left.
uh-huh.
mmhmm.
well.
just where it stops going vertically right.
right.
can you see the monument.
i don't have a monument.
oh no i have a mo--.
you do have a monument it's on the it's on the right-hand side it's to the right-hand side of the page about halfway up.
uh-huh.
away down.
uh-huh.
right.
see where you've stopped.
draw a straight line in that in that in that angle.
see where that that vertical see that ehm.
uh-huh.
that line on the west lake goes sh-- sharply up.
mmhmm.
dra-- draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there.
right down to the monument eh.
mmhmm.
on that angle.
and eh.
have you got a golf course.
no.
i take it you're going round the golf course.
just draw a straight line.
no.
the golf course is like nearer the east lake below the east lake so.
ah so it is.
so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf course.
right.
so where see the monument is.
you're going underneath the monument and up.
okay.
you're curving round the monument.
i'm com-- i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving r--.
and go round underneath it.
round the bottom of it.
and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh.
i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you below.
no.
between the west lake and the monument.
the west lake and the monument.
i've got a p-- trig point.
where's that so i have i have to avoid it.
that's that's it's abou-- it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up.
but where is it anyway.
where the vertical bit is.
where is it.
see where the west lake is with the writing west lake.
uh-huh.
it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake.
okay.
right.
so if i draw down.
you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake.
i will have right uh-huh.
you will right.
and then you go straight it's a total straight line.
a straight line.
going sloping downwards towards the monument.
right.
i've and then curve round the monument.
round the monument.
right.
just right round that.
i've done that.
eh sort of right.
are you at the of top the monument see the guy's head.
yes that's where i am.
right.
stop about there okay curved above it.
ehm you know the east lake is.
uh-huh.
just go vertically up there.
right.
how far.
fact.
i'll tell you what would be even better.
see the the guy's head on the monument the guy's hand sorry.
uh-huh.
where it's pointing right.
mmhmm.
so.
go straight draw the line to you know where your fa--.
see that curve that you're drawing round the monument.
stop above his hand.
mmhmm.
right.
ah i went a bit further 'cause i thought you said.
uh-huh.
right.
"and just c-- and go from there go straight up towards the east lake so you should be directly under the the ""e"" in lake."
no.
my monument's more to the right of the page than that the east lake's fa--.
uh-huh.
"see the ""e"" in the word lake."
"oh the word the ""e"" in the word la--."
"the word ""e""."
right.
in the lake right.
see directly u-- underneath that on the on the coast line of that if you know what i mean the edge of it.
mmhmm.
make a dot there right.
direc--.
directly.
"underneath the ""e""."
"underneath the ""e""."
"underneath the ""e""."
make a dot right beside the lake.
and from the monument the guy's hand on the monument draw a line from that.
okay.
to the east lake and then just follow the curve of the east lake.
right.
so you follow the curve of the east lake to the left.
sorry i've thought it was to the left.
right.
right.
right.
so eh.
you know the bottom left of the east lake.
uh-huh.
about in a centimetre away from that keep drawing a line and then finish it.
okay.
the botto-- wha--.
say that again.
"see the ""e"" in the east."
yes.
the letter the word east.
underneath that draw a line about an inch away from that okay keep following the coast line.
but don't don't go up don't go up vertically.
right.
don't go up.
you kn-- h-- just go straight along that except carry the line on.
uh-huh.
how far.
for about another centimetre.
and just draw a cross.
"a centimetre from the ""e""."
mmhmm.
is that all.
right.
mmhmm.
y-- but see where the east lake is see that that kind of line you followed.
uh-huh.
s-- of the lake.
uh-huh.
d-- you haven't gone up have you.
'cause the line goes straight up you know how it goes vertically up.
what with the.
no i haven't done that.
well.
that's okay.
that'll be it finished.
eh right.
the route's starting at the chestnut tree.
okay.
and i want you to go towards the left-hand side of the page.
mmhmm.
and just before you get there if if that was going forwards then turn to your right and go up about an inch and a half and then turn to your right again.
mmhmm.
then branch off above the attractive cliffs not quite in a straight not in a quite in a ninety degree angle ehm.
say it start again wait from.
uh-huh.
from the chestnut tree right as if you were going forward to the edge of the page.
mmhmm.
but not quite.
right.
then turn to your right.
mmhmm.
and go up about an inch and a half or two inches turn right again not quite at ninety degrees and then turn if that was forwards turn to your left up to above the attractive hills to n-- near the vast meadow.
mmhmm.
right.
ehm you go forward from there and you branch off.
you can see that ehm jutty-out bit in crane bay you've g-- you've got.
in where.
oh right aye.
you've got to go up ehm to your left again but keep quite close when you get to that top corner.
keep qu-- uh-huh.
wait a minute.
if i oh when i'm by crane bay.
uh-huh.
which direction have i been coming from.
right.
you've c-- you've come from vast meadow.
right.
mmhmm.
and there's an outcrop of land well you're not going quite on to that.
right.
right you're going up to the next corner above vast meadow.
"just sort of diagonally opposite the ""c"" of crane bay."
right.
you've got to turn to your left up the way.
do you want me to run by that one again.
yeah if you could.
right where've we got to vast meadow.
uh-huh.
right.
turn to your left at vast meadow.
right.
and then when it comes to crane bay you're keeping quite close to the coast.
no.
no.
you're not anywhere near that.
nowhere near the coast.
well you should be.
right so.
ehm.
i'll just go down here then.
retrack to vast meadow and attractive cliffs you should be in between where it says vast meadow and the the picture of the attractive cliffs.
oh right.
mucked this up completely have i.
we've probably got different maps right.
ehm right and you're turning left up there.
turning left.
uh-huh towards the coast.
right.
it's not really towards the coast it's sort of what would it be northeastwards no it wouldn't be northeastwards if you were coming that way it would be northwestwards.
right.
"ehm along above where it says crane bay you keep quite close to the coast and above the ""e"" of crane bay you're making a ninety degree turn to your left again."
right.
towards the reclaimed fields.
right.
and you've got to skirt round them ehm taking a right turn.
mmhmm.
go right round ehm until you get to just above them.
mmhmm.
towards the chapel.
and then you've got to go.
towards what.
the chapel.
you do have a chapel.
no.
oh.
i could draw one in.
do you have seven beeches.
i do.
right.
head up towards seven beeches then.
mmhmm.
and from seven beeches.
right.
i'll start in the right place this time suppose that's one point in my favour that i said start at the chestnut tree.
mm.
that's just a habit of mine to start at the bottom of a map and work my way up.
sorry.
right.
okay.
okay.
bit young for a missus.
yes.
"right this is lindsey and melanie number ""n"" ""a"" ""q"" three ""c"" two plus minus four ""d"" ""u""."
right if you'd like to start at the beginning.
at at the start.
at the start which is above the haystack.
okay.
right.
right.
ehm if you you're heading southwards.
mmhmm.
ehm more or less straight slight bend towards the hi-- the haystack.
ehm come down to about level with the carpenter's house and then you want to head along towards the carpenter's house.
mmhmm.
ehm head up ehm what what sort of angle sort of northeastwards towards green bay and stick fairly well.
wait a minute towards where.
green bay at the top.
green bay.
uh-huh.
ehm no green bay.
no green bay.
ehm there should be an inshot at the top th-- that would look like water.
nope.
no.
anyway head up for about two and a half inches from the carpenter's house.
right.
right ehm.
upwards.
yes.
okay.
and in a more or less straight line sloping slightly down the way head along for about another two inches then slope down towards seven beeches.
mmhmm.
ehm curve round slightly to your right.
to my right.
yes.
as i look at it.
yes.
because you're going round the chapel you should be heading down towards the reclaimed fields where we got to the last time.
right.
ehm you want to go you want to circle the reclaimed fields right round to your right you want to go round the right of them as you look at it.
right.
and come along for oh about two inches again and then head down straight down southwards towards the bay.
mmhmm.
and stick fairly close to the coast for about an inch and a half.
okay.
then slope down towards vast meadow in between vast meadow and attractive cliffs ehm an angle sort of.
wait a minute.
uh-uh.
have i lost you.
right.
take me from reclaimed fields again.
right have you circled them not quite circled them come round to the right of them.
come round to the right of them.
uh-huh.
right round underneath wh-- to where it says reclaimed fields.
okay.
right for about an inch and a half.
right.
right.
okay.
and straight down towards the bay.
right.
and you keep fairly close to the coast for about an inch and a half of that then head.
i sound as if i'm making an awful lot of mistakes here.
no it's my old one i'm s-- scribbling out.
ehm head down at a southwesterly angle towards vast meadow and the attractive cliffs.
yes.
right.
you should be in between them you head down in a straight line between vast meadow and attractive cliffs.
a straight line between them.
uh-huh.
"until about the ""a"" of vast meadow."
what.
okay.
right.
and again the same sort of southwesterly angle down to where it says attractive cliffs.
okay.
right.
and then a much more westerly angle for about an inch and then following the side of the map down and then curve round eastwards towards the finish.
what finish.
at the ch--.
at the chestnut tree.
right.
well i hope that's better than the last one was.
okay.
right.
there.
see if that one's any it's probably.
have you got the crest falls marked on your map.
yep.
okay.
the start's just above that.
yeah i've got that marked as well.
all right okay.
so you start off eh going toward your left horizontally wee bit then go down the side of crest falls.
okay.
then horizontally left until you're about an inch away from the left-hand side of the page.
right.
you've got the footbridge marked.
eh yeah but it's not there it's in the middle.
so i'll write footbridge.
yes yes okay.
right.
go up the side of the page eh straight up until you're level with the footbridge.
uh-huh.
okay.
then cut along to the footbridge.
underneath.
no.
just eh g-- i mean go along the.
footbridge.
alright.
okay.
just to the end of it.
right okay.
have you got poison stream marked by the footbridge.
n-- eh no the poisoned stream is up in the top left-hand corner.
right okay.
okay.
right well.
just eh once you get to footbridge go directly down for 'bout an inch and a half.
right.
and then along straight along horizontally to your right.
mmhmm.
and you've got the old temple marked.
yeah.
right okay.
go up ss-- the left-hand side of the old temple.
okay.
now go up eh over the top of.

right.
you've not got the baboons marked.
no.
right okay.
go down eh about an inch and a half directly down.
from the abandoned truck.
yeah.
right.
and then horizontally along until you're about half an inch from the left-hand side of the page.
okay.
then go straight up and cut in a bit just to the left of the white mountain.
right.
and then keep going up eh 'til you're about three inches from the top of the page.
you've got the pyramid marked.
yeah.
right okay.
now go along 'til you get to the pyramid.
i've eh i've got a lemon grove.
lemon grove okay.
i would just avoid that.
right okay.
and across to.
the pyramid.
above it or below it.
above it.
right.
right.
above over the other side.
uh-huh.
and then go eh down go along to your left just below the pyramid.
okay.
eh go until you're at the left-hand edge of the pyramid.
uh-huh.
and then go down at a bit of an angle bit of a southwest angle.
mmhmm.
eh for about five inches to where just below the remote village.
right.
and the finish is just southeast of the remote village eh so if you go beneath the remote village for about eh well it's about half an inch from the edge of the remote village.
so i'm on the left-hand side of the remote village right.
right okay.
uh-huh.
just below it.
right.
right.
just go along for about eh three inches two and a half inches.
what along to the right.
yeah.
okay.
i'm underneath it now.
and that's where the finish is.
okay.
okay.
finish is just beyond the remote village.
okay.
right.
right.
well the start is.
i know the start it's marked down here.
ah is it the same.
mmhmm right.
the diamond mine.
mmhmm.
right.
so you're going vertically downwards about.
well.
where are we going to first.
eh.
where are we going.
where are we finishing.
no.
where where have we to go by.
i mean is have you got have you got a walled city.
uh-huh.
a walk city.
a walled city.
yes.
but it's further down the page.
ehm have you got a desert have you got a desert on the right-hand side.
uh-huh.
there's a desert.
the left-hand side i mean.
on the left-hand side uh-huh.
uh-huh.
underneath the diamond mine.
underneath.
to the left.
uh-huh.
so do you go by a desert.
no.
like.
which side do you go round.
you're going vertically downwards past the diamond mine.
straight down.
you know just c-- you're curving just curving round the diamond.
uh-huh.
mine uh-huh.
uh-huh.
curve round.
to your right.
uh-huh.
right right underneath the diamond mine.
where do i stop.
well do.
have you got a graveyard sort of in the middle of the page on a level to the c-- er diamond mine.
no.
i've got a fast running creek.
a fast flowing river eh.
no.
where's that.
mmhmm eh.
canoes.
where is that.
eh the fast running creek is at the top right-hand side of the page beside diamond mine.
no.
the diamond mine is that on the right-hand side of your page.
it's the left-hand side.
ah.
the fast flowing river is at the top.
right.
right that's i've got that.
underneath that's canoes.
no.
have you got an apache camp.
ehm i've got uh-huh.
carved wooden pole.
yeah.
no i don't have that.
er that's the s-- that's the apache camp.
ss.
right so w-- anyway so at the diamond mine right.
mmhmm.
and i have to curve underneath.
start go down come underneath the diamond mine.
curve underneath.
have you got s-- see between the fast flowing river and the diamond mine have you got anything.
nope.
right so.
got canoes.
i've got a graveyard there.
right i see.
whereabouts is that.
eh really just right in the middle of the two the fast flowing mine fast flowing river and the diamond mine.
s-- right.
so where've i to go have i to go round that graveyard or something.
uh-huh.
you've to miss the graveyard so if you.
right you've curved round right.
i've g-- right i mean that i i'm still at diamond mine so i'm not sure where to go.
mmhmm.
so.
if you go o--.
well just start slightly going up the way.
mmhmm.
to the fast running creek.
and right.
imagine there's a graveyard.
right.
mmhmm.
right.
just in the centre of the diamond mine.
uh-huh.
and the fast flowing river just imagine that.
right.
uh-huh.
and you j-- you're going round that you're going round the graveyard.
like as above it.
no.
below it.
right.
so just slightly below it then.
mmhmm.
to where.
so you're sort of curving round to the graveyard.
uh-huh.
right okay.
right.
right.
right.
so we're going slightly up.
you're going round the graveyard.
uh-huh.
but i can't imagine where the graveyard is right.
i know you don't.
right.
it's just.
just imagine it's the same size as the diamond mine and the fast flowing river i-- right but it's parked in the middle.
right right okay.
so where are we now.
so.
so i've to go round.
if mmhmm.
but where am i going after that.
i've got to know where i'm going this is it.
you've to you're going round the top of the fast flowing river after you've avoided the graveyard.
right.
and i curve right round the fast flowing river then.
uh-huh mmhmm.
where to.
well right.
you go round.
then.
have you got canoes.
no.
have you got apache camp.
oh uh-huh i've got an apache camp.
it's maybe.
see where you see where fast running creek is and the apache camp.
mmhmm.
bang splat in the middle of that right i've got canoes.
right.
i don't.
right so.
have you got oh you've got you know i've got to go round that so.
uh-huh.
so where are we.
so if you right.
in line with the fast flowing river if you come down maybe one and a half inches.
mmhmm.
eh have you got a carved wooden pole.
yeah.
but it's away down at the bottom of the page.
oh right.
and where's your apache camp.
just before we're halfway down the page.
do-- have you got flat rocks.
mmhmm.
right.
it's just above that it's about a couple of inches but up above that.
yeah that's right.
so if you like c-- curve round the.
apache camp.
no.
don't curve round it j--.
just you're going m-- forty-five degree angle eh towards the bottom eh left of the page you're going that way you know.
towards the walled city.
uh-huh.
right.
so i'm going round.
and you're going round the outside of the walled city.
on what s-- on what side.
you're going round the top of the walled city and round the left of it on the left-hand side.
so.
and that's at an angle of forty-five degrees.
no.
right i see right.
so from the walled city to where i am just there it's at a forty-five degree angle to where i just wa-- came from.
no.
right see where the fast running creek is right.
yes.
i've just come down a couple of inches.
you've come down about one and a half inches.
uh-huh.
right so.
if you do it then do a forty-five degree line for maybe about three inches 'til you're probably in line with the top of the walled city.
erm.
that height what you're you've to come down the middle of the page take the forty-five degree line down to the middle of the page.
right.
so i should be around the middle of the page.
no not the mi-- the centre no not.
see where i am just now right.
i've come i've come round the top of the fast running creek.
uh-huh.
so i'm really i'd be about i'd be about an inch from the end of the page.
that's right.
and i'm going straight down from that so still i'm an inch away from the page the end of the page.
uh-huh.
so now you've got to take it take your line to the left 'til you come into.
towards the walled city.
uh-huh.
right so i'm above the walled city now and i've curved right round it.
yes.
mmhmm.
i'm just into the left so i'm down at the left-hand side of the page i'm just at the bottom of the walled city.
the walled city is just above the cen-- halfway up the page right.
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh.
and you've you've just curved round that.
towards the left.
uh-huh.
and how far is it away from the left-hand side of the page.
about two inches.
that's fine.
so if you've i-- yeah you've curved round.
mmhmm.
right.
are you in line with the bottom of the walled city.
bottom of it have i got to be in line with that.
have i to cut.
no.
right.
just take it down there so i can tell you how many more inches to go down.
so i'm at bottom where the writing is of the walled city so i'm just just t-- in a straight line down there curve right round it 'til i'm there.
uh-huh just there yeah.
so uh-huh.
and er am i going back to the right now.
no.
you're going straight down.
i'm going straight down right.
in a slight curve you're taking it down maybe about to as far as a a third of the way up the page.
mmhmm.
i'm taking it down there.
you're com--.
uh-huh.
in a curve.
just a very slight curve you know really just about vertically you're going down.
mmhmm.
so right.
mmhmm.
so.
now.
i'm at ghost town.
no.
oh i've got another carved wooden pole down the page as well.
that's uh-huh that's where uh-huh.
i can see that.
uh-huh.
and the flat rocks i've.
ard--.
in the middle of the page.
no.
they're more like to the right-hand side.
ah halfway up i mean.
mmhmm.
so see where i tell you've got a carved wooden pole and a walled city right.
to the right.
see the carved wooden pole at the bottom of the page near where the three.
can you see a fort.
yes.
right.
at the v--.
see above it that's the carved wooden pole.
uh-huh.
and the right.
you should be about an inch and a half above that though shouldn't be down that far yet.
that's what i mean uh-huh.
but but see where the carved wooden pole is and you've got see between the walled city and the carved wooden pole.
uh-huh.
i've got a ghost town.
oh have you.
mmhmm.
i don't have anything.
right well.
so where am i going from walled city.
i'm at the ghost town that's it ri-- right between the carved pole and the walled city i'm right in the middle of that.
right.
well you should curve just you you'll have to go below the.
ghost town.
uh-huh.
right i s-- aye.
right just curve round it.
mmhmm.
and have you got a stone creek.
mmhmm.
where's that.
is that about a third of the way u-- up the page.
uh-huh mmhmm.
to like right-hand side.
right.
well you're going above that.
mmhmm.
and you're going up to where the flat rocks are you're just curving up.
mmhmm.
you're avoiding the stone creek in but you're below the flat rocks just very close to the flat rocks.
below the flat rocks.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
and i go underneath the flat rocks.
so it's just like a c--.
uh-huh.
it's like a curve.
right.
and then.
so if you take your line to the end of the flat rocks.
uh-huh.
there's saloon bar.
then you're going.
no.
right okay.
you got buffalo.
mmhmm.
that's down at the bottom right.
bottom pa--.
uh-huh bottom right uh-huh.
well.
what you're doing is you're you should be about an in-- an inch off the end of the page.
uh-huh i am just now.
the right.
uh-huh.
so you're just it's a vertical line basically down eh.
to the buffalo.
round the b-- the buffalos.
uh-huh.
round the buffalos.
uh-huh.
what do you mean like right round.
below the buffalo.
uh-huh.
right.
uh-huh.
so have you got a cattle ranch.
to where.
no.
have you got anyth--.
i take it it's between the fort and the buffalo.
have you got anything there.
no.
well.
if you right you've curved round below the buffalo.
the buffalo.
mmhmm.
if you just maybe imagine there's a cattle ranch there.
right.
just after the buffalo.
right between the buffalo and the fort.
between the fort uh-huh.
mmhmm.
and it's more in line with the fort.
right.
uh-huh.
so you know how you've curved round.
mmhmm.
where the buffalos are.
you've you'll have to you know.
curve round again sort of thing.
do a bump.
right i know where you are have to bump.
in your route.
and you go round again to the fort.
uh mmhmm.
that's the end.
bump in your route and then round to the fort.
and the finish is above the fort maybe about an inch above the fort.
so on what side on the left or right.
on the left-hand side.
on the left-hand side of the fort.
mmhmm.
so i've got to go right round the f--.
on the left-hand side you've.
i've got to go right round the fort.
uh-huh.
right.
you know you've got to go below the fort.
uh-huh.
right round to about the is it near the carved wooden pole then the finish.
yes.
it's in line with the carved wooden pole except it's an inch from the.
the fort.
no.
an inch from the left-hand side of the page.
right uh-huh i'm there.
is that you.
i-- but is the finishing point at the fort.
no.
it's above.
right above the fort och i've just got a general gist there.
'bout an inch above the fort.
right okay.
that's it.
right.
right.
right mm.
have you got a missionary camp down the bottom.
yes.
then that's where your start is.
mmhmm.
right.
that's right.
okay well.
you need to go ehm travel left about an inch and then go down along the side of the missionary camp so you're going downwards just running along parallel to it.
right okay.
okay.
down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map.
right.
okay.
now.
you have you got a some gorillas over on the left.
no.
i've got a banana tree though.
alright that's probably.
do you think that's probably the same.
yeah that's probably about it.
mm yeah.
so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree.
right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that.
right okay.
right nothing else kind of down there.
right.
and i want to stop directly below.
yeah.
well.
actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map.
mmhmm.
right that's okay.
okay.
so you then go upwards about.
and then have you got a rope bridge.
yeah.
right.
you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge.
oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so.
ah right.
is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across.
yeah.
if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge.
right okay.
and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge.
right fine.
okay.
down about an inch so you come you've come off the rope bridge and you drop down about an inch.
right.
erm i don't know if i can do that without going in the river actually.
oh yeah.
i for-- yeah there's a river isn't there.
well.
if you just take it so that you're running alongside the river.
just right along the edge of the river.
yeah so you need to run alongside the river for about um three or four inches.
right okay.
and then.
you have got a waterfall on the right-hand side.
yeah.
well then um.
just 'til when you're about ehm level with the b-- with the bottom of the waterfall.
mmhmm.
then you go straight upwards alongside the waterfall.
right.
have you got some lost steps there.
erm yes i have.
but quite a bit above maybe something like five inches or something above.
oh no th--.
these these are in the middle.
have you got some fallen pillars.
yes.
okay.
well.
where are you at the moment.
um d-- just stop beside the waterfall that's right over on the right-hand side.
yeah.
right you need to go upwards until you're level with the fallen pillars.
right okay.
okay.
fine.
and then imagine that you had.
you see the lost steps at the top.
yes.
if you imagine that they were there just where you've stopped.
mmhmm.
so you need to loop over the top of them as if you were going over something.
so you you're going u--.
right.
so which way am i heading then left or right.
right.
you're going left towards the fallen pillars.
right okay.
okay.
if you go over the.
so i'll let out a well i'll allow for being above the fallen pillars yeah.
uh-huh yeah.
and then you need to head back down again to go underneath the fallen pillars.
right okay.
mmhmm.
i've got flamingoes down here with a.
okay.
yeah.
quite a small gappy bit.
right.
then if you go down and underneath what.
i w-- i haven't got anything but i think that's where your flamingoes are.
um well.
they're just maybe an inch below and an inch to the left of the fallen pillars.
right okay.
so if you then go right underneath the flamingoes.
right okay.
and and then up right up towards th--.
have you got ancient ruins.
er i've got a ruined city abo-- maybe half the distance to the top from there.
yeah okay.
right yeah that's right.
so you go right up to the ehm ruins.
uh-huh.
just keeping on the edge of the page yeah.
and then you.
keeping on the edge.
maybe a bit in towards a bit heading towards the ruins.
right okay.
and then have you got some stones at the left-hand s-- on the left-hand side right in the top left-hand corner.
erm i've no i haven't got anything up there.
okay.
i've got a rock fall kind of fairly near to the centre.
ah right.
er in between.
well you you know where the ruins are.
yeah.
you've got where are you now.
i'm just to the to the left-hand side of them.
right okay.
now you need to go straight up so that you're now about two inches from the top of the map and about.
right.
just just level with the side.
yes.
and about three inches from the side.
right okay.
okay.
right up to the top.
so that no.
about two inches from the top.
right okay.
okay.
and then.
that's it and then right have you got a white mountain.
yeah.
right.
you need to just run vertically along and then to get as if you were climbing the mountain and going back down the other side so you go along to the white mountain.
right okay.
up.
up on the left-hand side just go up up the side.
up th-- up the left yeah.
up the side of the mountain and then down the other side.
right okay.
then.
have you got a soft furnishings furnishings store.
no.
i've got nothing round about there 'part from the lost steps and directly below the mountain i've got gazelles.
okay.
or i have the gazelles anyway.
well.
you need to then.
right.
you're at the bottom of the mountain now.
erm.
erm am i going underneath it.
okay.
yeah.
you need to go underneath it but by about an inch underneath.
loo--.
right okay.
okay.
and then.
now now you should be level with the beginning of the mountain so you should be level with the left-hand side of the mountain.
oh right i see what you mean.
y-- you're going back on yourself.
yeah well i've got a rock fall there so i can't.
right.
i've got a rock fall just across from that so.
oh okay.
um well so you're now you should be underneath the mountain.
yeah.
okay.
now you need to drop straight down towards the gazelles.
right.
coming in at the top of them.
that's right.
and then go round the bottom of the gazelles.
on the left-hand side.
and head off to the right-hand side.
so you go under the gazelles yeah.
right.
i've got a big space here which presumably.
that's where we're finishing soon here finishing here.
you've got something in.
right okay.
so you're underneath the gazelles.
right.
yeah.
straight off to the right about three inches and then we stop.
right.
okay so you're going in the opposite direction to the ancient ruins.
right.
yeah.
okay that's it.
is that it.
right fine.
right.
at the very top of the page there's a cross.
yep.
do you have a diamond mine just below it.
mmhmm.
about an inch to your right draw a line straight down.
right.
c-- start from the cross yeah.
'til it's abo-- 'til it's an inch below the diamond mine.
right.
do you have a wagon--.
it's directly down yeah.
yeah.
do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond mine.
mm no i haven't got any wagon wheel.
what's the f-- next thing to its right.
to the right i've got eventually a cactus.
you don't have a rift valley.
oh i've got a rift valley above that.
yeah okay.
y-- you've got the rift valley right up at the top right-hand side.
you're drawing your line down.
mmhmm.
underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the page.
towards the right-hand corner.
yeah.
ehm that's going to take me f-- pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that.
right.
hang on hang on right.
an inch to the right of the diamond mine.
yeah.
yeah and then straight down to an inch below it.
should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay.
yeah.
and then go st-- straight along to my right which is your right as well go straight along to the right.
okay.
to right to the edge of the page.
no.
to about halfway to page about four inches off before the page.
er right okay.
that takes me to.
then go s-- up to almost the very top of the page.
okay.
right.
and then to your right again.
okay hang on.
well but.
have you got the rift valley there.
'cause i've got the rift valley right up in that r-- top right-hand corner.
yeah.
you're going to actually go through the rift valley.
like the rift valley's like a half moon.
yeah.
you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley.
right.
go through the centre.
i'll just take it up and go through the centre yeah.
yeah.
"like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean."
right okay.
erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up.
yeah below.
and then like into the rift valley.
okay right.
and right through.
i'll have to t-- i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour.
right.
and just take it straight through towards the top of the page.
straight through yeah.
alright there we go.
and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way.
do you know what i mean.
not quite.
right.
you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right.
was i.
yeah.
above the rift valley.
you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint.
right.
mm that's not where i am now.
right so where hang on right so.
"your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah."
yeah.
in a c-- like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the page.
yeah.
right.
and i was supposed to start above it there and come down through it.
yes.
well.
i've done it back to front but never mind right.
eh so i should now be below it.
yeah.
through the midpoint.
below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rocks.
yeah.
and do you have a stone creek.
erm no.
i've got the rocks i've got like two rocks.
uh-huh.
and again a couple of inches below that i've got outlaws' hideout.
yeah.
i've got that.
but i haven't got anything else round about that area.
you've got nothing to like the left of it.
er right over i've got rapids about three inches across from the rocks.
well i've got a stone creek there.
see in between.
you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks.
thr-- through the centre of the two rocks.
no.
no not sorry.
i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch.
right okay.
so is it.
well okay alright i think i've got this.
the first part of this is a total state.
do you have white water.
er well that'll be the rapids.
yeah that's true.
and you don't have a stone creek above your white water.
no i've got.
or a swamp to its left.
i've got the swamp.
and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond mine.
to its left.
well that's a a stone c-- ss.
but you know right right back at the start.
oh no aye yeah.
you don't have like above the the rapids to its s-- slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek.
nope.
no well.
take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like.
am i going above or below here.
at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks.
above.
so where's where do i go from there.
right okay.
right round the white water or right round the rapids.
taking it round from the top or.
from the top.
but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek.
right okay.
right.
so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapids.
right okay.
come down come straight down to below that like j-- a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like s-- straight down but like.
oh i see what you mean yeah.
in like length further down from that on the page.
have you got a manned fort below the rapids.
no.
'cause i've got that interrupting er like dir-- almost directly below it slightly to the left i've got a manned fort.
you got another stone creek.
eh oh right.
and stone slabs.
yeah it's right the way down below the manned fort.
have you not got anything in between the rapids and the stone creek down at the bottom.
no.
well yeah.
slightly to its right there's some stone slabs.
yeah no in right in between the two of those i've got a manned fort.
no.
how far down's the manned fort.
er about two inches maybe two and a half.
take it further down go right under the manned go under your manned fort and between your stone creek.
the stone creek and the stone slabs.
no.
go r-- go down under your manned fort and then.
which way do you want me to go round the r-- left or the right-hand side of that.
go round the left-hand side.
right okay.
and then.
when you get to the b-- when you get below it go up towards your ha-- outlaws' hideout and sort of take the line s-- sloping up so it's like going straight up towards the outlaws' hideout or it's going close to the hideout it's like you're so you're going to the other side of the page.
right so.
it's a diagonal across the page towards that.
yeah.
that sounds a bit drastic.
right.
right below your outlaws' hideout a good bit below do you have a noose.
yeah.
have you got a gold mine there as well just.
no.
just to below and to the right of the outlaws' hideout i've got a gold mine.
no i've got nothing.
i'm going to be quite wealthy i've got all the mines.
do you have a swan pond.
erm no.
no.
do you have a saloon bar.
er i've got a saloon bar right down on the left-hand side.
head for that and we'll be okay.
no ehm see the outlaws' hideout.
short cut.
yeah.
you're right up beside that.
mmhmm i'm.
ju-- well i've got it at the moment i'm slightly below it but.
you've got a gold mine a gold mine you got a gold mine below that.
yeah.
far below it.
erm.
directly below it.
not directly below it.
"just just below the ""u"" if you take it down from the hideout er that that's just that's just at the left-hand side."
aye.
that'll be where my s-- that'll be where my stone labs.
that'll be where my stone slabs are.
but are your stone slabs not kind of at the other side of that.
i would imagine.
'cause my stone slabs are like maybe what two and a half inches below and to the left.
aye right okay.
so you're saying they're it's to the right then this thing.
the gold mine is.
right above the noose.
mm aye directly above the noose that's a better description.
okay.
well--.
from where that line is that you've drawn go straight down 'til you pass the noose and you're passing the noose like on its right-hand side by a wee bit.
on its right-hand side.
if you know what i mean.
yeah.
so that's like towards the edge of the paper here.
mmhmm.
right there we go.
i've come right down below that.
yeah.
then you don't have anything else down like.
i've got the saloon bar and i've got the stone creek directly across to the left of the noose er but i've got nothing else in that area at all.
uh-huh.
right.
you know like below that i should say i mean in the m-- in the middle and to b-- above them and the stone slabs.
okay.
right.
you know how the like on line with the saloon bar.
mmhmm.
about two inches along i've got a swans pond.
right.
so i've to avoid that.
you want to avoid that.
so.
so go above it.
need to go go up above it.
and then down and under the saloon bar to the finish.
phoar.
is that you.
that's it yeah.
yee-ha.
okay.
home boy let's see you done.
what the first bit of that was a total disaster.
he'll probably kill me here.
'cause i came through the rift valley the wrong way i was supposed to come from the top and go down 'til like down through it.
yeah.
'cause i well i came from underneath don't know what i was doing down there.
right ehm eh.
the start is down at the bottom.
i-- d-- do you just have a plain bit of paper.
no.
i've got er w-- mountains.
oh the right.
see the have you got a stony desert down at the bottom right-hand corner.
yes.
well.
the start is just just above that.
it's just above that.
yeah i know.
th-- that's marked on my map as well.
right.
ehm right.
we'll be working our way ehm up to the top and then back kind of down to the middle where the finish is.
ehm from the start you go along past the stony desert and down.
ehm so you're going right.
no ehm.
the stony desert is below the start.
yeah.
right.
and we're going left from that and kind of round round left past the stony desert and down until you're kind of level with the bottom of the stony desert.
right.
so i-- i'm going left.
uh-huh.
and how far left.
left from the start and y-- just just kind of round the outside of the desert you know right round the outline and then keep going down until you're kind of level with the stony desert.
but just round the outline of the desert.
yeah.
right right.
right.
and you're down to the level of the bottom if you run your finger along the bottom of the stony desert.
right.
right.
and then keep going straight along.
right.
i'm going along the bottom of the paper.
uh-huh.
you're going you're still going along left.
how far to the end of the bit of paper.
ehm.
about an inch an i-- 'bout an inch from the the s-- the left-hand side of the paper.
just keep going along straight.
right.
and then we start going up.
ehm.
right.
about three inches maybe.
three inches.
erm and there's a the site of a plane crash.
i don't have that my plane crash is away up in the top right.
oh right.
erm does that mean that you have to draw this on.
do i.
ehm.
well.
the maps were drawn by two different people.
uh-huh.
don't know.
maybe you should just mark that on anyway.
there's a the site of a plane crash just just to the right of your line.
right-o.
kind of near to the bottom.
okay.
right.
an-- and you carry on your line you've gone up about three inches and you start going right again.
mmhmm.
kind of a straight line about.
well.
below the site of the plane crash.
er.
no no.
wait a mi-- wait a minute.
ehm.
above the site of the plane crash.
yeah uh-huh.
right.
your plane crash should be kind of down a wee bit towards the the line at the bottom.
nearer the bottom of the page.
yeah.
how far up from the bottom of the page.
about right.
ther-- there should be about an inch in between the bottom of your page and your first line right.
right that's fine.
right.
and then your plane crash is just kind of above that.
oh just above that.
uh-huh.
right after that.
mm.
'kay.
and then you go up three inches.
yeah uh-huh.
and you're going about another er two and a half inches maybe until you're kind of in the centre of the page i d-- i don't mean i don't mean right in the centre i mean.
mean half way up.
uh-huh.
lower centre.
yeah.
another t-- right.
and that.
just below the centre.
uh-huh.
and then above that i mean sorry below that there's a collapsed shelter just below that line.
i've got elephants there.
what'll i do.
elephants.
i don't have elephants on mine.
not at all.
no not at all.
er i'm i'm not sure we're supposed to be doing.
ehm.
and then you have to go down again.
wait i go past the collapsed shelter.
past the collapsed shelter.
it's kind of underneath your line.
and you go down again about half an inch kind of rou--.
how long do i go along.
ehm it's kind of like a straight.
a straight line.
a straight li--.
not a str-- quite a straight line down but it's kind of it's vertical anyway.
down for about half an inch.
yeah.
right.
and then.
so i just sort of is that like round the collapsed shelter a line going round.
yeah.
uh-huh.
right.
and then you you're going you're you're still going right along.
right.
after i've come down the half inch i'm going right.
you're going right again uh-huh.
how long for.
ehm.
about two inches.
and you're kind of you're kind of going right and going up.
oops.
the same time.
there's hot springs above me now.
oh.
right.
right.
and you should be kind of ehm two and a half inches away from the right-hand side of the page just now.
oh uh-huh no.
no.
where are you.
my inches must be different from yours 'cause i'm not even halfway across the page.
i should be away at the other s-- side of the page.
you should be kind of at the right-hand side.
how l-- how big's your page.
er.
is it that size.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
er two and a h-- two.
right.
j-- just go further along then 'til you're.
just go right along.
uh-huh.
so where how far up the the right-hand side should it be.
you shou-- you should be.
ehm.
when i reach the right-hand side how f-- about halfway.
how how do you mean.
er you told me to draw a line going alo-- over to the right-hand side.
uh-huh.
and you should be about two and a half inches fr-- from the right-hand side of the e-- edge of the page.
h--.
two and a half inches one.
yeah.
two and a half right.
is it sort of just sloping upwards this line.
uh-huh.
kind of gently sloping upwards.
and there's a savannah at the right-hand side of your line just now.
no.
there isn't.
well well.
there is on mine.
there's there's there's a a savannah further down.
uh-huh.
ehm.
well y--.
you go past.
is the line about halfway up the page just now.
no not quite.
where are.
we're still we're still a bit nearer the bottom.
but.
oh right.
that that line shouldn't have been that long really.
but this this line carries up to about the centre of the page but you're still kind of at the right-hand side kind of vertical line up.
when.
about ehm.
now.
oh right.
yeah and.
a vertical line up.
yeah.
maybe about another two and a half inches.
so i should be f-- more than halfway up the page further.
are you sh--.
you should be about exactly halfway up the page.
and but you're still kind of at the right-hand side.
i know.
i'm at the i'm about two and a half inches off the right-hand side.
right that's fine.
but i'm mm but i'm too high i think right doesn't matter just.
right okay.
that's me vertically.
right.
and then you go along left about an inch just a straight line.
and underneath there's a a slate mountain.
no.
i don't have a slate mountain i've got a white mountain.
oh right.
ehm after you've gone along your inch you know you start going downwards towards the left ehm.
downwards towards.
a kind of forty-five degree line about an inch and a half down kind of sloping.
right.
and you should be more to the left-hand side of the page now.
er.
kind of just off centre.
yeah.
right.
well.
no.
about i'm about centre never mind.
right that's okay.
and just after you've gone down your slope do another short line about an inch to your left just a straight line along.
right.
and there's some hot wells above this.
no.
no no.
there's some hot springs below but never mind.
oh right erm.
now you should be about maybe two inches from the left-hand side.
no.
no.
where are you.
maybe three and a half.
three and a half inches.
right.
right.
now we're going kind of down about another inch.
am i meant to be a-- away over the left-hand side.
uh-huh.
well.
if i go down an inch i can't 'cause i'll go right through a hot spring i'll need to go further along.
oh.
i'll just take the line further along to the left.
yeah.
right right.
right.
wh-- tell me where are where you are now.
halfway up the page a couple of inches off the left-hand side.
right.
you seem to be kind of down a wee bit i think it doesn't matter.
now.
the line just goes straight up now kind of sloping towards the right.
oh great.
ehm.
through mm-hmm.
but it goes up quite far it goes up goes up to about ehm.
but this is not making sense because i'm just going to be doubling back on myself and there's no like obstacles or anything never mind.
ehm.
what have i to do.
wait a minute.
the line that that i've just done which kind of goes from the right-hand side to the left-hand side is kind of sloping downwards right.
no.
i is it.
yeah.
right.
and that kind of g-- that kind of takes you to th-- to the left-hand side of the page right.
mmhmm.
and the line now should be going right up kind of a vertical line.
vertical line.
up quite high it'll go up to about the top third of the page sloping slightly at the end of your line to the right.
what so it's going up vertically and then sloping.
sloping just at the end.
at the right and you should be just about the top third of the page.
ehm no.
no.
i had to avoid a mountain so.
oh is th-- is there a white mountain there.
yes.
yeah you should be kind of.
what sh-- what side should i be.
just at the left of that.
the left-hand side of it.
uh-huh.
yeah i've i've went round the left of that.
oh right okay well.
but i'm a bit high i think.
see the line should kind of slope towards the right.
uh-huh.
level to the top of the mountain.
right.
uh-huh.
and then it should go straight up from there about an inch and a half just a straight line up.
right.
and is there any obstacles there.
no none on mine.
there is on mine there's round rocks.
right.
right i'm going up i've done that.
right.
now you should be about maybe an inch and a half from the top of the page.
yeah well right.
yeah right.
just make it a bit longer.
and then we go about two inches straight along to your right.
is there any obstacles there.
mm no.
right i've done that.
and then ehm just just to the right of this on mine th-- there's a lake.
mmhmm that's right.
is that there.
well you you sh-- you.
it's about the first thing that has.
right and.
you take your line right round the outside of the lake.
the far right.
so i'm going up.
so you're going up.
round.
mmhmm.
down.
right.
just circle the lake.
yeah just uh-huh.
until you're kind of maybe half an inch down from the the left-hand side of the lake.
see what i mean.
mm i so i'm going vertically like the last i'm going round the lake and then taking it down half an inch past the lake taking the line pa--.
well y-- ehm wait a wee minute.
you don't quite take it.
know where yours says lake.
yeah.
you don't quite take it right round up kind of goes straight along.
oh i see.
see what i mean.
ah well see my line's below well on parallel with the lake so i've had to take it up draw it up and then round.
uh-huh right.
right.
that'll be alright.
so then what do i do.
okay and then underneath this line there's roman baths.
mm.
do you have them.
no.
no.
well.
mine goes after you've taken your li-- rou-- line round it's kind of like a circle but it's it's not joined.
mmhmm.
it goes down maybe.
oh it's nearly like a circle circling right round.
well.
it but it's not joined there's about an inch between the two lines.
oh.
right what what do i do after that.
erm.
see where your your horizontal line at at the top stops just before you go round the lake.
mmhmm.
see if you just go directly down from that erm there should be a vertical line about two and a half inches just at at the beginning of the lake.
mmhmm.
you loop down about an inch below that.
and what about.
carry on your line down about two and a half inches just straight down.
where the lake starts where.
yeah uh-huh wher-- where the lake starts but.
right.
put put your finger on where the lake starts.
right.
where it.
the wee bit that sticks up.
mmhmm.
a-- and go down about an inch.
right.
which is where your line should be kind of passing through.
oh i see i see.
right.
and then from there you kind of go down about two and a half inches.
right okay right.
right.
and do you have antelopes.
yes mmhmm.
it should be kind of erm the line should be going round the antelopes.
what way.
to towar-- to your right your line should be at the left of the antelopes.
oh i came o-- okay right.
right.
mmhmm.
and just carry on round the antelopes a-- and about an inch and a half just draw a line about an inch and a half to your right and that's your finish.
from the antelopes an inch and a half.
uh-huh.
you done this one before.
no.
oh super.
you'll have no chapel.
"okay ""a"" ""q"" ""7"" ""c"" ""8"" plus minus ""4"" ""u"" david."
and mark.
right.
you've got the start point.
yeah.
up high on the left-hand side yeah.
yeah.
eh you got a haystack.
just there.
just below it.
to the right to left.
well.
take a curve well.
you know where the c-- er the carpenter's house is.
yes.
well take about a couple of inches well about an inch a couple of inches just just below the start of it do a curve which just about meets the haystack and eh goes to just eh directly below a level with jus-- just below level with the start eh the carpenter's house.
so you go if i curve from the start round to.
so you're doing it's like a.
it's like.
just along and.
"a backwards ""c""."
mm.
just beside the haystack meets the haystack just about about half a centimetre from the haystack and comes out to below the start line just below the level of the carpenter's house.
right.
you've got.
you got the.
directly below the start.
mmhmm.
yeah.
right.
then you've got about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house.
right.
you've got that point do you want to mark a point there.
right.
there's.
right.
and you go from the start.
so you've.
so about you.
carpenter house from.
start and you do a curve about half a centimetre from the haystack down to the point.
down to the point just at the side of the carpenter's house.
yeah.
so just curving round down it like that.
just under the start.
no.
it's just under the start the point just under start and just under carpenter's house.
oh.
right.
so you're it's it's going just it's eventually going to end up just below the start line but it's half a centimetre under the carpenter's house.
half a centimetre under the carpenter's house right.
so.
so we're down below the carpenter's house about half a centimetre.
on the level.
yeah.
but across below the start.
see what i mean.
oh away round here below the start.
yeah.
so it's that's the level you're going to.
ah right.
"so it sort of curves round like that backwards ""c"" as you've said."
it's not.
it's just to the le-- it's to the left of the haystack it's just a really shallow thing.
doesn't sound like what i've got.
right.
you sti--.
right.
we'll start again then.
you've got the start line right.
this is a good one.
and you've eh.
well.
you're going to end up directly below the start line.
okay.
mmhmm.
so down below.
down below start line.
mm.
now.
you want to.
the point below the start line is level with about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house.
mmhmm.
yeah.
right okay.
so you've got about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house draw a line across to below the start line.
right.
right.
drawn that if.
it's across.
well don't draw a line draw a point there sorry.
okay.
and you want to.
right.
i've started.
so from the start i'm going what direction.
you're going down towards the haystack.
down towards the haystack.
and you're missing the l-- haystack on the left by about half a centimetre.
on the left.
on the left.
on the left of the haystack yeah.
so i'm coming down past the left.
uh it's it's just a shallow.
yeah.
a shallow curve to that point down there.
uh-huh right okay.
right.
you want to go about an an inch to the right towards the carpenter's house.
an inch to the right right.
and then you want to go up.
up.
yeah.
you want eh green bay.
have you got green bay no right at the top.
green bay.
no.
no.
well you want to go up.
so you're going up p-- on the right-hand side of the hi-- haystack.
yeah you're d-- well let me see i'll tell you in a minute.
see the carpenter's house.
mmhmm.
you've got the left-hand side of the roof.
right.
well you've got about an inch from the top of that just less than an inch.
mmhmm.
and you mark a point there.
right.
right.
and join up the two points.
so you've gone th-- start down to shallow curve round the haystack and along to that point.
yeah.
yeah.
that's directly below the start.
yeah.
below the s-- directly below the start.
mm.
no.
no.
right.
from the beginning again.
right.
i think you're murdered.
you're going directly below the start but you're taking a curve that just misses the haystack.
mmhmm.
it's just a really really sh-- shallow curve.
yeah.
right you've got that.
you're going so you're going d-- you're going down your star-- your starting point.
you've got that in.
you're going starting down.
you just go down curve round the bottom of the haystack.
and then you curve round the other way and you come to the bottom jus--.
and you you come to the the roof a point where the roof of the carpenter's house left-hand side.
an inch above it.
well.
right.
from the start you're starting directly below the start point is where you want to go that well make that the first move.
you got that you got that it's shallow curve.
right.
shallow curve i've got.
i go down just and curve round the haystack.
well not round.
you want to finish below the starting point you go down you curve past you curve past the haystack.
so just a wee.
"it's like a an inverted ""c""."
so i'm curving back like.
"it's like a ""c"" the wrong way round."
well i'm just curving back in.
yeah.
you're coming round to besi-- to below the start point which is also on a level below the carpenter's house that's to tell you where to stop.
all right.
so i'm actually i'm starting here and i'm finishing.
directly below start.
so it's just a wee shallow curve.
aye.
well i'll have to miss the blacksmith i've got a blacksmith's right okay that's.
that's you.
okay so you should just be about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house right.
a lot of rubbing scribbling going on here.
so you're half a centimetre below the carpenter's house you're on that level.
right.
mmhmm.
right okay.
so you come across an inch from that point.
to the right.
to the right.
right.
and that's about an inch from the carpenter's house as well.
sec.
yeah.
yeah.
a wee bit further.
now.
you've got that point in then yes.
yeah.
so you want to go up.
you see the carpenter's house the roof the left-hand point of the roof.
mmhmm.
so i want to go up to.
so you want to go up.
there's an inch above there right just maybe a bit less than an inch.
right.
right so a--.
and you want to join that point those two points up and that's in a sort of thirty thirty degree angle or something like that.
so it's a sort of diagonal.
right okay i'll just.
right.
right.
just take it across about one two two inches it's slightly below and eastern.
right.
so one easter and we're going.
slightly below it two inches slightly below east it's about like ninety five degrees.
yeah.
right.
right.
and you've got the seven beeches.
yeah.
see you're about an inch above the seven beeches and about an inch to the left of the seven beeches that right.
no i'm not an inch above them.
to the carpent-- the carpenter's house an inch above the c-- top left corner is is on a level with that the top of the seven beeches so now i've gone down.
not an inch above them.
well you want to be about call it half an inch above the seven beeches.
right so i'll just.
right.
right okay.
"and from that point there you want to go about it's just off south to below the ""s"" in seven beeches."
just off south.
"it's southeast you want to be going right just below the ""s""."
southeast mmhmm.
"right down that way just below the ""s"" wait a minute."
right.
"just below the ""s""."
now eh.
you've got reclaimed fields down below that.
yeah i have.
down below.
well.
in between the seven beeches and the reclaimed fields i've got a chapel.
okay.
mm right.
i don't have that.
so.
"eh what i need to do is i need to go round it again an inverted ""c"" well it's no an inverted ""c"" it's li-- the other way about opposite ""c""."
right.
and you need to go around it so eh.
so i sort of curve underneath seven beeches and round and then over to back to where i started from.
yeah so you.
the the actual point where you want to finish up is eh.
you see the the thick tree trunk on the right-hand side of the seven beeches.
mmhmm.
the the the furthest right one.
so you want to finish.
yeah.
you want to finish about two inches below that.
right.
hold on to.
which is about h-- about a centimetre above the reclaimed fields.
does that make sense to you.
mm.
no.
the reclaimed fields are quite a distance away.
miles below it yeah.
aye.
well eh.
we'll call it just about two inches maybe a bit more call it two and a half inches below the tree trunk.
right.
mmhmm.
and that's where you e-- want to finish up.
right.
"so to do that you'll need to take from the ""s"" and go round like from twelve o'clock to three o'clock."
yeah around.
and go out an inch.
and then.
and then back in again.
"from the ""s""."
and then back into that point i told you.
yeah.
right.
got that.
s-- now.
you want to go like the end of a test tube like that way you want to go round the reclaimed fields like that.
have you got crane bay.
crane bay yeah.
"you see the m-- the most northerly tip above the ""b""."
over the right yeah.
well.
"you want to come round the test round the reclaimed fields and the test tube sh-- sort of shape to about oh i don't know about an inch and a half above the ""b""."
an inch.
"above the ""b""."
"above the ""b"" yeah."
well.
so the point right.
no.
above the point sorry.
above the tip.
have you got whitewashed cottage.
no.
no.
so i'll have to miss that.
so.
if i come round in my curve and then i'm going along and then curving back round the same way.
yeah.
so the shape will be you'll be going east and then you'll be going down.
"a kind of inverted in a ""s"" a backwards ""s""."
it's not.
well prob--.
sort of.
it's just like that shape you want to do so you're going east and then you're going that curve and then you're going west until you're above that.
tip.
ah well.
"the whole thing in together like from the seven beeches round it's like an ""c"" and then and it's like a normal ""c"" sort of."
right i'll try and an inch and a half above there i'll have to draw it a bit s-- squint.
so i'm so i'm coming down on the right-hand the left-hand side of the reclaimed fields.
yeah.
and i've sort of s-- curved round to about there.
so you've got you've gone round the reclaimed fields.
mmhmm.
and you're about an inch and a half above the tip the northern-most tip.
yeah about an inch.
now.
you want to go south down to that northern-most tip.
right.
right.
just off to the left-hand side of it.
okay.
right.
and you want to follow the contours of the bay round to the first.
well you know how it it sort of goes down in a curve.
uh-huh.
and then you get a southern a dead south it goes almost due south.
yeah.
well you want to follow the contours round to that point.
just skirt it along.
right.
i'm just ready to go south.
right.
so now.
have you got vast meadow and attractive cliff really close.
no.
i've got attractive cliffs which are round.
right.
well you want to go.
see where it goes di-- due south.
uh-huh.
and then it almost goes due west.
yeah.
well you want to do a straight line about a centimetre you want yeah you've got that point come down the due south and come across the west.
so skirting skirting along.
yeah.
no eh.
just straight line.
just a cen-- you want to do a centimetre above d-- the western-most tip right and draw a straight line from where you've stopped now.
you know when y--.
uh-huh so it's right.
so it's just like a straight line from the south that bit there where it goes due south to about a centimetre above.
that's right.
right.
so it's about that sort of angle.
uh-huh.
now.
"you want to go due west until you're above the ""a"" in attractive cliffs."
right.
and then take it down about about the same angle as you took from the south to the west tip.
take that down to the bottom just on the same level as attractive cliffs so you're doing down that angle and it's about an inch long shall we say.
right.
right.
right you got that.
now.
in here you've got something to miss out haven't you.
crashed spaceship.
crashed spaceship.
so you want to go west of the crashed space the crashed spaceship.
right over to its west.
you want over to its west.
almost to the edge of the paper.
yeah down the edge of the paper.
right.
just just past it.
to just.
to the level of a chestnut tree.
yeah.
when you get to chestnut tree curve round and go to about half an inch from the bottom of the chestnut tree.
top.
half an inch from the bottom.
right.
so i curve round oh so i'm on its left-hand side and i'm out about half an inch bef-- bottom.
yeah.
you go up about half the trunk of the chestnut tree to the dimple in the chestnut tree.
you see the dimple in the chestnut tree.
the dimple uh.
halfway up the trunk just before the.
aye.
the branches start.
the branches.
right okay.
you've got that's only about like a centimetre long.
so.
and that's your finish point.
mmhmm.
so i've taken my cur-- i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point.
about half an inch.
above.
no.
you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree.
yeah.
and you s-- then you go due north.
oh right.
i've go to the bo-- i go to the base of the tree.
from there you c-- half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk.
curve around.
all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at the.
right.
right.
and that's it there.
and that's your finish.
so your the finish point should be level with where the branches start.
uh-huh right.
that right.
i think we got that wee bit in a bit sh-- stramash.
i know aye start.
right.
do you have the start marked just above the diamond mine yeah.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
okay.
eh s-- straight down 'til you're just underneath the diamond mine and horizontally along under the diamond mine along.
you don't have the graveyard.
the what.
graveyard.
no.
no.
if you go ehm i'd say about you have carved stones.
mmhmm.
right.
ehm carry on horizontally underneath the diamond mine for about ehm 'til you get from about an inch away from the carved stones and then up above the carved stones.
right.
okay.
straight down the right-hand side of the carved stones.
ehm do you have indian country.
mmhmm.
no yeah.
if you go down.
do you have a great rock.
nope.
along from.
right okay.
go down to the top of indian country.
mmhmm.
eh diagonally t-- down eh southwest 'til you're ehm underneath indian country about two inches away from it on your left.
say that again.
right go to indian country go horizontally along from it two inches and join a line from above it to.
right.
are you at the top of indian country.
yeah.
right slope down ehm towards the left.
okay.
mmhmm.
and then horizontally along above the gold mine.
mmhmm.
ehm round the left-hand side of the gold mine direct-- down for about five inches.
past the totem pole.
i haven't got a totem pole.
eh 'til you're i would imagine 'til you're underneath the totem pole then.
right.
ehm you have a trout farm.
nope.
cavalry.
right now.
no ca--.
oh wait a minute wait a minute i've got a trout farm.
okay.
ehm if you go.
but where is it your trout farm.
ehm the right-hand side of the page.
mmhmm.
right okay.
if you kind of go curve down and then.
oh so you're five inches below the gold mine.
sort of.
r--.
i'm no sure how much an inch is to be honest but there we go.
right okay eh.
have you if you're underneath the totem pole then.
right.
is totem pole below the trout farm.
no i--.
well it's kind of opposite it.
opposite it right.
go below the the totem pole then then and then acro-- horizontally across the page underneath the trout farm.
b-- below it.
mmhmm.
then round 'til you're about an inch from the side two centimetres from the side of the page the trout farm.
oops.
right.
and straight down.
towards the cattle stockade.
uh-huh.
straight down and underneath the cattle stockade.
mmhmm.
round underneath the cattle stockade curve up on a wee kind of hill.
right.
and then underneath the bandit territory.
underneath it.
uh-huh.
and then are you under the bandit territory.
mmhmm.
right.
just go s-- ehm to the left the bandit territory go north until you get to eh just about level to where the top of his the tree is.
and that's the finish.
what tree.
the tree in the bandit territory.
the cactus.
uh-huh.
to about the top of it.
uh-huh.
is that the finish.
yeah.
phew.
okay.
right.
you're at the start.
mmhmm.
and i want you to go down towards the bottom of the page past the site of the forest fire.
okay.
which side will i pass it on.
on the left.
okay.
go down and go underneath the picnic site.
i don't have a picnic site.
well it's d-- eh gosh.
how many inches down from the forest fire should i go.
it's i--.
well it's a couple of inches from the bottom of the page.
right.
'kay.
"so ehm i want you to do a ""u"" round it."
"do a ""u"" round it."
yeah.
to come back up ehm on the right-hand side of it.
okay.
"so are you going down the way the way i would normally write a ""u""."
am i what.
are you underneath it or above it.
well if you started off and you came down the page you went underneath it and go back up the other side of it upwards.
ah right okay.
okay.
go past the adventure playground.
underneath it.
no.
ehm up the side of it on the left of it.
okay.
and then turn right and go along to about the centre of the page in a straight line.
right.
ehm well a wee bit past the centre of the page.
'kay.
then turn to your left and go upwards.
mmhmm.
until you reach the granite quarry and turn left round the granite quarry over the top of it.
right.
and come back down to go just above the top of the train crossing.
don't have a train crossing.
right well eh.
well i do have a train crossing at the top.
well don't go up there.
ehm right.
we've just come round the top of the granite quarry.
right.
and if you come down eh.
on the right side of it.
mm.
or the left side of it.
on the left side of it.
just a wee bit.
eh right.
and then go s-- straight along towards the left-hand side of the page.
right.
and then turn up to the right and go past the waterfall.
right.
on its right-hand side.
on its left-hand side sorry.
on its left-hand side right.
and at the top of the waterfall turn right g-- just go along to the edge of the waterfall.
right.
and then turn left and go upwards for a w--.
mmhmm.
a couple of strokes and then turn right.
uh-huh.
go along about an inch.
a--.
ehm how how far was i going above the waterfall.
ehm.
couple of inches.
yeah.
right.
and then come down in an a diagonal line towards the right down to about half.
goes towards the public footpath.
i don't have a public footpath.
mm right s--.
do you have a fallen cairn.
no i don't.
well it's about halfway down the page but.
halfway down the page.
on the right.
oh i do have a fallen cairn yes uh-huh.
right.
so i'm coming diagonally down.
uh-huh.
from the waterfall.
to go underne-- well from above the waterfall.
uh-huh.
to go underneath the fallen cairn.
from there.
mmhmm.
a straight line.
aye.
well diagonal one.
uh-huh.
mmhmm.
right.
okay.
that's weird.
and then er turn after you've been underneath the fallen cairn.
mmhmm.
turn left and go back up the other side of it.
mmhmm.
up past the limestone cliffs.
don't have any.
e-- ehm.
so i'm going up to my left for or straight up for how many inches.
well lean slightly to the left and go up for a couple of inches.
right.
and then go straight up towards east lake.
rightee-ho.
and then turn left when you reach east lake.
mmhmm.
and go along to the finish.
which is where.
just on the left-hand side of east lake.
at the the jutty-out bit.
mmhmm.
okey-doke.
right.
that's me i think.
you got a start which is above a diamond mine.
yep.
yeah.
yep.
yeah.
well if you draw a line from the start from the left-hand side of the cross.
uh-huh.
straight down to an inch below th-- the diamond mine.
right okay right.
you don't have a wagon wheel do you.
no.
i've got a swamp on the left-hand side.
no.
yeah.
and i've got rapids just directly below the rap-- the the diamond wine mine about another say two inches or so three inches maybe.
you've got a rift valley at the top.
yep.
top right-hand side.
draw a line along to your right.
mmhmm.
how far.
like uh like a horizontal line.
uh-huh.
have you got a cactus.
no.
draw it along to the cactus.
right okay.
right.
and then.
if you go if you go straight up along to your right and down through the the centre of the rift valley.
like through the midpoint of the rift valley.
alright right okay.
so you're going down into the rift valley.
right minute okay.
yeah.
then.
you've got rocks.
yep.
below your rift valley.
mmhmm.
and you don't have a stone creek though do you.
nope.
you got something there.
whereabouts.
just like along from the rocks it's to the left of the rocks.
i've got rapids and just past the middle middle left say.
right okay.
i've got white water which'll be the same as the rapids.
yeah.
but above just above it and to the right i've got a stone creek.
no.
i don't have anything like that.
so you're wanting to go betwee-- down to from the rift valley down passing the left-hand side of the rocks and then going just above the white water.
do i want to go under do you these your rocks you've got they've whatever it is.
what is it you've got just above the rapids.
a stone creek.
so you want to go under it.
so i want to go under that.
so you're just like going just above the white water.
right.
and then you should be on the left-hand side of the white water.
yep.
so you want to come down straight down until you're about two inches.
do you have an outlaws' hideout.
i've got from the bottom i've got saloon bar stone creek manned fort.
manned fort.
do you have a noose.
down on the right-hand side.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
you've got an outlaws' hideout above the noose.
oh yeah right uh-huh.
yeah.
uh-huh.
well.
do you want to come straight down from the white water 'til you're about.
my white water's on the left-hand side of the map.
uh-huh.
so i'm cutting right across to the.
no.
come come straight down in a straight line.
oh tom.
until just below until you're about.
just below the line of white the outlaws' hideout.
yeah just keep below.
right okay i'm there.
and then come along sort of sweeping up to right underneath the outlaws' hideout so you're crossing the whole page.
right okay.
that's ab-- oh you don't have the fort.
where's the fort.
s--.
it's just it's like um.
is it underneath the stone creek like directly underneath.
no it's above.
i've got a saloon bar directly under beneath the stone creek on the left-hand side.
so is it to your right of the stone creek and just up a bit.
no.
to my left and up a wee bit.
to your left and up a wee bit.
i've got erm.
you got stone slabs.
yeah.
in the centre.
right it's left it's above that it's about the same.
mmhmm.
do you have a gold mine.
no.
oh i've got a gold like a mine between my outlaw's hideout hideout and the noose.
and you've got stone slabs as well.
and i've got stone slabs.
the the out-- the gold mine is to the same right as the m-- manned fort is to the left and the gold mine is right in but practically in the middle between the outlaws' hideout and the noose.
okay.
so i want to come across 'til i'm underneath the outlaws' hideout.
yeah.
so it's like it should be a sort of diagonal line going up to get to it and you're at a lower point on the left-hand side.
oh right.
i must be going underneath the i'm going underneath the fort then because that's underneath.
and the line's.
okay.
and your sort of line's gradually s-- sloping up.
right.
uh-huh.
'til it gets quite close the ide-- outlaws' hideout.
okay that's where i am.
and then the line's going like straight down and past the noose.
alright so if you've got something in the way there you'll have to go right round it.
okay.
is this is it to the the right-hand side of the noose.
but nearer the side of the page.
yeah.
right.
yeah.
okay i'm underneath the noose.
okay.
i've got a swan's pond.
which you won't have.
no.
don't have anything.
erm it's about it's like on the same line as the saloon bar.
right okay.
but underneath the stone slabs.
right okay.
so you'll need to go round it kind of thing like up and round it.
i've got it.
over it.
yeah.
okay.
am i heading down towards the saloon bar.
and then.
yeah.
and then you're going right round under the under the saloon bar up to the finish and that's us.
where's the finish.
have you not got a finish cross.
nope.
no.
the finish cross is directly.
know how you can see the roof of the saloon bar.
yeah.
about an inch along is the centre point of that cross.
so if you take line right up to about there.
right okay.
that's okay right that's it.
okay that's it.
okay right this is off.
do you have a start.
up at crane bay.
yeah start.
yeah.
on the san-- on the sandy shore.
on the.
yeah.
do you have a well.
a well.
on the corner sandy shore comes down and round to the mouth of the river.
do you follow me.
no i don't have i don't have a well.
do you have local residents.
yeah.
i've got a b-- er two little houses with local residents underneath.
right okay.
well.
s-- do you see the corner where the the shore the crane bay comes down and then turns in.
yes.
before it comes into the mouth of the river.
yes.
well right on that corner i've got a well.
oh yeah uh-huh.
and i want you to bring the line down but.
right.
cut out as if you're going round a well.
okay.
so i go down and then round towards local residents.
yep.
okay.
cut ut er up on up the left-hand side of local residents up to the corner where of crane bay.
do you see what i mean.
yeah.
so i'm now i go underneath the local residents.
no.
no.
no.
cut on the left-hand side of the residents.
yeah okay.
right.
go up there.
go up towards the iron bridge.
to the point.
see where the point is.
oh yeah yeah yeah.
go up as if you're can cross over the iron bridge or whatever it is you've got there.
so i g-- i'm going to cross over the iron bridge.
cross over the bridge.
right okay.
okay.
yeah.
now.
what do you have on that side.
i have woodland.
right well.
don't go near that i want you to follow the course of the river.
right.
yeah.
right down to the fork just above the fork.
just above the fork.
where where the dead tree is.
uh-huh.
above that you know before before the river forks.
just.
be-- before the river forks okay.
uh-huh.
right.
right i've got it.
now.
do you have farmed land.
farm land.
just there just to the right of the tree.
no.
right well i've got f--.
i've mountain stream.
and the lagoon on the other s-- the lagoon right.
yes.
well.
on the s-- you're on the side of the mountain stream aren't you.
yeah yeah.
right.
"well i want you to do a back-- a backwards ""c"" as if you're you're going round farmland and cutting the river cutting across the stream just below the dead tree."
right.
okay.
so that ins-- stop when you get to the bottom of the dead tree.
so remind me what i'm i'm i've got to go underneath the dead tree.
no.
from where you are right.
just at the fork before the fork of the river.
yeah.
yes.
"i want you to do a back-- a backwards ""c""."
right.
right.
cutting just at don't cross the river the other way from the river.
yeah okay.
see what i mean.
and cut the river or the stream below the level of the trees so that you're stopping just under the tree.
okay right.
so i go undern-- and now i'm underneath the tree.
you're now underneath the tree.
okay.
yeah i've got it.
right.
now i want you to go directly south for about seven centimetres about two inches.
right.
right.
have you got treas-- er tr-- buried treasure.
no.
okay.
then i want you to go directly west no to your just say to your left for about the same amount to bring you up to the shore of the lagoon.
yeah.
yeah i've got it.
right.
now follow the lagoon round to the tip.
see the bottom of the little lagoon.
yeah got it.
right.
take it round to there.
yeah.
right now.
green bay see green bay.
yes i've got that.
with the pirate ship.
of the pirate ship.
right.
yeah.
do you have a rock fall.
no.
right.
well f--.
see if you follow the coast of that on the right-hand side no sorry the left-hand side of the map.
yes.
all the way down right.
yes yes.
do you see the the point before it turns into green bay.
yes.
right.
i want you to take your line from the bottom of the lagoon.
to there.
sort of but.
make sure you sort of um curve it up a wee bit so that you're missing i-- 'cause i've got rocks.
okay.
so curve it up a wee bit.
towards it and get to that point.
up.
and then go to that point.
yeah.
right i'm there.
right.
so you're like on the coast before you turn into green bay.
yeah.
i've got it.
right.
now beside the pirate ship i've got a cross like for the finish.
beside the pirate ship.
yeah.
just to the left of the pir--.
so do i have to go round the outside of green bay.
no.
"what you do is you do an ""l"" shape in the water."
in the water.
to get to it just to get to the pirate ship.
by the pir-- so i'm going to the pirate ship.
"you're going you're doing an ""l"" shape to the pirate ship."
yeah i've got you okay.
there that's the finish.
is that that's the end right.
ehm right.
you start at the caravan park.
mmhmm.
right.
ehm if you go down about three inches down uh-huh.
right.
and then across about two and go back up in.
do i go past the picket fence.
no.
right okay.
we're going.
see the old mill can you find the old mill on your map.
the mill wheel.
it's an old mill.
i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thing.
okay right.
so.
i go down from the caravan park bef-- turn right before the picket fence.
you go to the old mill.
there's no picket fence here eh.
you don't have a picket f--.
i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park.
so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it.
well.
no.
i go down and then i turn right n-- no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old.
have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park.
yeah.
it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine.
mm.
and ha-- have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the ca-- you've not to pass that fence.
well.
if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fence.
so then.
right i see.
so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence.
if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first.
where's your.
actually go to it.
well.
mmhmm.
i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort of thing.
hmm.
but is the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill first.
wh-- where wh--.
well.
i you i don't suppose you you you can go outside the picket fence.
eh i i could i could go down about you know two and a half inches and then go right and that would take me underneath my mill wheel right you know beneath it so that not not beneath it n-- on the map beneath it on the map.
right okay.
mmhmm.
you know.
so i can go down and then to the right and and you know another couple of inches and that's me below the mill wheel.
the old mill.
is that okay.
right.
can you can you s-- s-- can you s-- well can you see the abandoned cottage.
yeah.
that's in the middle of my map right in the middle of the page.
uh-huh.
so if mm.
so if you go to the old mill and then y--.
i'd if i need to go beneath the old mill right.
okay.
uh-huh.
further along to the right and then up about six or seven inches 'til you get to the abandoned cottage so i d-- i do that do i.
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm.
so you're going to your right old now going out to your right and then eh straight up to the round the abandoned cottage right.
okay so i right well.
i've not drawn anything yet.
i'll go down from the caravan park right.
mmhmm.
and then right.
is the point so that you it's not so that you d-- you avoid that that fence or have you got to go by that fence.
i've avoided the fence now.
right you have right.
i'm i'm going right under the the mill okay.
uh-huh.
and up now.
no.
you ma-- you're actually meant to over the mill.
over the mill.
uh-huh.
as in on the left-hand side of it you know what i mean like going up round it on the map.
mmhmm.
well.
my caravan park is on the left-hand side of the mill.
uh-huh.
so is this.
right.
so i could ju--.
it's on the it's on the far left isn't it.
yeah my caravan park's on the far left.
uh-huh.
but the mill wheel's to the right of it.
uh-huh that's fine.
so if you you're going to the old mill.
first of all.
mmhmm.
it's the very first place i go.
uh-huh.
well.
i can just draw a line straight between the two then.
right.
yeah but on my map it's not got that it's eh.
you're going in a sort of curve to the bottom of the map then round the old mill.
round beneath the old mill.
uh-huh.
no.
you don't actually go under the old mill you go like round it.
like.
see the side where the steps are.
yeah.
like.
that's how you go just just go round the top.
you actually go round the side where the where the wheel is.
no the other side.
the other side.
uh-huh.
where where the steps are and round the r-- on top of the roof and then you go round to your right.
just keep going right then straight up round the abandoned cottage.
i mean.
surely you could just go you know you could just go straight from the caravan park to the abandoned cottage could you not.
no.
well o-- on the route on this map is you've to go down.
so right so.
i'd b-- i'd have to draw a curve then from the down from the caravan park.
uh-huh.
from the mill wheel and up to the abandoned cottage to the right like a tick shape it'd be s-- the shape of a tick from the the.
no.
the shape of a like an oval shape from the caravan park you start just above the caravans.
right.
right.
mmhmm.
ma-- make mark across above the caravans go round like just like an oval like half an until you come to sort of top of the old mill like say the.
mmhmm.
the corner of the roof.
then up to the abandoned cottage.
then uh-huh.
do a curve right up to your right.
right okay.
right.
i'll draw that.
sort of d-- gradual curve to your right.
right.
eh.
where does it stop.
see where the fenced meadow is.
the bottom right.
uh-huh.
do you go over the abandoned cottage or under it.
well.
see where the fenced meadow is at the bottom of your page.
yeah.
when you go right from the old mill go right and just where eh that you start you come to the beginning of that drawing on the right go straight up round the abandoned cottage.
you're saying you go from the m-- the old mill to the fenced meadow.
no.
you go you're above the fenced meadow the the route is actually above that.
i've g--.
yeah.
okay it's basi-- if.
see if you go over the old mill.
mmhmm.
right you're o-- you're o-- eh over the the roof right.
mmhmm.
and you're going make a gradual slope to your right.
mmhmm.
okay.
quite steep though up the up the way.
no quite just sort a wee gradual one.
towards the forest.
towards fe-- where the hell's the forest.
the forest from.
no.
there there's no forest.
the forest is beneath the abandoned cottage right on on my map.
to get to the fenced meadow i'd need to go down from the mill.
well.
you don't want to go to the fenced meadow anyway.
i'm just telling i'm giving you a g-- i because it's like.
why did you mention it.
you stop you stop going right above the fenced meadow where you come to that drawing.
in other words the the bottom right-hand side of the abandoned cottage.
no.
surely.
no.
well.
right.
you're at the old mill go back to the old mill.
okay.
yeah i'm there.
right.
see the roof.
yeah.
go over the roof.
yeah mmhmm.
keep going right.
right.
'til about th--.
right okay.
let's start again in different terms.
see about three quarters of the way to your right in the page.
mmhmm.
stop right when you've go-- drawn your line from the old mill and then just go straight up and make a line round the abandoned like a circle round the abandoned cottage.
curve round the abandoned cottage and round the roof.
okay.
back towards the left-hand side.
uh-huh.
right okay.
right i've done that i've now got th--.
and s--.
i've now got three lines on my page but i know the one that.
well.
that will that would just.
it's meant to be a sort of continuous curve is it not.
no.
but i mean that that's like this is the third attempt sort of thing.
oh right i see.
okay.
right.
well see where the abandoned cottage is now right you're at the roof of the abandoned co--.
yeah.
i'm above the chimney.
right.
go down say about forty-five degrees on a sort of angle.
yeah.
down.
see where the fenced meadow is besi-- on the left-hand side of the r-- uh-huh the left-hand side of your page.
no m-- mine's.
about halfway up.
no that's not there on mine.
is it not.
my fenced meadow's at the bottom right-hand side.
mmhmm.
i've got two here.
right ehm.
you've got two fenced meadows.
mmhmm.
and no forest.
and no forest.
no.
right.
well.
i've gone round the forest in mine.
have you.
yeah.
but i had to though.
right okay.
may-- aye maybe that's what it is then.
oh right.
see where the see where your caravan park is then.
yeah.
i've got nothing above it i've nothing above the caravan park 'til the the west lake.
have you got something below it.
have you got a ca-- have you got a fence below it.
yeah.
the picket fence.
well.
did you go round it.
no.
i went over the mill the the picket fence er hasn't come into it right yet really.
di--.
well.
see the caravan park.
i-- is there is there a picket fence underneath it.
mmhmm.
well.
could you make a line go round it and then c--.
is it bet-- is it like down and then the old mill's above from it.
yeah.
the the old mill's like northeast of it.
so can you not go round the picket fence and round the old mill do you not have to go round the picket fence no.
i don't think so.
that that's what we did first of all th-- the the the first line.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
when i was asking you whether i could you know i had to eh stop before i got to the picket fence or not so but.
well.
do you not have to go round it.
why it's just a fence.
it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely.
you think so.
maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence.
well.
maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know.
i've got one d-- i've got one i don't know realise why it's there.
right right you went by the abandoned cottage right.
i'm above the chimney just now.
right you're above the chimney.
and if you start going dow-- in an angle about forty-five degrees down.
mm mmhmm.
to the to where the bottom of the abandoned cottage.
right.
right okay.
'til oh right so.
you said you where are you now.
the bottom of the abandoned cottage.
right uh-huh.
but wh-- is there anything on your map beside that then on your left-hand side.
no i've got noth-- no i've got nothing between the caravan park and the west lake on the left-hand side.
well.
can you make sort of like right if you make a sort of.
if you make a sort of like a a forty-five degree angle right for about a couple of inches or something and then you start making a circle you know what if you know what i mean if you've got does a sort of angle then sort of curve round.
have you got a west lake.
yeah.
it's at the top left.
well can you can you make a sort of curve then if after your angle sort of like towards the west lake.
a curve.
whe-- where's your fenced meadow on the left-hand side.
uh-huh.
sort of like you've gone.
mm.
where's your fenced meadow on the left-hand side.
it's about halfway up the page that's wh-- uh-huh it's just about about halfway up the page.
so would you know head sort of for the west lake now avoiding you know.
so if you s-- imagine a fenced meadow in the middle of the page.
and you sort of make a circle round up towards the west lake you go up to the west lake and then.
yeah.
along the left-hand side of the page.
mmhmm.
right.
right up to the top.
no.
you go ri-- you make a a ci-- you make a line up go up.
right.
right okay.
to the ti-- 'til you reach the west lake.
see the curve in the at the bottom of the west lake.
right yeah.
that sort of can you see a round curve.
mmhmm.
go to the the eh furthest point of that like in your left-hand side right about the bottom of that curve.
yeah okay.
and start curving round it.
mmhmm.
ti-- if you if you s--.
can you see a trig point.
no.
no.
ehm.
right have you got the eh the west lake.
so make a curve round the bottom of that curve right so just follow that curve.
mmhmm.
around west lake up to the just up to the point you know.
can you see on the west lake where it goes sort of straight.
yeah.
on the left-hand side.
no oh.
right.
where's your trig point.
do you cross the lake or do you go round it.
just just just go round.
right.
until about.
trying to think wh--.
see right can you not.
see if there's a circle at the bottom know how you've just gone round it.
mmhmm.
and you keep going up 'til about it's a kind of sh-- there's kind of angle.
oh this is really hard.
see where the farmed land is at the top.
yeah.
but that's at the at the right-hand side of my west lake.
uh-huh it's at the right-hand side.
yeah but i'm at the bottom left-hand side of the lake at the moment.
right well.
so are you at the bottom left-hand.
right.
i've just curved round the bottom.
and and you can cu-- you curve round the bottom and keep going up that curve just curve round that.
right.
so right round the top of the page.
no.
that's a-- no.
i'd have to otherwise i'd be in the lake.
se-- can you see a monument.
the monument's on the right-hand side.
yeah.
not all that far from the abandoned cottage in fact.
uh-huh that's what i mean.
and is the nuclear test site above it.
no.
i don't have a nuclear test site.
i've got a golf course.
have you got a golf course.
no.
no.
right.
have you got.
the golf course is just beneath the east lake about an inch or so down.
is it.
yeah.
up from its furthest point.
no.
from eh okay it's about two inches down from where it says east lake in the lake.
right.
there's a golf course it's not that big.
so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think.
well.
let's get round the lake first the west lake.
so.
right.
i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the top.
i take it they're the same shape on the maps then.
they must be.
right.
towards the top of the page unless i cross unless i cross the lake i'd need to go right round it.
right.
west lake isn't exac--.
you don't want to cross the lake.
but how am i going to get to the farmland or any-- or anything else.
you don't want to go to the farmed land.
i just asked if i had if you had farmed land.
so i've to double back on myself.
no.
so what do where.
right.
i'm at the bottom of west lake.
right.
the left-hand side.
uh-huh.
where do i go now.
right.
you you you curve round.
right.
see west lake you can see the curves can't you round west lake.
along the left-hand side.
on the left-hand side right.
mmhmm.
right.
you've just come up from the abandoned cottage right.
mmhmm.
and you've gone straight up.
mmhmm.
to the bottom of west lake.
see directly underneath it where it says west lake.
mmhmm.
oh.
i didn't actually i didn't actually go there.
"see the see see whe-- west lake see where the ""e"" is."
yeah.
mmhmm.
directly under that you can then you see a curve going round to your right it's like a sort of bottom of a circle or something it's quite it's quite rounded.
yeah i know the i know the bit y--.
the bottom right-hand side this is you're talking about.
mmhmm.
"you you talking about the ""e"" in lake."
mmhmm.
right.
oh god i forgot about that.
right.
you go down and just start.
right.
"see where the ""e"" in lake is right and."
go down to the bottom of that start tracing around that then towards your right.
we're going right now.
uh-huh.
oh sorry have you been going right up the other side.
i thought we were.
i thought you were going left.
no.
we're going right.
so we're going from the abandoned cottage to below where it says lake.
right.
you've got you right you went to the abandoned cottage and you did a sort of circle.
right i've done that now.
and i and then i trace it back round.
right okay i'm doing that now.
uh-huh you are.
and you're going round.
around the bottom right-hand corner okay.
yeah.
round the curve and then up.
right.
round that curve and then up.
and you don't have a trig point.
no.
i've got all these lines on my on my map now.
see ehm where you've curved up from west lake do you know where i'm talking about see how there's a kind of sharp turn to the left.
that don't apply.
yeah.
in west lake.
at the top of the lake.
uh-huh.
yeah.
and then you go down there's a kind of a bit you go straight down and then you go back up again.
mmhmm.
if you can follow this.
right so you've went round the corner right.
start again.
the bottom right okay.
and see wh-- how i just said how it goes straight up and it goes down and it goes up.
yeah.
see that bit that goes up.
yeah.
the first time.
mmhmm.
sort of sharp bit.
yeah.
right.
stop following the curve at the bottom of that.
right okay.
okay.
and see when you get to that.
do an angle follow that.
see that sort of straight angle.
mmhmm.
do a straight line going to your towards your your right down to the left-hand side you're going down.
down to the right to my left-hand side.
right okay.
if d-- if you think of a compass so if it would be your ehm eh southwest.
but i'd be in the lake then.
no.
you wouldn't be in the lake you shouldn't.
i stop drawing the curve right.
mmhmm.
you haven't gone right round the lake have you.
no.
"i i started from the ""e"" in the lake."
right.
and eh traced it round the right-hand side and and up the side of west lake.
okay.
uh-huh.
and i've stopped where the first eh the first bit rises.
uh-huh.
at quite a sharp angle i've stopped at th-- at the r-- the right-hand side of that.
the bottom of that.
yeah.
well.
then you're going t--.
how can i go southwest i uh i'd surely be in the lake.
oh east sorry.
southeast right okay.
sorry right uh-huh right.
god it's my directions.
you go east southeast down.
where to.
straight.
have you do you should have a monument.
where's the nuclear test site.
yeah.
right great.
right.
go down there straight and go right and.
do you see where the monument is.
do a straight line to the monument.
straight to the monument.
right okay.
to the bottom of the monument and curve round the monument just now.
and go up again.
and then you're starting to go up uh-huh go up a bit.
right.
where's the nuclear test site.
eh it's just it's almost straight up from the monument a few in-- a few inches.
so it's be-- next to the golf course then.
i don't know where your golf course is.
it's just it's about an inch under the east lake at the bottom of east lake.
yeah.
the golf course is is fairly near there.
so right i.
i'm going down.
okay.
so you've got the monument.
yeah i'm going.
just go st-- down straight line down underneath the monument.
right and.
and then up t-- curve up.
come back up again.
mmhmm.
eh go left for a couple of for about an inch or something.
okay.
how far do i go up here.
eh oh about an inch up from the monu-- just just curve sort of curve round a circle sort of.
so i i g-- i i go left beneath the nuclear test site.
uh-huh.
you want to stay on the left-hand side uh-huh.
sorry.
you want to stay on the left-hand side.
right.
you go round the monument.
right.
and go left.
and s-- go left.
i've i've gone an inch or so up from the monument.
go left.
right.
and then go straight up towards the east lake.
so i go left along the left-hand side of the golf course.
uh-huh.
what bit of east lake do i go up to.
just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve.
i can imagine.
see where the see where the.
nuclear test site is.
the the left-hand side of the east lake at the bottom right.
if you draw a straight line down there that's the edge of the golf course so i can't go any i can't you know.
to the left-hand side of east lake like the very far end of east lake.
i can't.
yeah.
at the bottom.
i can't go any further left sorry further right than that because i've been i c-- i'd need to go through the golf course so i've actually you know that's where i am now more or less been-- beneath that point because that's the like the.
but that's where you're meant to end up underneath east lake.
at at the left-hand side.
uh-huh.
at the bottom.
uh-huh.
so i just go from there now.
no.
that's the finish.
yeah i.
do you know where the farmed land is.
yeah the farmed land's between east and west lake.
yeah.
you go well your finish point's just beside east lake.
mmhmm right okay.
so if you went have you went round curved round the monument.
yeah yeah i've done that.
i i'm at the finish now.
are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've we-- you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake t--.
i've not done that yet.
see where east lake is.
you didn't say that.
yeah.
i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now.
right.
and so i curve round.
are you talking about the very bottom.
no a--.
you talking about the bottom right.
the bottom left.
you've just reached there.
yeah.
but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well.
maybe you go round your golf course.
well.
i've already gone round it.
right.
in one direction.
do you mean i have to go back round it.
no no.
that's the finish.
right see at the the bottom left of east lake.
that's the finish.
that's finish point.
right.
eh well.
just a centimetre past it right to your left.
right.
so i'd ha-- i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test site.
right that's finish point so.
so i take it that must be another s-- they must be between each other.
the line should be between that then.
between the golf course and the nuclear test site.
it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument.
yeah.
yeah mmhmm.
so have you gone round it as in have you gone round it on the right-hand side.
the left-hand side.
so i've i've to go round it on the right-hand side.
uh-huh.
you've you come to the monument and you go round it the golf course trace.
i so i've just i've just to pass the left-hand side of the nuclear test site.
mmhmm mmhmm.
right okay no.
have you got a nuclear test site.
but i-- you told me it was just below ea-- east lake.
it is.
but it's on the right-hand side on the right-hand but exactly under the right-hand side of east lake.
yes okay.
i'm just going up to the right-hand side of the golf course okay now.
so you must like have to trace round it then.
yeah okay.
i take it on the right-hand side so it's between it.
so that's me on the right-hand side of east lake now about a centimetre in from the le-- so-- from the right sorry.
eh.
so i go left now i take it.
so then you just just just just trace underneath the curve to the finish.
right.
one centimetre to the left.
uh-huh yeah.
right that's the ve-- the finish point.
of east lake have you traced under the east lake.
that's the finish.
yeah.
so that's us finished.
i think so.
right.
right.
the start's just above the telephone kiosk.
right.
on the left yeah uh-huh.
right.
go down past the left side of the telephone kiosk.
uh-huh.
right down.
right down.
for about ten centimetres.
mmhmm.
now.
right down.
my map there's a stone circle.
there's a stone circle.
yeah.
so.
what you do is.
there's no stone circle here there's a broken gate to the right.
if you.
yeah.
well.
i've got a stone circle marked on mine.
so you need to go underneath it so where you go is you go down the left-hand side.
it's directly underneath the telephone kiosk.
uh-huh.
right so you it's.
down about ten centimetres which should bring you right well i'll tell you p-- put it about twelve you're about two centimetres up from the bottom.
mmhmm.
of this of the paper.
uh-huh right.
and go left for about five.
okay.
centime-- no right for about five i mean.
'cause that would take.
right.
that's towards.
towards the gate.
but.
then stop when you're.
you said five towards the gate.
but the gate's on the r-- is on the right to on the l-- e--.
uh-huh that's what i mean.
you're five five centimetres right.
okay right fine.
right just straight along.
uh-huh.
to the gate.
'til you're directly underneath the left-hand side of the gate.
d-- undernea--.
okay right uh-huh.
right.
move straight up.
mmhmm.
and m-- go up past the left-hand side of the gate.
mmhmm.
'til you're abo-- right above it.
mmhmm.
are you there.
uh-huh.
right.
have you got you've got overnight stop or something haven't you.
overnight accommodation yeah.
to the right.
right.
well.
t-- go up to there.
up to there okay right.
underneath it or just over it or what.
it doesn't matter as long as you're just about at it.
okay.
uh-huh.
right.
now go.
have you got the ruined monastery.
uh-huh.
right at the top.
go up.
to the top of that.
uh-huh.
'til you're right above it.
mmhmm.
you know above the centre.
uh-huh t--.
and go over and down the other side and go down diagonally about three centimetres.
right down uh-huh three centimetres.
right.
got to watch.
'cause there's a lake west lake i don't think.
there's no lake here.
i know.
'cause i did this one earlier.
no okay right.
right so.
what you do is you go up sort of take up diagonally left on a very very slight angle eh for about five centimetres until you're underneath the stile.
have you got a stile.
uh-uh.
i've got a dutch elm.
isn't that over the other side.
mmhmm.
oh the stile's there right okay.
right.
well you're going down there and you go along until you're underneath the left-hand side of the stile and then go up and over the top of it and stop there.
mmhmm.
are you there.
uh-huh.
right.
yeah.
go up about three centimetres direct straight up.
uh-huh.
and then along about two to the right.
mmhmm.
and you go down diagonal ano-- and underneath the bottom of dead tree which'll be the dutch elm probably.
you there.
the stile right i've got a stile i've to go up or whatever i've got the popular tourist spot on that side.
well.
avoid it then.
uh-huh.
and go right down to the e-- right to the what the dutch elm.
underneath the dead tree.
uh-huh.
right now.
go round to the top of the dead tree going up the the right-hand side.
mmhmm yeah.
right.
have you got a great viewpoint just underneath the east lake.
ehm.
i've got the rocket launch pad underneath the east lake.
hmm.
right well.
i've got two great viewpoints.
'cause i've got the great viewpoint to the r-- left-hand to the right to the left-hand side of the east.
yeah.
well.
i've got t-- i've got one there and i've got ano-- another one under the lake.
i think maybe it might be a printing mistake.
yeah okay.
what do i do.
right what you you do is go about two centimetres up diagonally from where you are you should be right directly above the dead tree.
mmhmm.
right.
go up about two centimetres diagonally.
mmhmm.
and then.
"'til and then straight up to the lake you should be just about under the ""e"" of the lake."
"under the ""e"" of the lake."
"under ""e"" it says east lake."
okay yeah fine.
right.
at the bottom of the lake.
mmhmm.
right.
follow the lake up to the left.
uh-huh.
right.
to the left okay.
and stop at the bo-- when it reache-- when it turns a corner ninety degrees stop right.
the first corner or the second corner.
the first corner.
uh-huh okay fine.
when you're going up the left.
uh-huh.
and then go for go about another two centimetres following the same route you were taking.
mmhmm.
just going past the bottom.
mmhmm.
until you should be underneath the the.
you know see how the lake goes up diagonal it go--.
mmhmm.
it goes up diagonal after it turns ninety degrees it turns another corner.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
right and there's another corner there.
uh-huh.
you should be directly under that and that's the finish.
okay fine.
is is that it.
okay.
the start's above the crest falls.
right.
you start there and go to the left.
mmhmm.
a bit and then down by the side of the crest falls.
and then along roughly horizontally to about an inch from the left-hand side of the page then go up.
an inch from the left-hand side of the page.
yeah.
past the banana tree.
well i've not got a banana tree on mine.
okay.
and then to where.
and then go up the way by about four inches three inches.
three inches okay.
have you got baboons marked on yours.
no.
no right.
have you got a footbridge marked.
i have.
okay.
well turn right so that you go across the footbridge.
turn right so i go across the footbridge right.
and watch out beyond it.
have you got a poisoned stream marked.
no.
no right.
well just beyond the footbridge is a poisoned stream.
right.
so and are you on the footbridge footbridge.
mmhmm.
okay.
well go to the end of the footbridge.
right.
and then down.
straight down.
straight down by about an inch.
okay.
bit more than an inch.
right.
eh now go horizontally along towards your right.
for how long.
about three inches.
have you got an old temple marked.
i do.
right okay.
well you go up the left-hand side of the old temple as you see it.
straight up or.
straight up yeah.
curve round.
okay.
okay eh.
now have you got something marked eh just above the old temple or to the left of the old temple.
i've got slate mountain.
slate mountain okay.
well go above that and round.
straight up.
still going to your left.
still going to my left.
y-- well y-- you're straight up just beyond the old temple.
uh-huh.
okay.
now g-- you're wanting to go left.
have you got an abandoned truck marked.
uh-huh.
right.
well you're wanting to go just below that but missing out any obstacles.
right so i'm going underneath this mountain and along to the abandoned truck not underneath the mountain above the mountain.
that there are.
above the mountain yeah.
so it's to the right of the mountain that i'm going.
no it's to the.
the abandoned truck's to the left of the old temple.
yes.
but the m-- the mountain's a-- between the abandoned truck and the old temple.
right okay.
so is the the mountain roughly level with the abandoned truck.
more or less yes.
more or less okay.
go above the the mountain.
right.
and then dip down under the abandoned truck.
okay.
so you're under the abandoned truck.
i'm under the abandoned truck.
go along to the left-hand edge of the abandoned truck.
right.
and then down by.
have you got baboons marked.
no.
no okay.
go eh about an inch down after the abandoned truck.
right.
inch and a half say.
okay.
eh and then horizontally along 'til about half an inch from the left-hand side of the page.
okey-doke.
okay.
now go vertically up.
have you got white mountain marked.
i do.
you do okay.
go up to the left-hand side of white mountain.
do you want me to come in the page at all.
yes.
just a wee bit so that you are not far from white mountain when you go past it.
then go up beyond white mountain.
on its left-hand side.
eh yeah it's on its left-hand side.
'til you're about eh two and a half inches from the top of the page and just about above white mountain.
right.
ehm have you got a lemon grove marked.
no.
right.
two and a half inches from the top of the page.
yeah roughly.
and above white mountain.
ehm.
have you got a pyramid marked.
uh-huh.
right okay.
well go horizontally along and over the top of the pyramid and down the s-- other side of the pyramid.
have you got cobbled street marked.
no.
no okay.
well go underneath the pyramid.
horizontally.
yes.
that's so so that'll be you moving to your left.
right.
and then to the edge of the pyramid.
okay.
the left-hand edge.
and then go down at a bit of an angle.
which way.
eh.
slightly acute angle.
sorry.
southwest.
yes that way yeah.
okay.
for how long.
for just a wee bit just maybe a couple of inches.
right.
and then go down.
have you got remote village marked.
uh-huh.
right okay.
well you're wanting to go down just to the left of remote village.
okay.
and then underneath remote village.
right that doesn't have to be in a straight line or anything.
eh aye.
fairly horizontal.
and the finish is just southeast of remote village.
oh i do have a poisoned stream marked.
sorry.
well there's two poisoned streams marked.
uh-huh.
yeah.
so the finish is where.
it's just southeast of the remo-- remote village.
southeast of the remote village so it's there.
okay.
okay that's you finished.
right.
do you have crest falls.
crest falls.
mmhmm.
well on the the eastern side of the water bit you.
see where the water is.
yeah.
the water at the bottom of crest falls.
no.
at the top.
right.
see how there's a bit of rock at the sides at the top.
yeah.
the rocks.
well o-- on the eastern side.
right.
mm.
r-- okay.
take the middle of the falls.
right.
and go slightly to the east.
right.
and up about three quarters of an inch.
mmhmm.
that's the start.
that's your start point.
you've got that.
i should have worked that out shouldn't i.
aye.
right.
do you have mm banana something there.
banana tree.
right.
i don't.
right.
come along from the start point to just come straight west to the edge of the falls above the where the edge it would start to come down.
seagulls.
seagulls aye.
just past the seagulls.
right.
now.
come at a an angle of about a hundred and ninety-five degrees.
mmhmm.
come down to.
ehm.
right.
you see the the middle line in the waterfalls.
yeah.
the waterfall line.
see where it finishes.
at the bottom of that line.
right.
uh-huh.
across from that i finished that line there.
got it.
right.
and now.
curve round.
"ehm see where a-- to the bottom of the ""c"" of crest right you know where the ""c"" is."
yeah.
well maybe go two inches to the west of that.
mmhmm.
and put a point there.
got it.
and draw a curve between these two points.
what kind of curve.
ehm.
a curved mainly to the the west so very shallow curve right not straight down then curve round just any point to join them it won't really matter.
is that from the point with the seagulls.
no.
f-- the point from.
halfway down.
so it's going to go up the way.
uh-huh.
it's an upwards curve.
or a downwards curve.
what do you mean.
eh is it curving up towards the footbridge or is it down towards the bottom of the paper.
down.
the curve down.
down.
just a sh-- shallow curve.
uh-huh.
to where i told you the wh-- to mar-- two wh-- inches to the.
yeah.
"west of ""c"" to that point."
right.
just shallow wee curve.
uh-huh right.
a positive gradient.
right.
now.
go straight across from there to about two and a half inches from the edge of the paper.
i'll need to go to about an inch.
what's there.
a banana tree.
i've got a banana tree.
another banana tree.
i've got a banana tree in the bottom left-hand corner of the paper.
so i'd need to come due west.
the extreme bottom.
yeah.
it's right down in the corner.
it's about.
right in the corner yeah.
it's in the bottom portion really.
right.
just now you you'll be about an inch above the bottom.
yeah.
can you go straight across to about at that level from the bottom to about two inches from the the west.
no.
i'd need to go to about an inch.
have you got anything west.
there's nothing on my map there.
how far.
right.
to go up on the east side of the banana trees.
yeah that's.
how far out would you have to be.
well.
just about half an inch of where i am the now to the west.
then i'd need to go up and i've got a footbridge directly above that.
how is the banana tree area really big it's a s--.
yeah.
it's a huge big banana tree it's about one and a half times the size of crest falls.
and it stretches from the below the footbridge.
stretches.
yeah.
ju-- aba-- it's about an inch below the footbridge to about an inch fae the edge of the page fae the bottom of the page then about an inch in and it's about an inch and a half across.
an inch in from where.
an inch in from the left-hand side of the page.
and what do you mean an inch and a half across.
well that's how wide it is the banana tree.
that wide.
aye.
it's about that wide.
that wide or that wide.
that wide.
where are we going to go anyway are we going try to get up the.
thing is right you go along the bottom right and my route about just over an inch from the side of the page.
mmhmm.
goes up again until you're almost on a level with footbridge.
well is that only an inch from the side.
uh-huh.
oh i can do that.
that's what i told you to go over three inches.
oh sorry.
along the bottom.
right.
come along for three inches.
right.
then go up level with footbridge.
no.
now.
you'll be about.
an inch fae the edge and an inch fae the bottom.
well should make it just more than an inch from the maybe about two inches from the edge.
what.
right.
i can't do that it's the banana tree.
right okay.
you'll have to go round them then.
now go up to where.
go slightly curving.
mmhmm.
"ehm until you're at the ""f"" not to the ""f"" but on a level with the ""f""."
how far west of it.
and end up on the same sort of the same vertical.
mmhmm.
as the tree trunk.
axis as.
what tree trunk.
the banana tree trunk.
i don't have the banana tree.
oh you've no got that.
so it's a bit.
right.
make it that you're about three inches above the point you are just now three inches due north.
right.
and curve round your banana trees right if you've got to.
to how far from the edge of the page a couple of inches.
an inch and a half say from there.
right.
right.
got you.
now from that point you'll probably be just over two inches from the footbridge.
aye.
draw a line from there to the the left-hand side of the footbridge.
right.
east due east.
well almost due east you'll be just below the.
yeah.
think i'd on the picture right because you're going to go over the footbridge.
okay.
right.
so i want to go.
so.
just go up to the edge of the footbridge.
right.
so i'm below the footbridge or right at the edge.
right.
see the bridge bit along the top.
where i can go over it.
uh-huh.
where you can go over it.
right.
got you.
right.
don't draw a line over the footbridge.
there isn't one here.
right.
do you have a poisoned stream there.
no.
on the other side of the foot--.
right.
when you come off the footbridge go for about half a centimetre at the very most.
so i'm on the right-hand side of the footbridge and i'm going half a centimetre.
uh-huh.
half a centimetre out.
east.
uh-huh.
right.
and now.
where's the poison stream come from slate mountain.
there isn't a slate mountain on this one.
right.
but it's below slate mountain.
now draw a line due south.
mmhmm.
for about an inch and a half so y--.
you're still above the start point.
yeah.
right eh.
you have an old temple.
yeah.
"now see where the ""m"" of."
yeah.
stream is.
no.
i've no got stream.
oh sorry right.
i'll need be on the mountain somewhere.
okay.
right.
on this level.
right.
"draw a line straight over 'til you're above the ""s"" of start."
"right due east above lef-- ""s"" in start."
right.
"i'm about a half an inch above the ""s""."
so you'll be about.
right.
and from there draw in a curve to the the base.
see the base bit of the old temple.
yeah.
looks as if it's brick or something.
aye.
draw a curve to there.
what the left-hand side.
uh-huh.
just a wee curve going up towards abandoned truck.
there's no aban--.
eh well slate mountain you've no got slate mountain white mountain.
no no not that way.
am i going down towards the bottom right-hand corner or up towards the top left-hand corner with the the curve.
right.
you've come across from the footbridge.
right to the start yeah.
okay.
you're just at start now.
yeah.
now you know where the old temple is.
yeah.
well just draw a wee curve joining those two points.
what kind of curve though.
'cause i mean i'm walking downwards.
well as if.
"an ""n"" curve or a ""u"" curve."
know what i mean.
you'll see right say t-- imagine a clock face.
right.
between three o'clock and six o'clock.
right.
that would be the cur-- that quarter of the clock the way just picture that the way that would go.
between three o'clock.
you're starting off flat and getting steeper.
right.
from six 'til three.
right i've got it.
right.
i'm right at the very side of the old.
temple and right on the side of it.
uh-huh.
right.
now go s-- straight up straight north until about an i-- inch above the top of the temple.
that'll be you near the mountain.
got you.
yeah.
i'm a quarter of the way up the mountain halfway up the mountain nearly.
right.
now.
don't draw a line but say.
go in a s-- an inch and a half.
"how far are you fr-- how far are you from the ""k"" of abandoned truck."
i'm about right i'm on a level with that.
uh-huh.
and i'm about three inches to the right of it.
right.
half take half that distance.
uh-huh.
and go up from there go up just over two inches.
right.
and that'll.
remote village you got a remote village.
not that high up.
not that hi--.
well i'm about an inch below.
well.
"the ""v"" in that."
no maybe take it down another inch then.
all right so about.
"so that'll be me about two inches below the ""v"" in village."
uh-huh.
right.
and about an inch above the top of the truck at the most.
yeah.
uh-huh there.
and i want to draw a line from.
no.
well where you are ju-- put a put a wee point there.
right got one.
now from where you are just now on the line connect those two points.
where i am just now.
to the.
right.
you're just an inch above the old temple.
yeah.
"go to that point two inches below the ""v"" of village."
mmhmm.
straight.
uh-huh.
and now.
"say a s-- three quarters of a centimetre below the ""k"" of truck."
yeah.
now go down to there three quarters of a centimetre uh-huh.
so it's me going round the old mountain.
"directly below the ""k""."
right.
now go how far you'll be about three quarters of a centimetre below the word abandoned truck the words.
yeah.
"go straight across 'til you're under the ""a"" by the same distance."
yeah.
now do you have baboons.
no.
right.
from there go down two inches until you're about an inch from the line you drew to the footpath.
right.
go straight down.
right.
mmhmm.
and now go across until you're about three quarters of an inch from the side of the page if you can do that.
yeah.
right.
in fact to be safe make it half an inch to get round these baboons.
now.
have you got anything between this point and white mountain.
nope.
right.
from here.
ehm.
go up to go straight up to avoid the baboons.
straight up.
how far.
ehm.
"to about the where you started off to make that a ""u"" shape that bit of path."
you know how you've come down and along.
uh-huh.
well i've come down i've went above slate mountain down by the abandoned truck.
uh-huh.
right.
"from the ""a"" of abandoned truck."
aye.
you've went down.
uh-huh.
and then along.
yeah.
"now go back up to about that level to make it a ""u"" shape."
right.
so if there's just a wee totty bit of monkeys or baboons or whatever you call them.
in that space there.
so you want like nine o'clock 'til twelve o'clock.
it's maybe about a couple of inches wide.
make sure you're ehm.
i go north and then across a bit eh.
"make sure you're still at least two inches from the gap that down that ""u"" shape will be at least two inches at all points."
right.
"so just go up to make that a ""u""."
and you're about half an inch from the side of the paper.
yeah.
uh-huh.
"so i want to go where am i ending up beside the ""a"" again."
"well just go straight up until you're on the level of where you star-- at ""a"" below ""a"" three quarters of a centimetre below ""a""."
right.
right.
from there draw a line straight to the bottom left-hand starting point of white mountain maybe just to about half a centimetre to the w-- the left of it.
right that's me.
"level with the ""a"" and then up to the bottom left-hand bit of white mountain."
uh-huh.
how am i far from it.
where.
where th-- about.
centimetre from the bottom.
at th-- not even that.
right.
about half that.
right.
right.
and now.
they'll if you g-- as you go up that side of white mountain there's a wee sort of ledge bit.
you see that where it goes flat.
mm.
i'm in the.
you go up quite steep.
uh-huh.
on the mountain and then it flattens out a wee bit.
yeah.
right at the top about.
no.
below there about a third of the way up.
uh-huh.
there's a wee bit that's almost at a horizontal.
no.
no it'll be a different drawing maybe.
right.
you see about two thirds of the way up the mountain.
uh-huh.
its gradient changes to slightly less steep.
mm a wee bit.
mm a totty totty wee bit aye.
uh-huh slightly.
uh-huh.
well.
go up follow the side of the mountain up to that point still staying about half a centimetre away to a centimetre.
right.
and then have you got anything above that point above white mountain.
i've got lemon grove that's about two inches above it.
do you have a pyramid.
aye.
right.
go.
where is the top of the lemon grove uh in relation to the pyramid.
just on the bottom of it.
right.
now.
go straight up just now until you're about on go due north until you're on a level with about the a third of the way up the pyramid.
you see the black marks up the side of the pyramid.
uh-huh the second one.
until you're level with the second one.
so i'm going to go by the west side of the lemon grove.
uh-huh.
and now would that take you above the lemon grove.
yeah.
now go straight across until you're about an inch from the second black mark of the pyramid.
black mark.
got you.
now.
from there go to a point a centimetre above the peak of the pyramid.
got you.
right.
and then draw a straight line down the other side.
um you see the the bottom right-h-- right-hand corner of the pyramid.
yeah the far away one the one that's.
the one that would be at the front of the pyramid.
yeah.
right the face not the one that would be at the back not the extreme right-hand point.
right.
mmhmm.
about an inch out from there put a dot and join those two points and the.
right.
immediately below that i've got a poisoned scream stream about two centimetres below it.
two centimetres.
the poisoned stream in this one is a bit further below that see i've got two poisoned streams on this map.
mm.
now.
"from there draw a slightly sloping curve again to below the ""d"" of pyramid."
right just slope it round the natural way it would go.
mmhmm.
right.
curve it round.
curve it round with the like that or like that.
to below the d--.
right.
where you are just now remember you do drew the test tube earlier.
is it an arc curve.
uh-huh.
it would be like the bottom half of that test tube.
so it's like that.
uh-huh.
"to below the ""d""."
right.
do you have a cobbled street.
got that's about a s--.
no.
"it's about a centimetre below th-- the ""d""."
right.
from there go carry on straight across until you're below the far left-hand base point of the pyramid.
yeah.
right.
so about an inch yeah.
uh-huh.
now at about a hundred and ninety-five degrees so that's just five degrees more than south.
mmhmm.
to the west side go down about well make it a hundred and.
what did i say there.
hundred and ninety-five you said.
right that's fine.
right.
from there go down.
do you have a remote village.
yeah.
you see the the two dark thick lines that are in that drawing of remote village.
yeah.
go down until straight down at that angle until you're about a centimetre to the side t-- to the west of the line.
so you've got the remote village it's got two hills it's got the remote village is in the middle of two hills with hills behind.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
and you want the the hill on the left-hand side.
uh-huh.
until you're about a centimetre to the w-- west of that.
you're about a centimetre.
right.
so just draw.
dead on the level of it uh-huh.
uh-huh.
right.
got you.
now.
"from there draw another curve until you're below the ""r"" of r-- about a centimetre below the ""r"" of remote."
uh-huh.
right.
"and then go straight across to below the ""e"" of village."
uh-huh.
and then go about an inch further than that on the same level and that's your finishing point.
so that'll be just about below the pyramid the extreme right-hand edge.
uh-huh.
just there.
right.
have you got the missionary camp at the right-hand side.
yeah uh-huh.
okay.
have you got the start.
yeah i've got the start.
is it at the top of it.
uh-huh.
right okay.
go to the right i think it is yeah right go to the right about two centi-- about two three centimetres.
right.
go down two three centimetres.
down.
towards the missionary camp.
uh-huh.
you're at the top and that.
uh-huh.
go right about two go right three centimetres yeah.
uh-huh.
past the missionary camp.
past missionary camp.
go down about two three centimetres.
right.
right.
see your left-hand side have you got gorillas and trees and stuff.
i've got a banana tree.
right well.
go right along to it to the bottom of it right along to the bottom.
right.
so i'll need to go down past the missionary camp won't i.
yeah down past the centre.
right along to the.
right along to the banana tree.
yeah.
to the bottom of it.
yeah the bottom of it.
right.
then go round it to the top just go round it you know right to the end and then just go to the top.
uh-huh.
have you done that.
yeah.
there's a straight river.
uh-huh.
a rope bridge.
uh-huh.
right.
well you're supposed to cross it.
cross the rope bridge.
yeah.
so i need to go along toward.
along ri-- left.
no right.
the rope bi-- ri-- i've come to the bottom of the banana tree.
right.
right.
uh-huh.
then i came up beh-- towards the left of it.
right.
mmhmm.
and now i'll need to go to the right to get to the rope bridge.
right to the rope bridge.
mmhmm.
you have to go r--.
okay right.
just go that way okay.
have you got a waterfall.
a waterf--.
yeah.
that's right towards the other end.
it's on the right-hand side.
uh-huh.
well.
okay cross the bridge right and go to it just go right beside it.
right.
cross the bridge.
uh-huh.
and go to the waterfall.
yeah.
right.
not to it but you know just beside it.
uh-huh yeah.
have you got lost steps.
yeah.
right well go right up to them right to the top of them but not you know to the right-hand side of them not.
the.
to the right-hand side of them.
yeah.
just right to the top to the righthand side.
so i need to curve up and go in a.
uh-huh.
right.
right g-- right.
go over the top.
have you got fallen pillars.
uh i've got right.
see at the top of the map there's a white mountain to the left of that there's rock fall there's a ruined city and gazelles.
oh fallen pillars yeah yeah i've got fallen pillars.
at the bottom.
have you.
uh-huh.
have you got.
well right next well it's sort of the left-hand side to lost steps.
the fallen pillars.
well.
first i've got gazelles and then i've got fallen pillars.
i see.
gazelles are on top of the lost steps.
no.
they're in my map they're ehm to the left in the middle they're in the middle of the map.
the middle of the map.
uh-huh.
well.
never mind them right.
have you got to the lost steps.
yeah i'm at the lost steps just now.
well.
go r-- go over go right around them.
mm.
to the fallen pillars that's to the left.
to the fallen pillars.
mmhmm.
at the bottom of the fallen pillars.
yeah.
right.
sto-- right.
if you go right to the bottom okay.
uh-huh.
ehm go two three centi-- three centimetres down.
down.
mmhmm.
right.
then.
this is so bad.
okay.
are you going down right.
mmhmm.
then sort of go back up in a circle sort of thing you know just curve round to the a--.
curve round curve round the fallen pillars.
have you got.
no not curve round.
you're just at the bottom aren't you.
uh-huh.
and you've gone down a bit.
uh-huh.
then go right to the top not to the fallen pillars to the ancient ancient ruins.
have you got ancient ruins.
i've got a ruined city.
yeah.
well.
just go right right up there up to that.
right.
i'll need to go towards the left yeah.
right uh-huh left.
right.
and go up to the ruined city.
yeah.
whereabouts in the ruined city to the left of it or to the right of it.
the left of it.
left of it right.
have you got stones.
i've got rock fall just above the ruined city to the right.
to the le--.
ah just go up to that.
right.
okay.
to the bottom of the rock fall or the top.
yeah.
the bottom of the rock fall.
right.
then.
turn left.
have you got a white mountain.
yeah.
well.
turn left and go right over around it from the top.
right.
to the bottom of the white mountain.
uh-huh.
go round it to the bottom.
right.
and keep on going eh.
have you got eh soft furnishing store.
soft furnishing store.
yeah.
right to the bottom of the white mountain.
no.
what have you got.
white lost steps.
what.
there's a white mountain at the top of the map.
right.
uh-huh.
to at the right of the white mountain on my map the only thing i've got is lost steps.
no you don't go to that right.
have you gone to the white mountain.
uh-huh.
go right round it.
uh-huh i've gone right round it.
have you gone right round the bottom of it.
i'm at the.
to the bottom of it.
uh-huh.
ah right round the bottom of it.
then go straight down to where.
you know where the gazelles are.
uh-huh.
go right down to the left of them.
right.
okay.
then turn left about th-- three four centimetres.
right.
and that's you finished.
oh.
right.
right.
now the start is above the diamond mine.
right.
now you come down d-- the diamond mine eh down the map from the diamond mine now can you if you can imagine you're you-- y-- you're walking down that line the diamond mine would be on your left.
uh-huh.
right you just pass the diamond mine and then you turn to y--.
the diamond mine on my graph makes me on my right on it on its on my right.
ah.
if i come straight down in a straight line from the start.
mmhmm.
then the diamond mine's on my right.
well it doesnae really matter.
you leave y-- you turn left past the diamond mine so you're going into the map.
right.
and you keep going d-- eh straight across.
mmhmm.
now you should be a graveyard on your left-hand side.
no.
there's no a graveyard.
that doesn't matter.
right.
well do you see a fast flowing river.
fast running creek.
well.
yeah.
go towards the frast fast running creek.
diagonally.
aye well aye.
if there's there should be a graveyard but there's no so.
right.
right.
and then go up to the top of the map and round it.
right.
keeping it on your it would be on your right this time.
uh-huh.
and then circuit it right and come right down the paper.
oh right you're talking about as if i'm walking from the start myself and a wee guy.
aye.
right i get it i get it right.
down the paper.
past canoes.
no.
there's nae canoes.
right okay.
eh now there's an apache camp.
uh-huh.
so there's a a right so there's obviously they're the apaches' canoes.
right.
now y-- ye-- you keep the apache camp to your left-hand side.
right.
and then you turn into the middle of the paper turn right into the middle of the paper.
right.
is there a carved wooden pole.
no.
no.
is there a walled city.
uh-huh.
you wal-- go towards the walled city.
right.
am i above the walled s-- th-- the line i'm drawing should it be.
above the walled city.
right.
well i'll need to move up.
so that the walled city would be on your right again sorry your left.
right sorry okay.
mea culpa that was.
right.
eh hang on a minute right.
we'll start back at the right i'm got i'm at the word apache camp.
right.
mmhmm.
so i have to go along towards the walled city.
aye.
so do i go along and then move up to go round it like that.
you're not supposed to use your hands.
aye you keep the walled city on your you you as the wee man walking along you'd be o-- on your left.
right so i go up and round right.
and circuit it.
and come straight back down the paper.
right.
now.
down by the walled city.
uh-huh.
now you've got to come down a good bit in a kind of.
uh-huh.
a good bit down and then you turn back into the paper so it would be back to your left.
right.
now do i go past anything.
not at that point.
eh in front of you you should see a stone creek.
right that's okay.
now keep that going across the paper keep that on your right-hand side again as the wee man walking down the.
right.
and then is there flat rocks.
above me.
aye.
yeah.
so they're on your left-hand side.
uh-huh.
right.
go between the stone creek and the flat rocks.
right.
and then come to the edge of the paper and turn to your right so you're heading for the bottom of the paper.
you haven't got a saloon bar.
no i don't.
right.
well i'll go along and go up round the saloon bar right and then down towards buffalos.
don't have a pint when you're in.
no right.
right buffalos.
right.
now keep the buffalos to your right-hand side.
uh-huh.
and turn right immediately past them.
right.
now ther-- ther-- there's a cattle ranch.
right.
keep that on your left-hand side.
right.
are you by it.
go by the cattle ranch.
a-- there isn't one on my page.
oh.
well is there a fort.
s-- yes.
it's to my left but quite a bit in front.
well head for it.
and go round it keeping it to your right go between the fort and the bottom of the paper.
right.
right.
and then turn right and you're up at the finish.
by the fort turn right.
right.
how much by it.
just a wee bit.
right.
'cause i've got a v-- carved wooden pole.
the carved wooden pole is to the nor-- the s-- to the right of the finish.
above it.
aye.
right i get it.
so the finish is directly below the start.
almost aye.
right.
right.
right right at the start have you got the start bit.
uh-huh.
right.
go along to your left in a straight line about an inch on the map.
what am i trying to avoid first of all.
stony desert.
that's below the start.
uh-huh.
so i just go s-- left.
go along left.
how far.
about centimetre and a half.
aye.
you past it.
oh right okay right okay.
you past stony desert.
yeah.
right now go down to bottom left t--.
diagonally.
yes.
to miss the to get below the plane crash.
the plane crash at the top right.
right.
where does your route end.
sort of middle above middle right.
what's down there.
oh there's another plane crash down here though.
no there's only one.
right we'll just do that anyway right go down diagonally to the bottom left of the page.
right.
not right to the bottom.
right okay.
and then up in a straight line about.
right.
er about two and a half centimetres.
is there a collaps--.
is there a collapsed shelter.
collapsed shelter.
go up round above that.
uh-huh.
right.
so i start swinging to the right again.
well once you've gone up 'til you're past that on a straight line then go straight line along it and back up above it.
do you know what i mean.
yeah.
okay right.
right.
then down so that you've sort of gone back down the s-- the lef-- right-hand side of it 'til you get to the word collapsed shelter.
right.
so are you past collapsed shelter now.
so.
right yeah.
so right now now there's a waterhole to the right of me.
a savannah.
that's that's to the right of the waterhole.
right well avoid right just move to your right now.
uh-huh.
and so you're directly above the place you started.
right okay that's fine.
about an about a centimetre about two centimetres.
right.
and then straight up about.
about five six centimetres until you get to the.
uh-huh.
above the savannah.
uh-huh.
but not directly above it to the left of it.
right okay.
and then up until you get to the above the peak of the slate mountain which is just on your left.
slate mountain.
uh-huh.
i don't have one.
it's a big slate mountain.
it's called the white mountain.
right well do that anyway until you're about.
so right.
at this point that and the savannah's to the right and then beyond that is p-- the edge of the page.
uh-huh.
right.
so is the big mountain above the savannah for you.
i've got a.
slate mountain right is that part that i said was about.
uh-huh.
that m-- a centimetre and or two above the start.
uh-huh.
go up about five or six centimetres.
straight up.
uh-huh.
right.
and then move to your left.
uh-huh.
about two and a half centimetres.
uh-huh.
and then down diagonally from that about you know s--.
down to the left.
uh-huh.
to miss hot wells.
uh-huh yeah.
you got hot wells.
right so you go round down down below the hot wells and skirt round it at the bottom.
just the hot wells.
so are we.
uh-huh.
'cause you've not got a slate mountain.
just do what i tell you.
okay.
but there's elephants to the left of the hot springs.
shall i go round them as well.
uh-huh.
right.
right now down.
oh no i can't go down.
right.
this is a disaster.
well don't go down then go just go straight up the page past.
okay.
down the to the right-hand side of the ri-- white of the left-hand side of the white mountain.
right that's fine.
quite far up.
uh-huh.
right.
but leave a big bulbous gap after you've got past the hot wells for the elephants is that right.
yeah.
right.
then go straight up and cut in down along quite near the side of the white mountain when you've gone up it.
so do you go atop the will i go round the top of the white mountain.
no.
go right up about three centimetres above it.
uh-huh.
directly above the peak just a wee touch to your left of the peak straight line goes directly above the peak.
oh right.
and then go right.
right.
about that much.
uh-huh.
not diagonally.
right.
and then go round in a sort of round the lake.
have you got a lake up there.
uh-huh.
right well go right up above it and round it and then back round and past.
have you got roman baths.
no.
right well there's roman baths and another plane crash.
ah i see the plane crash.
right.
well the roman baths are above and to the left of that.
uh-huh.
so you've got to miss that as well.
so where do i go what c-- side of the plane crash do i go to.
well see the sort of partial semicircle over the top of the lake.
uh-huh.
just mirror that on the bottom until you're s-- you start m-- until you finish that where you started to do a curve at the top.
see where you started to curve up above the lake.
uh-huh.
right well.
there's round rocks to the left of that.
do you have that.
mm.
do you have round rocks to the la-- left of the lake.
no.
mm.
anyway right once you've got right to the bottom of the lake okay.
uh-huh.
just move along to the left of that.
uh-huh.
so it's sort of bottom left of the lake.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
until you're at bottom left of the lake.
right okay.
do that.
right.
so is it almost a full circle it's like a peninsula.
right.
uh-huh.
that's what i was trying to say.
right.
and then go down in a straight line virtually.
yes.
just come out a wee bit further go along left a wee bit further.
uh-huh.
right and then go straight down.
uh-huh.
to avoid antelopes.
have you got antelopes.
oh yeah.
right.
and then straight along right.
right okay.
until you're directly above the start.
okay right.
and that's your finish.
oh good.
right.
so you've got a a start i presume.
uh-huh yeah.
up at the the top on the sort of left-hand side.
yeah.
just above the diamond mine.
have you got.
yeah.
uh-huh.
so you want to go just round the side of the diamond mine.
right.
so you're at the bottom of that.
right.
right now ehm.
have you got a wagon wheel.
um no.
i've got a swamp.
you've got.
to the left of the bottom left of the diamond mine there's a swamp.
right.
well.
the bottom the bottom left.
well.
you want to just go ehm along to.
you got the stone you s-- you got a stone creek yes.
eh.
stone creek.
no.
you got stone slabs.
i've got like.
you know where the swamp is.
just to the right of that there's rapids.
oh right.
mm.
i've i've not got any of that i've got.
oh the swamp is that to the left of the diamond mine.
uh-huh to the left of the diamond mine.
sorry right i see.
well.
you want to go to the right of the diamond mine just keep going the same sort of direction you are.
right.
in a slight slight up gradient for about.
right.
ehm eh have you got the swan pond at the bottom.
eh swamp's at the bottom left yeah.
the s-- no the.
and i've to go to the right.
ah you've to go to the right.
no sorry right at the bottom of the map there's a swan pond.
do you see that right at the very bottom.
there's a saloon bar at the bottom of my map.
uh-huh.
to to the right of that have you not got a swan pond no.
no.
well.
just just go eh to your right from the bottom of the diamond mine.
uh-huh.
eh in a slight up gradient 'til you're just sort of past centre of the map.
right.
right.
right okay.
uh-huh ehm.
better make sure you're f-- a f-- a reasonable bit to the right-hand side of the map actually.
'cause there's a wh-- a wagon wheel here you've got to miss.
right.
right now y--.
ehm.
you've got have you got a rift valley in the top right hand corner.
yeah uh-huh uh-huh.
and is that the only obstacle you've got.
in just where i'm going there's a cactus as well.
right well.
you want to go up straight up and then along over the top of the rift valley and then down through the middle of it.
right.
so it's straight up to the rift valley.
uh-huh.
and then down through the middle of it.
down through the middle of it yes.
right.
right.
so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley.
uh-huh.
now.
have you got rocks below that.
yeah.
quite a bit below.
it uh-huh.
uh-huh quite a bit below.
it s-- now.
you want to go down straight down to about halfway to the rocks and then just miss the rocks on the left-hand side.
right.
a sort of miss them by go a diagonal line straight down in a diagonal line.
right okay.
missing the rocks by a couple of centimetres.
right.
right eh you've.
have you got a stone creek.
eh no.
no you've not.
right.
ehm there's like to the left of the rocks there's rapids and then like below the rocks there's an outlaws' hideout.
uh-huh.
well.
straight across from the rocks on the left i've got the stone creek.
so what you want to do is you want to keep going down the same direction you're going.
uh-huh.
and 'til you're about the middle of the paper.
right.
and you stop so you're in sort of in a line with the writing of rocks.
right.
so i need to go down as well yeah.
you need to go down yeah.
right got that.
right.
now you want to go.
i've got white water you've you've got something else apparently.
you want to go up slightly and.
what have what have you got to the left of where we are.
rapids.
you've got rapids.
uh-huh.
ah right i've got white water so it's the same.
yeah.
sort of thing presumably.
yeah.
you want to go up the same sort of gradient to the left as you've been going down.
if you know what i mean.
oh right okay.
so you're above.
you're above the rapids.
the rapids.
uh-huh right.
and then.
c-- and then.
come down the side of them at the side of them.
right okay.
right.
right.
so.
have you got anything in the sort of vicinity round about here any obstacles.
rapids well below the rapids there's a manned fort.
well.
you want to go ehm s-- straight down well curve out slightly from where you are and then curve back in eh straight down to.
have you got the stone creek.
yeah uh-huh.
ehm sort of well ten centimetres above the stone creek in a line with just above the stone slabs that sort of level.
right.
right.
and and above the stone creek you want to go down there in a sort of curved slight curved circle the sort of shape of an eye.
right.
i would say.
down to about where just where the stone creek is yeah.
above above the stone creek directly above the middle of that about where the just above the level of the stone slabs.
have you got the stone slabs yeah right.
right.
yeah uh-huh right right.
right.
you there yeah.
uh-huh yeah.
right.
have you got an outlaws' hideout to your right.
yeah.
that's quite a bit above though.
quite a b-- yeah that's right.
uh-huh.
you want to go eh up up to that so you're just underneath the outlaws' hideout.
right.
right.
now right.
you're direct underneath the ou-- outlaws' hideout.
you want to curve out to your right slightly so you're about two or three centimetres well five centimetres off the edge of the page.
right.
and then just go straight down.
have you got the noose.
yeah uh-huh.
uh-huh.
go go just go straight down from there so you're eh at the bottom of the noose on the right-hand side of it.
right.
just a straight line down.
right.
right now you want to curve down.
have you got the swan pond.
no.
you've not got the swan pond.
there's just a noose and then like to the left there's stone creek and below that there's a saloon bar but nothing else.
aye right the saloon bar right.
well.
basically from the noose you're wanting to get to underneath the saloon bar.
uh-huh.
what you've got to do is y-- ehm drop from the the noose in a sort of curve to your left.
right.
so that you're just about the level at the top of the saloon bar.
right.
right.
right now.
just go along a a couple of centimetres not too much.
right.
and and curve curve up and then back down so you're ah.
you've not got the swan pond of course see i've got a swan pond there you need to go up over and round.
mmhmm.
so you want to be going up.
up the way slightly and then back down.
right.
so so should i be sh-- ehm to the left of the saloon bar yeah when i finish.
i'm.
ehm y-- yes.
you go underneath the saloon bar and finish to the to the left of it yeah so from from here you want to go up in a curve and then back down so you're at the same level you were originally avoiding the swan pond that i've got.
right.
right.
okay.
right.
from there you just want to go g-- eh curves you're underneath the saloon bar.
right.
and from underneath the saloon bar.
ehm.
well the finish is.
ehm i was going to say where where the says finish but of course that's not particularly useful.
ehm a couple of i'd say five centimetres above the saloon bar and just off a few centimetres off the side of the map on the left-hand side that's where the finish is.
oh right ehm.
i've come down to the left of the saloon bar and i'm like at the bottom of the saloon bar just now.
y-- right.
you're bottom of the saloon bar.
uh-huh.
right.
you just want to curve up eh along past the saloon bar.
right.
and.
ehm.
it's it's about eh it's just a few centimetres out from the left-hand side of the page a few centimetres up from the saloon bar it's.
oh right.
no i'm going towards the right just now.
oh you're going towards the right sorry.
uh-huh.
right.
you just want you want to be you're at the bottom of the saloon bar.
uh-huh.
and you want to just head up head up to your left basically in in a diagonal past the saloon bar.
oh right.
right okay.
hang on.
right.
right.
and you should be sort of just a few centimetres from the side of the left-hand side of the page.
right.
is that right.
yeah uh-huh.
well.
that's it.
do you know where it is you've to take me then on the map.
uh-huh.
i've got a route i've got a dotted line.
oh right.
but it's i don't see how it works if you haven't got for example got any pelicans.
right.
eh can you be sure that does it say can you be sure they are pelicans.
it says pelicans underneath them.
amongst other indications like the big saggy bit under the beak and stuff.
you know what i mean.
if you haven't got the same stuff and i'd go for a big.
yeah i think we're all right okay uh-huh.
right.
the start is above the summit of the extinct volcano in the bottom right-hand corner of the page.
have you got one of them.
uh i have got that.
it says start.
right.
it says start.
uh-huh hmm.
well you take the dotted line down to the left until it's below the volcano and you go along to the left under the tribal settlement.
right.
i haven't got a tribal settlement.
aha.
right.
so i just i go sh-- sh-- straight down.
so i 'pose you just.
you go sort of off the top of the volcano sort of thing.
above the volcano and then down past it on the left.
right.
right.
and then sort of down along the page straight along the bottom of the page.
straight along about the same level as the volcano.
a bit below it a bit below it.
and then there's a there's a on mine there's a tribal settlement.
right.
right i haven't got one of them.
in the bottom left-hand corner of the page.
so you go round that.
i know.
but i don't have one of them.
aye.
well imagine it's there.
mm-mm right.
have you got a rope bridge.
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh.
right.
after you've gone round the tribal settlement you go up and then you cross the rope bridge from left to right.
i've got a.
right.
okay.
once you get to the other side of the rope bridge you go down about an inch and then you go straight along again towards the right and up.
wait a minute down about an inch.
okay.
right.
round the machete.
well i suppose so aye.
i haven't got a machete.
oh you haven't got one.
but i suppose it would probably be a good idea to go round it.
right.
anyway you go down about an inch and along.
mmhmm to the right right.
to the right until you come just to the left of the collapsed shelter and go straight up past it to the left of it.
if you've got a collapsed shelter.
uh-huh i've got one.
right so i'm going up that.
right.
uh-huh.
right so then.
you go up to about the middle of the page the whole page.
right.
right.
above the crevasse.
have you got a crevasse.
uh-huh that's must be why you go all the way up there.
mmhmm.
and i suppose you go over the top of the crevasse and down between that and the saxon barn.
have you got a saxon barn.
uh-huh.
so i k-- i go over the top of the crevasse.
well.
well i haven't got one.
but i suppose you do.
mm i i sort of jump.
uh-huh.
right.
that's you know what i mean it goes up to the middle of the page to above th-- the level of the saxon barn and then it goes across towards the left over the crevasse presumably and down between that and the saxon barn and then along under the saxon barn do you see what i mean.
mmhmm.
uh-huh.
and once you get to the other side of the saxon barn underneath it you go down about an inch to avoid the pelicans.
oh right.
which i haven't got right.
right.
uh-huh.
go down about an inch and along about an inch and then back up again to the left of the pelicans if you see what i mean.
right.
right.
mmhmm.
have you got a white mountain.
mmhmm.
right.
well after the invisible pelicans you go up the page and eh in slightly s-- and then past to the past the white mountain to the left of it.
behind the white mountain or or to the s-- which side of the white mountain.
to the left of it.
you sort of go.
go i'm going like round behind it.
why behind wh--.
or in front of it.
what do you mean behind it or in front of it.
you don't go through it you just go past it.
right.
so this side of it then.
uh-huh.
like to the left of it.
right.
you like go go past it sort of do an outline of it to the left of it don't touch it.
oh right.
right round the top.
what do you mean round the top.
right.
see where it's written white mountain.
mmhmm.
do i go between that and the actual drawing of the mountain or do i go round the top of the mountain.
your mountain must be different from mine.
just go up the side of the page straight past the whole lot.
right.
right okay.
right.
right.
so have you gone past the top of the mountain to the left of it.
uh-huh.
have you got a golden beach in the top left-hand corner of the page.
no.
well i have you don't actually go to it.
you just sort of once you get past the top of the mountain go straight up but ehm leave like a couple of inches on the left and a couple of inches from the top of the page.
right.
right.
and make that point a corner so that you turn to the right.
right.
and eh go along another couple inches.
have you got a slate mountain.
uh-huh.
well go up the si-- up the left-hand side of it round the top and down the right-hand side of it and round the word slate mountain just sort of do a circle round it.
right.
so i'm going right round.
uh-huh.
until you come sort of to sort of underneath it underneath the words slate mountain.
mmhmm.
and then ehm.
sort of drop down again down the middle of the page a couple of inches.
i can't do that.
why not.
'cause i've got some submerged rocks.
aye well.
have you got them.
is that underneath the slate mountain.
mmhmm.
well go between them and the slate mountain until you get to the other side of the submerged rocks i suppose they must be under it.
right.
and i've got a secret valley.
have you got that.
uh-huh.
so presumably are the the submerged rocks above the secret valley.
uh-huh.
right well.
go down past to the left s-- hand side of the submerged rocks.
mmhmm.
and then past the left-hand side of the secret valley.
right.
and then along the bottom of the secret valley.
and that's the finish.
oh right.
i've got.
you haven't got the other golden beach.
uh-huh uh-huh.
but we don't get that far.
we don't need it and that's it right.
that seems to be it yeah.
okay then.
there you go.
okey-dokey right so.
your start's away up in the top.
you got you got a wee cross.
uh-huh.
right.
have you got the diamond mine.
yes i have.
well.
"if you dis-- come down down the west side of that and hang a left right underneath it right underneath the ""d"" of the diamond."
right.
to what point will i draw a l--.
eh go along.
you've not got the graveyard sure you've not.
no.
right.
tell you what right there's a graveyard about an inch and a half to the east of the diamond mine.
and you go along under the diamond mine and underneath the graveyard.
have you got the ravine.
no.
have you got carved stones.
yes.
well.
the ravine's just an inch below the carved stones.
rightee-ho.
so.
if you go along 'til about a centimetre before you get to your ravine.
aha right.
then head north to the we-- past you pass the west side of the carved stones.
over the top of the carved stones.
yes.
right.
right.
and have you got the indian country.
mmhmm.
so you come down the other side of the carved stones down and when you get to the top of the indian country just.
you've not got the great rock eh.
yeah just go down to the top of the indian country first.
now.
to the left sorry to the west of the indian country there's a great rock.
no not on this one.
right.
well.
on this one there's a great rock.
so.
right.
if you go down a what does it say a f-- about a forty-five degree angle direct from directly above the big teepee.
mmhmm.
or wigwam.
so i'll draw a line straight across to above that.
yeah.
when you get to above the big teepee then it'll be go down about an inch inch and a half at a forty-five degree angle from that.
right.
then you go along over th-- over to the top of the gold mine.
right.
that's below the diamond mine.
yeah they're yeah directly below uh-huh.
a good bit below it.
uh-huh.
yeah.
so you.
what side of the top to right in the middle.
eh the west side.
right.
right.
near the gallows.
yeah.
you're about forty-five degree bearing away from that.
oh right okay.
and you go down south until you're about two thirds of the way down towards the great rock.
where the totem pole the bottom of the where the totem pole would be.
yeah.
right.
and then you go.
have you got the trout farm.
uh-huh.
it's away over below the indian country.
yeah.
well.
you go al--.
right.
you're you're at your totem pole on your map i think it is.
uh-huh.
at the bottom i'm below the trout farm.
yeah right well.
if you go along underneath your totem pole for about an inch it may aye may be just over an inch.
until the other side of the totem pole.
mmhmm.
"then head up towards the trout farm with your line coming down there g-- going up to the ""t"" the first ""t""."
then have you've not got the fort sure you haven't the cavalry.
no.
no.
well.
if you go along after the trout farm if you.
right.
"i'll go up to how far from the ""t""."
right bel-- right underneath it.
right.
now.
i'd say if you go along east about two inches.
then.
right so.
i'm just past the far edge of the trout farm.
eh if you move it higher up give it a wee bit further than that.
right okay.
then.
you've got the cattle stockade.
uh-huh.
away down the bottom.
yeah well.
"if you go straight down passing that on the east side just right until you come to the ""e""."
right.
then.
"go westerly under it until you come to the ""c"" the f-- ""c"" in cattle."
"oh the ""c"" of cattle."
yeah.
right.
i'd presume that you've got something between the bandit territory and the cattle stockade.
yes.
a parched river bed.
judging b--.
yeah.
well.
if you do-- drive over the top of that just over the top of it and then come down the other side underneath the bandit territory.
then.
have you got the wee cross for your finish.
no.
no.
well.
about an inch to the left of the wee tree an inch and a half to the left of the wee tree that the bandit's lying up against.
mmhmm.
your wee f-- your finish sign's there.
eh if you go under your bandit territory and up to it.
right.
"i'm under the ""b"" of bandit just now."
you just go straight up to your wee cross.
about how far up about an uh an inch.
it's about prr an inch inch or so.
right.
there we go and that's us one map complete.
that's it.
right.
you got a map with an extinct volcano.
right yes i have.
i'm just in front of that.
right.
with the start.
right.
you've got a cross marked start.
yes.
right.
if you just want to come like down past the extinct volcano down to like to towards the bottom of the page.
right okay.
just straight down directly south.
uh-huh just straight down.
uh south.
how far.
south down to about equal to where the tribal settlement is further on.
equal to where the tribal settlement is.
just a wee bit below it because you're going to go start going ehm west you.
right.
i've no g-- i've not got any tribal settlement at all and other than that i've got an extinct volcano and that's heading down towards.
y-- you've not got a t--.
you've not got.
the bottom of the page.
you've not got to the left-hand side a tribal settlement.
no i haven't.
well you're going to go down about three centimetres down to where it the word says extinct volcano.
right okay.
okay.
then you're going to start going along west.
west right okay for.
right.
keep on going until you're maybe about three centimetres from the the left-hand side of the page.
from the left-hand s--.
that's quite a bit.
uh-huh it's quite far along.
'kay.
so just about three in-- three centimetres from the left-hand side.
right okay.
okay.
then you're going to start going up north.
right okay.
right.
have you got a rope bridge.
i have just up to sort of.
uh-huh.
so if you start just drawing drawing a line up towards the rope bridge.
up towards going diagonally across to the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
just going up then veering off to the right up to the rope bridge.
'kay.
then you're going to go across the rope bridge.
right okay.
so i draw a line through the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
you're going to go through that.
okay.
right.
the end of the rope bridge.
you're at the end of the rope bridge.
now if you go down not very steeply but just ehm down south a bit.
down right.
about about another three centimetres just a gradual slope down.
gradual sort of south through east.
uh-huh.
uh-huh slope to the east.
aye south to east slope down about three centimetres.
okay.
right.
so now you want to go east.
right okay.
straight across.
just a straight line east.
just a straight line.
for about.
how far.
have you got a collapsed shelter.
yes i have that's a--.
right.
you're going to go along until you're underneath the collapsed shelter.
right i'll be underneath it by about two or three centimetres.
but.
"uh-huh just a little below the ""o"" actually."
right okay.
okay.
then you're going to start going up north again.
okay.
"and put your line through the ""o""."
okay.
and you're going to go up there for about about ehm let me see about ten centimetres up.
okay.
past the crevasse on the right on the left.
have you not got a crevasse.
i've not got a crevasse.
no okay.
for about ten centimetres.
uh-huh ten centimetres straight up north.
right.
and then you're going to actually you're not just going to go ehm when you go st-- you're going to go back west again but if you actually kind of go up a wee bit then diagonally down know what i mean like in a wee hump.
right.
oh right i see what you mean.
okay.
uh-huh.
you know if you go up and then come back down.
and have you got a saxon barn.
okay yes.
right.
well you're just going to go up and come down underneath the words saxon barn.
so do a sort of semicircle to the saxon barn.
uh-huh yeah that'd be.
"so you've just drawn your line just under the ""s"" of the saxon bar."
okay.
"just under the ""s""."
uh-huh.
and have you got pelicans.
i haven't no i've not.
right.
so you're going to go down ehm south.
right.
for about this is ehm not a not a dia-- uh-huh a diagonal line i would say right down about another three c-- three four centimetres.
diagonal line which way.
sorry ehm to the.
s-- east west.
to the west.
left right.
to the west.
to the west.
so carry on the same direction as the hump is that.
uh-huh.
right.
right.
you're down about west eh r-- sorry down about north west about oh sorry god what am i saying south.
southwest.
southwest about three centimetres.
right okay.
and you've not got pelicans you said.
no i've not.
right.
and then continue going west it's just straight across.
right.
is this this so this is towards the edge of the edge of the paper.
for about three centimetres so you're kind of l--.
uh-huh this is towards the edge of the paper.
okay.
so you're making another little kind of you're making a wee pit and now you're going to go back up again.
okay.
you're going to go up north well this is quite a long way this time about about twelve centimetres right up north up the side of the page.
just.
okay.
and have you got a white mountain.
so are we about a third down the page at the moment.
aye we're about a third down the page.
right.
and you're going to go up to about two thirds up the page with this line.
right okay.
the top of the white i've got a white mountain yes.
oh you've got the white mountain.
i have got the white one.
well you see how like the white mountain's jagged on the left-hand side.
yes.
like if you just kind of like veer your line as though you're going up the moun-- the white mountain.
up up the side of it right.
uh-huh up the side of the white mountain.
okay and when i get to.
and right once you reach the top of the white mountain.
yes.
with your line just continue straight up north.
have you got a golden beach.
golden beach.
i've not no.
well the golden beach is about six centimetres up so if you.
so is this directly just a straight line.
this is direct--.
this is directly up north.
a straight line up to the golden beach.
right.
from the top of the white mountain.
from the top of the white mountain right up.
how f-- how far up.
ehm about six centimetres 'til you're about ah 'til you're about ehm about the same distance away from you're about five centimetres six centimetres from the top of the page now.
right okay.
okay.
right.
to the left-hand side of the page.
yes.
right.
and now we're going to go a complete straight line ehm east.
right.
for about six centimetres again 'cause if you.
right have you got a slate mountain.
ah th--.
right 'til it's just the bottom of slate mountain that'll be then.
okay.
okay.
and see how you what you did with the white mountain ehm.
what i did with the white mountain.
you you just went up the side.
yes.
go up the side of it.
well look as though you're going to climb the up to the top of the slate mountain.
okay.
then come back down the other side missing the wee seagulls.
right so that right that's what i'm doing oh right oh okay.
right down the side missing the seagulls.
wait wait.
down the side just missing the seagulls right.
that's it i've just killed one of them.
right you're bottom.
right you're bottom of the slate mountain now.
right okay.
right.
right have you got a secret valley.
eh yes i have.
that's that's down below the slate mountain yes.
uh-huh.
about ten centimetres twelve centimetres.
right w--.
right.
what you're going to do is like you're at the bottom of slate mountain and you're going to g-- actually go ehm you're going to go west like underneath the slate mountain.
right.
okay.
right.
going a wee bit diagonally not a completely straight line.
do you know what i mean.
right.
okay.
uh-huh.
you're going to come as though you're just going up the top you're coming back the way you've come.
right okay.
sort of eight o'clockish.
uh-huh yeah.
round to the left-hand side of the page again.
right okay.
that'd be west.
and then once you reach about the as though the the bottom of the slate mountain again you're going to go competely down to the bottom of the secret valley.
right.
right okay.
dir-- just directly down.
just directly down.
straight down.
to the secret valley.
uh-huh just to the bottom of the where it says secret valley.
okay.
and then can you see you just draw a straight line to the finish.
to the finish no.
i've not got a finish.
well the finish is actually.
you know where it says secret valley.
it's just about a centimetre along from that and down a wee bit that's where the f--.
right.
"from the edge of the letter ""y""."
uh-huh.
"it's about a centimetre along from the letter ""y"" and about a centimetre down that's your finishing cross."
centim--.
right okay.
and that's the end.
that's the end.
right right.
right.
have you got the start above the haystack.
yeah.
right.
if you want to sort of ehm head down towards the haystack right pass it by on its left-hand side.
yeah 'kay.
right.
and head more or less straight down maybe curving slightly towards your left.
have you got a blacksmith marked.
no i don't.
no.
ehm head down for about eh two inches from the haystack two and a half inches.
two inches okay.
right.
ehm go to your right towards the carpenter's house.
all right.
well i'll need to go below got a blacksmith marked.
right well you do that.
do you want it to go below the carpenter.
no.
i want you to go up the left-hand side of it towards green bay and make it a slightly diagonal line towards ehm sloping to the right.
okay.
so you want me to go above the carpenter.
uh-huh.
right.
towards the bay.
the bay.
have you got the bay no.
what crane bay.
green bay.
no i don't have a crane bay.
right.
okay well head up above the carpenter's house for about ehm it should be about an inch above it.
alright.
okay.
and head slope slightly down the way for about two inches.
right.
do you have the seven beeches.
well okay.
nope oh yes i do sorry.
you do.
right.
go down past them on their left-hand side.
okay.
and stop when you get to where it says seven beeches.
okay.
now you're going to go underneath that bit you're going to make a slight curve ehm to the right right while it's still going down the way.
right.
because you're avoiding a chapel which i don't think you've got.
no.
so i'm going right.
uh-huh you're going right.
make it a curve sort of.
down the way.
down the way uh-huh.
out towards the the right-hand side of your paper.
okay.
how far out towards right-hand side.
right.
not too far just like you were drawing a circle but not quite.
okay.
right.
ehm now you're slightly less than an inch below the chapel.
you haven't got the chapel ha ha ha.
no.
you're about two and a half inches below the seven beeches.
turn to the right of them.
right.
you're above the.
ehm not really you're underneath them.
oh oh no i'm not.
well you should be.
right.
you should be just above the reclaimed fields.
right okay.
i can go down there.
right.
ehm.
and i want you to come above them and round to the right-hand side of them and underneath them.
right.
right dri--.
down to the right-hand side.
round the right-hand side and come right along underneath them.
oh right.
okay.
right and stop when you get to the line where they stop.
right okay.
and i'd like you to come straight down the way towards crane bay.
okay.
and when you get to that curve of crane bay stick closely to it.
okay.
for until you get to that corner.
which corner.
"you see where the just opposite the ""c"" of crane bay diagonally opposite."
towards the north of it or to the.
uh-huh.
right.
right.
now you're heading towards vast meadow and attractive cliffs.
well yes okay.
right.
now i don't want you to stick to the coast just opposite vast meadow.
right you've got to come down in between vast meadow and the attractive cliffs.
okay.
in a straight line between them once you've come down ehm at a southwesterly angle towards them and then in straight in between them.
right.
right.
so i'm down near the attractive cliffs.
uh-huh you're in between vast meadow.
and attractive cliffs.
okay.
and then you come down in a southwesterly angle again down the left-hand side of the attractive cliffs.
okay.
stop when you get to the bottom of them.
okay.
have you got crashed spaceship marked.
no.
oh right.
ehm i'd like you to head more or less westwards curving slightly down the way towards the left-hand side of the page very very close to the edge.
well i'm quite close to the edge.
i mean how far down do you want me to go.
i want you to oh you're heading towards the chestnut tree but you're not ehm going diagonally towards it.
right.
just come down the side of the page for about an inch and a half.
okay.
then head towards chestnut tree.
uh-huh.
towards the finish.
okay.
where's the finish.
at the chestnut tree.
right.
north of it.
no.
just by the side of it at the the left-hand side of it.
left-hand side okay.
that's you i hope.
right lynn you're at the start.
right.
up at the top left-hand page.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
and you've got a burnt forest beside you just below it.
right.
what my map says is it's actually a curved line but i don't know whether to give you a curved line or a straight line i'll give you a curved line right.
mmhmm.
have you got anything like to the r-- to the left of the burnt forest.
i've got a burnt forest and then straight below it i've got a carpenter's cottage then a ravine that's all i've got.
well i haven't got the carpenter's cottage.
is that directly beside the ravine.
it's.
uh-huh it's directly.
well a wee bit up but i-- near enough.
a wee bit up.
have you got the remote village.
n-- up at up at this side.
beside the burnt forest.
no.
no well what i suggest you do lllll ehm is like right there's a there's a line about quarter of the way down and it's the bottom of it it's from the start right and the bottom of it is in parallel with the ravine.
right okay.
you know the word.
uh-huh.
ravine.
have you got that.
i've got ravine.
right.
so it's like.
so i start from start an--.
uh-huh.
and it's like a curve.
will i go underneath the burnt forest.
no no you don't.
no sorry.
right.
it's just like a r-- a kind of slight curve.
right.
uh-huh and it's just to parallel with the ravine the word ravine.
okay.
aye wait a minute.
which way am i going.
right i'm at the start.
sorry yeah.
it's a.
you know what i mean i'm.
it's a curve to the right.
a curve to the right.
you've.
uh-huh.
not got the burnt forest you have got ah no you haven't.
no.
i have got the burnt forest.
and it's not through it it's like.
so i'm going a curve and it goes down to the ravine.
uh-huh.
no not to the ravine parallel with it.
right.
jus--.
bu-- right the bottom of the curve is like parallel with the word start.
do you know what i mean.
it's just a curve.
know what a curve is.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
right and i'm going towards down towards the ravine.
well the bottom of it.
sorry i can't.
right.
right.
just draw a straight line.
oh right oh god a straight line.
okay just draw a straight line.
oh but it's kind of curvy.
that'll be easy uh-huh.
but i'm still up at i'm still up at the top of page.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
right i get what you mean now.
at the top of the burnt.
right okay right.
mmhmm.
and you s-- finish your curve at where's the start you know parallel ehm just parallel no no no no f-- just down from start.
right okay okay i've got it i've got it i've got it.
okay an--.
and it's like parallel to the ravine the bottom of it is like well not parallel but on the same line as the ravine.
ah right.
"on the straight line i've go-- it's kind of like as though it's just dubbed directly above the ""a""."
what.
sorry on you go.
right i've drawn this line.
right.
is it is it stopping just down from start in a straight line from start.
uh-huh.
well it's kind of curvy.
uh-huh good good.
curvy to the right.
i'm all right curvy to the right.
right.
and then you go across and stop.
this is a-- by the way this is about like five centimetres down from the top of the page this about right.
aye.
yeah.
aye right okay.
it should stop at v-- you know doing the just in a straight line from the ravine.
right.
right i've got it.
in a straight line to like a straight line across like.
towards the pine grove.
you got a pine grove.
no uh-huh yeah yeah.
no not across to there.
"vertical right a vertical line this is quite good vertical line and stop just where the ""r"" is in forest down from forest."
do you know what i mean.
oh wait a minute a vertical line.
mmhmm.
you mean i'm going down towards the ravine i'll be in the ravine.
oh no no.
a horizontal line.
right a vertical a.
horizontal line mmhmm.
towards the right.
and where do i stop.
"just down from where the ""r"" is."
okay.
from pine grove.
mmhmm.
right okay.
right.
and then and then.
oh i'm not allowed to move.
right.
go up again ehm you know how you got the ravine just go up and past the ravine.
have you got the remote village no.
i'm a-- i'm really past the ravine by now.
i'm at the pine grove i'm at at towards the right-hand side of the page.
well go back don't pass the pi-- don't pass the ravine.
"oh the ""r"" of the ravine."
pardon.
"i thought you meant the ""r"" of the pine grove."
no.
right wait a minu--.
don't pass the ravine okay.
"it's the ""r"" of the burnt forest i was talking about."
oh so you this line was only about two centimetres long.
uh-huh yeah.
right.
right.
i'm not past the ravine.
right okay.
and go up.
up.
up now.
up towards the top of the page.
no.
up towards just right up to the top of the ravine past the birds.
you mean down to the ravine.
no.
up right up to the top of the ravine.
i'm above the ravine.
right.
you're kidding.
right okay wait a minute right.
i came from the burnt forest.
mmhmm.
and i came and i did a d-- a kind of a curvy right just to like towards like.
you see where it says burnt forest.
mmhmm.
just about parallel where it says burnt forest so i'm up there.
do you know where i am.
right.
about five centimetres from the top of the page.
do you want to start again.
right.
right start okay.
right.
vertical line down to the r-- ravine.
oh just vertically down.
uh-huh vertically down.
okay.
right.
but missing out anything that might be in between.
down towards.
right.
okay.
can you do this.
aye.
i think you can.
right.
right vertically down 'til you're like in a straight.
okay.
right.
i'm at diag--.
right i know what you mean now.
right i'm at the ravine.
"and then i go along to where it says ""r"" of the ravine."
no.
"you go along to where it says ""r"" of the burnt forest."
oh right.
a horizontal line.
okay.
right okay.
"just in line with the ""r"" of the burnt forest."
oh right i've got you now right i've got that.
and then you go up a vertical line.
to the top of the ravine.
uh-huh.
right okay.
and i've got the carpenter's cottage.
so i have to miss that.
yeah you'll have to miss that.
so see the wee seagulls at the ravine.
uh-huh.
just about up there.
above that yeah.
oh i've got you now right.
and then a horizontal line.
uh-huh.
under the remote village.
have you got that.
i've not got the remote village is it.
well don't go very far just go a little bit above the seagulls in the ravine.
uh-huh.
okay.
right.
and then draw a horizontal line.
just to about the end of the ravine.
uh-huh.
right.
well a wee bit further.
right.
okay.
have to just towards halfway between the pine grove no.
you got the pine grove.
no i ha-- oh yeah i have yeah.
right uh-huh across to there.
oh as far as that.
uh-huh.
it doesn't matter i'm just going to tell you to draw straight lines.
okay.
okay.
and like you go right go in a vertical line down just until you you're underneath the pine grove.
right okay.
okay.
uh-huh.
and then.
ehm.
oh i can't get you.
have you got anything.
i've got an avalanche.
i haven't got that.
where's that.
right see the pine grove.
it's just below it to your right.
uh-huh.
below it right.
tell you what miss out.
have you got i don't think you'll have the concealed hideout.
i do.
have you oh you do.
uh-huh.
oh well right just draw a line right draw a line until.
what you've got to do is.
i would suppose that your avalanche is ehm miss-- right your avalanche is like outwith the line.
do you know what i mean.
uh-huh yeah it is.
so like the line is within well m-- in my map i think the line is within the avalanche.
the avalanche is quite far to the right.
okay right.
what you do is w-- wh-- in my picture i've got two och how could you say bumps right i would say the avalanche is missed out it's drawn to miss out the avalanche.
uh-huh.
but includes within this line it includes the concealed hideout.
right.
so could you draw something that would.
do you want me to go down towards the concealed hideout.
uh-huh.
missing out the avalanche.
uh-huh.
and goi-- and go round the concealed hideout concealed hideout.
to your right.
uh-huh.
go round it and include it in the line.
right i'm just drawing my line underneath the word concealed hideout now.
oh good right.
you d-- have you done that yeah d-- drawn it underneath.
uh-huh.
i've drawn my line.
"and it's just i'm just at the down below the ""t"" of concealed hideout."
oh right okay.
well draw a a horizontal line over.
have you got the boat house.
uh-huh.
over to the boat house.
right.
you mean vertical down to the boat house.
no.
horizontal over to the boat house.
oh right horizontal over to the boat house right.
okay i'm directly above the boat house now.
you're above it.
mmhmm.
my my boat house is down below crane bay.
i haven't got that.
you're above the boat house though.
i've got a boat house there's crane bay and i've got a boat house just.
do--.
okay right.
oh i've got two boat houses.
alright.
do you do you see do you see where my boat house is.
ehm uh-huh.
right well go back up again to the concealed hideout.
i'm at the concealed hideout.
and you're you've drawn a horizontal line.
i'm just.
see where the boat house is.
uh-huh.
b-- the boat house at crane bay.
i've got two.
well.
mm the one the one further down the page.
uh-huh yeah.
right.
i'm just about my line's just about five centimetres above it.
okay that's good.
right.
draw it over to the other.
have you got another boat house.
i've only got one boat house.
oh right.
well i've got two.
i've got one parallel to the concealed hideout well just about.
oh right.
i've not.
well what you could do is draw a line underneath the concealed hideout until you get.
"right see the ""b"" of crane bay."
uh-huh.
"well until you stop at the ""b""."
oh right.
i've gone along too far then.
uh-huh.
"stop at the ""b""."
right okay.
and then go right down horizontal i mean vertical go right down.
you know how you've got that have you got the crane bay have you got the actual outline of it.
to what.
uh-huh.
well go right down.
until i touch the outline.
no no no no no.
until you're nearly touching it you're maybe just like half a mil-- half a centimetre.
right okay.
right okay.
away from it.
okay.
that's me.
and f-- and follow it.
you know how that wee curve.
uh-huh.
there's a wee curve.
follow that wee curve.
right.
down towards the boat house.
no.
the other way sorry the other way to your left.
off to my left.
uh-huh.
right.
just follow that wee hump.
uh-huh.
right okay.
okay.
and ehm have you got a coconut palm.
no.
no.
oh well what you'll have to do is ehm eh follow that again go over the bump.
have you come to the bump.
i've come to the bump.
right.
follow it again.
uh-huh.
just so far like ehm uh maybe about two centimetres.
mmhmm.
over the bump.
right.
right i've done that.

are you maybe are right tell me where you are just now are you like.
i'm just at the right of the washed stones at the left-hand side of the page.
i've not got washed stones.
so are you two mi-- two about two centimetres above from the bottom of the page just now.
i'm.
aye.
i'm about.
are you if in parallel with the flagship.
uh-huh.
or in the same level.
oh well that's it.
well no.
i could go down but i've got the the flagship there's a wee there's a wee bit of bay sticking out.
uh-huh right.
where are you where have you stopped.
i've stopped about six centimetres up i mean i'm i'm about three or four centimetres up from the flagship.
oh no.
what the line stops at the flagship well not at the flagship about two centimetres away from it.
right.
what do you want me to do do you want me to.
ehm.
do you want do you want me to miss that wee jut out of the bay draw a line round that.
where.
do you know how the flagship.
uh-huh.
there's a wee bit of bay that juts out.
uh-huh.
do you want me to draw a line round that so i'm going to miss it.
where are you oh oh what l-- what side of the pebbled shore are you.
i'm near en-- i'm near enough the right now 'cause i had to miss the washed stones.
what.
you're at the right of it.
mmhmm.
you should be at the left of it.
right okay.
could you go round.
i'll go round the washed stones the other way.
to i don't have the washed stones.
right so.
you want me to be at the left of the pebbled shore.
uh-huh i want you to go round the left of the pebbled shore.
oh i did do that.
oh you did do.
you said the right.
uh-huh.
i know.
but i'm now at the 'cause i've had to miss the washed stones so i'm now near enough the right.
where are your washed stones.
the washed stones are.
see the pebbled shore.
uh-huh.
they're about three centimetres down to the left.
oh right okay.
all right so you jutted them out.
uh-huh.
so i came back round to the right and jutted them out.
oh good.
uh-huh.
so you're now so where are you now right you're about.
right.
see the flagship.
uh-huh.
see the wee bit of bay that's jutting out.
uh-huh.
right.
i'm exactly two centimetres up above that about that wee that that wee tip comes out.
well go down until you're in a v--.
right see the windows of the flagship.
aye.
this stops at the windows.
can i go actually into crane bay.
no.
right.
so i go down.
no.
you're away fr-- right you see the wee bit that's jutting out.
uh-huh.
just across from the windows.
uh-huh.
you're about a centimetre and a half away from that.
okay.
right.
that's where i am just now.
right.
that's the finish.
oh right.
so i don't actually touch the flagship.
no.
right.
so i just cr-- put a cross and finish.
uh-huh.
so it's about a centimetre up from that wee jutty-out bit that's the finish.
no.
are you at the windows are you finished just in a v-- horizontal line from the windows of the flagship.
ah it's have i got to go horizontally.
uh-huh.
oh it's it's it's in a wee recess bit.
sorry.
see the how you've got the jutty-out bit then it goes in and out.
uh-huh.
is that where the finish is.
uh-huh.
right.
so i c-- i.
but it's not actually in crane bay.
aye i know where you are.
okay.
so i do that and then do a cross and finish.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
right okay i know where you are now.
okay.
and am i directly above the windows.
just in f-- horizontal to it.
right.
okay.
ready dave.
yeah.
fire away.
right.
starting above the site of the forest fire.
certainly am.
right.
go east west sorry go west slightly just past it and down and then you go south.
and go hang a big left right past it.
right.
so you go so you're going east west then south down.
yep.
have you got a picnic site.
nope.
where is it.
right okay.
it's about an inch is it below the s-- site of the forest fire and about an inch above the an inch and a half above the bottom of the the page.
an inch.
so you go south and then you go round the bottom of it so you go south and then east.
so i'm go--.
right.
f-- and you go east about from the side of the page going about th-- three inch.
have you got an adventure playground.
mmhmm.
which is just to the it's to the right and below the site of the forest fire.
right.
you go past the picnic site so you're about th--.
and it's above you go north so you're o-- going on the left-hand side of the adventure playground.
mm.
what have you done dave have you d--.
so i'm going between the picnic site and the adventure playground.
yeah.
okey-dokey here we go.
so.
your line so far's gone in a wee sort of.
"well it's like a ""q"" with a wee extra bit i've added on."
you're now you're above the just go up just above the adventure playground.
mmhmm.
and start going right across the page to the east ehm at a five degree angle can you do that just a wee angle.
how far.
a five degree angle.
just a wee angle it's just.
so i'm going up like that then.
you are.
you mean five degree fae a horizontal right.
aye.
right along to the end of the page.
across to.
no.
get at least two thirds of the way across the page dave.
right got you.
got a granite quarry.
nope.
above.
got privately owned fields.
no have you got a granite quarry somewhere on the page about in the mi-- mid centre.
yes.
just above centre.
mmhmm.
right.
you should your line should've gone t-- across and just past it.
mmhmm.
so that you when you go north you start going north you you come up on the right-hand side of it and you curve round over the top of it so in a sort of you've got to go up and round.
fish hook.
waterfall have you got a waterfall.
mmhmm.
right.
you go your curve comes round the granite quarry and down on the other side t-- and then it straightens out and it goes about about an inch below the word waterfall.
mmhmm.
t-- and you go just past the waterfall you curve round and go start going north again up past the waterfall to get to the top of the waterfall you go right i mean you go east just past the side of the waterfall.
mmhmm.
you go up about two inches so you should be.
have you got cornfields.
mmhmm.
the top you should be like at the right to about two inches below them at the right-hand corner of that.
of the corn field.
the left-hand corner.
just made a right coo's arse out of that one.
right.
okay.
we've got the west highland way on this one no tourist.
shit.
and i hope it's not the way i done it.
aye we're only about a thi-- a quar-- third of the way along it.
this map's got stitches it's excellent.
right.
this is awful.
right.
you're below the cornfields right.
right.
s-- you've got to go down sss-- southeast.
yeah.
to.
have you got fallen cairn down in the s--.
that's southw-- aye that's southeast yes.
way past the lion country.
right.
well i don't have lion country but.
right.
so you'll avoid lion country.
i'll try and miss that i don't fancy being eaten.
if you have to go through it.
right.
s-- southeast from where you are.
right down to fallen cairn.
down down.
so you come down on the left-hand side of it and you go round the bottom of it.
below.
right.
just past and then you go start cutting up.
straight up.
right.
towards the lake.
have you got oh you don't have limestone cliffs do you.
eh you you start going up sort of parallel to the line you just drew round for just a couple of inches.
right.
"then you go ss-- you go north straight up to just below the east lake and you should be up to about about the ""k"" below the k-- ""k"" in lake."
mmhmm.
and then you skirt the lake along going west just skirt along the lake.
right.
and your finish is the bottom the west bottom west corner of east lake it's about an inch to the left of that.
inch to the left.
so you just your skirt goes along and reaches there.
and that's it.
and that's it.
right okay ehm.
the start's up in the top left-hand corner.
mmhmm.
have you got that.
yeah.
just ehm to the left of the burnt forest.
yeah.
okay.
mmhmm.
okay.
oh.
right.
okay.
you've got the burnt forest.
yeah.
right okay.
you're going to start coming down a bit and while you come down move slightly to the right.
mmhmm.
you're going to come down in a total of about three inches but in that you're going to have a curve which curves to the right mm.
do you know what i mean.
ehm ye--.
so you start coming down and you curve to the right and then back out to the left again so that by the time you get to three inches down you're s-- you're about just directly underneath the start again.
uh-huh yeah.
okay.
right ehm.
then you m-- move eh you go to the right about an inch and a half.
have you got a ravine.
i do yeah.
right okay.
so you're going to come up ehm to you're going to come up to the left of the ravine.
mmhmm.
then.
do you have the remote village.
ehm no.
right.
well it doesn't really matter.
you what you do is you come up eh up the left-hand side of the ravine the ravine.
mmhmm.
eh go along the top.
uh-huh.
ehm do you have the pine grove.
i do yeah.
right.
so you're going to go along ehm the top of the ravine.
mmhmm.
ehm you're about a-- an inch above the top of the ravine.
it's probably a bit too late to tell you that but ehm.
uh-huh.
and then.
you come right so you go along you're about an inch past the ravine eh you go down you're going to come down on the left-hand side of the pine grove.
mmhmm.
right okay then ehm n-- next thing you do is.
s-- right you're at the s-- s-- at the sort of bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove.
yeah.
ehm you're going to continue going down but at the same time curving to the right.
mmhmm.
ehm so you about for about ehm down d--.
have you got the concealed hideout.
i do yeah.
right so.
you're curving to the right and then start coming back in about halfway between halfway down from the pine grove to the concealed hideout.
uh-huh.
ehm s-- right.
so what you've done is you've come down you've curved to the right come back in a bit then you're going to curve back out again round the right-hand side of the concealed hideout.
is this f-- do i curve around above the concealed hideout or below to the right-hand side.
well.
you.
start off at the top of the concealed out r-- round to the right and then round under the bottom.
mmhmm.
okay.
under the bottom where it actually s-- write is written concealed hide-- hideout.
right i've got that.
okay.
right ehm.
do you have the boat house.
yeah.
right okay.
ehm right.
continue s-- in a straight line along to the boat house until you're at the ehm bottom right-hand corner of the boat house nearly at that.
mmhmm.
okay.
then you're going to go eh straight down for about an inch or a or a bit more.
do you have eh the crane bay wri-- mapped in.
no.
you don't.
yeah sorry i do i do.
you do yeah.
mmhmm.
right okay.
so you're going to come down and then follow the curve of that bay you hit do you hit you hit the bay.
mmhmm.
follow the curve of that to.
okay.
do you have the coconut palm.
no.
right.
have you got the pebbled shore.
yeah.
right.
okay s-- right.
you're going to right once you curve along the crane bay 'til you hit the bit that juts out.
mmhmm.
right.
you're going to go down you're going to sort of eh go you're going to go down not straight down curving slightly to the left.
okay.
uh-huh.
ehm and then you're going to go straight along the top of the pebbled shore about a centimetre above the pebbled shore.
okay.
mmhmm.
then once you reach the end of the pebbled shore you're going to curve down to the left not curve it's a straight line sorry it's a straight line but eh sloping to the left.
mmhmm.
ehm until you're about a good inch below the pebbled shore and you're about ehm a centimetre away from the side of the page.
yeah.
right ehm okay.
then you're going to go ehm down the side of the page for about an inch just straight down and then start curving to the right again.
mmhmm.
ehm and that's you're finished if you leave it about an centimetre from from the ehm outline of the crane bay and the flagship.
do you have the flagship there.
yeah.
right.
okay so you're.
that's it.
yeah that's it finished.
right ehm.
we're at the start.
right.
i'll write start in 'cause it's off the top of my thing.
right.
it's actually off the top of mine as well.
right.
let's start.
y-- you got the diamond mine.
re-- yeah.
right you just want to go along to the left of the diamond mine well just down from the start so you're underneath the diamond mine.
down down the left-hand side.
yeah.
so you're underneath and.
then.
right.
right.
i'm right underneath the centre of the diamond mine.
uh-huh that's right yeah.
now.
you've you sh-- you've not got a wagon wheel no.
no.
what've you got between the diamond mine and the rift valley.
where's rift valley.
up at the top right.
a cactus.
you've got a cactus.
and is that in a sort of.
it's it's underneath it.
it's it's.
un--.
underneath the rift valley.
undernea-- it's underneath the left-hand side of the valley.
you know how the valley sort of dips.
uh-huh.
right.
on the left-hand side there's a wee cactus up the top.
oh right.
it's it's right underneath that.
right.
well you want to go on a slight a a s-- well a slight gradient upwards to to your right.
right.
eh so you're just past the centre of the map i would say.
right.
ehm you should be a wee bit past the centre of the map.
now.
you want to go ehm just s-- straight up and then round so you go over the top of the rift valley and then down through the centre of it.
down through the centre.
yeah you want to go down through the centre of the rift valley.
right so i've done that.
right.
now.
have you got you've got rocks right uh eh underneath.
i've got rocks.
yeah.
you want you want to go straight down and then sort of uh ehm half way curve out slightly so you go past diagonally past the rocks to the left-hand side you're missing them by few centimetres.
right i'm at the bottom of the rocks i've done that.
you're at the bottom of the rocks.
right now.
you you've not got a stone creek to the left of the rocks have you.
a what.
a stone creek.
i've got rapids.
ehm that's to the left and slightly underneath the rocks is it.
uh-huh.
yeah.
right.
well you want to go.
is directly underneath the diamond mine.
uh-huh that's right.
you want to go down slightly from from the rock level and then curve back up and go over the the rapids so you're on s-- sort of directly on top of them.
right so i'm over them.
right.
now.
you want to eh curve down to your at at the side of the at the rapids a few centimetres out from them.
how many.
ehm sort of five centimetres.
just so you're.
shit.
you see the line ehm so you're basically in a line with the end of the very end of the swamp.
you want to go out that far.
and then.
we're eh straight down slightly curved shape a sort of eye shape so you come you come down to.
you got stone slabs.
yeah.
you want to be.
i've also got a manned fort.
right well.
you want to go straight down i don't know miss your manned fort and s-- the level you want to get to in this sort of curve is it should be directly.
am i going in a curve.
a slight curve basically s-- basically straight down and then curve slightly so you're eh right underneath the white water and just slightly above the level of the stone slabs it should be in the sort of shape of an eye.
you know the sideways shape of an eye you get at school.
that sort of idea of a curve.
right are you there.
right i'm underneath the manned fort on a level.
have you got stone creek.
yeah.
you should be above stone creek.
right.
that's where i am.
uh-huh.
on the same level as the stone slabs.
right.
now uh.
have you got to your right underneath the rocks have you got an outlaws' hideout.
saloon bar.
ah outlaws' hideout yeah.
it's above them.
yeah it's.
it's above the rocks above the gold mine.
the gold mine.
i've got a gold mine.
oh right ehm.
just it's no it's it's just below the rocks.
below the rocks right.
there's outlaws' hideout.
tha-- uh-huh that's right that's right below the rocks.
you want to go up eh in a fairly sort of well just a sort of logical gradient so you're underneath the outlaws' hideout just right underneath it.
right i'm there.
uh-huh.
now.
have you have you got a noose below the outlaws' hideout.
uh-huh.
there's a gold mine though.
above the right above the noose just just right below the outlaws' hideout slightly it's it's directly above the noose.
right.
right.
well.
you want to curve out slightly so you're to the right of the the gold mine and to the right of the noose and then just come straight down to the bottom eh right of the noose.
right that's where i am.
s-- right.
now.
you want to keep curving down to well basically keep curving down 'til you're above.
you've not got you've not got a swan pond no.
a what.
you've not got a swan pond.
no.
right well.
you want to keep curving down you're at the bottom right of the noose you want to curve down so you're just a-- ehm sort of a few centimetres five centimetres from maybe above the end.
"you know the writing at the bottom the ""n"" ""a"" ""q"" ""c"" ""6"" stuff."
yeah.
you want to be just above that and your level is about roughly the middle of the saloon bar has your level.
right i'm there.
right.
now.
a few centimetres to the left of that i've got the swan pond.
how many roughly.
ehm don't don't write anything yet by the way ehm.
i'm talking about three centimetres.
probably.
right.
i see so you've got to basically from where you are go along very slightly and then curve up over the swan pond and then back down to the same level that you're at so the curve you want to get is basically to the top of the saloon bar is the level curve up there and then curve down ehm about well see you're.
how long is this swan.
right.
the end of it is at directly down from the end of the stone slabs.
right.
so i've got that and then i go down to where i was.
y-- no n-- aye the level you were yeah that's right.
right.
and from there you want to curve eh so you're underneath the saloon bar.
underneath it.
yeah.
right.
"i'm underneath the ""o""."
and then.
"right you're underneath the ""o""."
right well.
basically this is the bit i messed up a bit last time.
the finish is just keeping going to your left and curving up past the saloon bar and it's a few ce-- it's about three or f-- maybe four centimetres out five centimetres out from the left-hand side of your page and it's just above the roof of the saloon bar and that's the finish.
where are we starting.
oh okay.
eh we're starting above the telephone kiosk.
eh.
is that is that the same with yours.
yes.
right.
we go down like come round to the side of it down.
to the right-hand side or left-hand.
to the left-hand side towards the edge of the page.
right.
is that okay same as yours yeah.
uh-huh.
eh and then.
do you have the stone circle.
no i've got.
below th-- well.
i've got a stone circle directly below telephone kiosk.
if you come down right into the corner of the page.
ehm.
uh-huh.
maybe half an inch or something from the bottom.
yeah.
into that corner.
then come across for.
well.
have you got a farmer's gate.
a broken gate.
well.
yeah same thing.
ehm if you come up go along until you're at the edge the left-hand side of that and then come up to the top left-hand side of the farmer's gate.
okay.
straight up from the from the bottom.
know what i mean.
yeah.
right.
now.
i want to head on the diagonal.
have you got meadow.
right down in the corner.
yeah down the right-hand side.
yeah.
have you got anything above that.
overnight accommodation.
overnight accommodation i haven't got any of that.
ehm right.
you want come across diagonally from the top left-hand corner the farmer's gate or bro-- broken gate whatever ehm to maybe two inches above the meadow in a slight di-- er just a very slight diagonal ehm oh to the right-hand side.
to the right-hand side of the meadow.
yeah.
you'll end up maybe th--.
hang on about.
almost in the corner well.
about th-- er.
well.
no.
about three inches.
you're coming above the meadow.
uh-huh.
eh almost maybe three inches from the edge of the page.
was that the top of the broken gate.
yeah.
sorry did i not say that.
yeah.
no.
i was just checking the list.
three inches from the edge of the page.
have you got a ruined monastery.
yeah oh above.
like sort of the middle of the page just about.
yeah.
ehm you should be just to th-- the right-hand side of that you know like down but to the right-hand side of that.
yeah.
now.
you want to ho-- eh slope up eh or move up towards the right-hand side of that if there's nothing in your way.
okay.
okay.
now.
just to bottom of the ruined monastery.
yeah.
well.
come out come to the right-hand side of it and then loop round the top.
i--.
okay.
i've got a dutch elm on my right-hand side.
you've got what.

ehm if you come down level on the left-hand side with the bottom of the ruined monastery.
level on the left.
okay.
if you've come you're like you've come round the top.
uh-huh.
eh come down to the.

the bottom left-hand side.
and then just slope k-- eh slightly down eh and come over to about an inch and a half away from the right eh the left-hand side of the page.
okay.
eh you've got the stile yeah.
up above that.
well.
if you stop eh at the left-hand si-- you know down from the left-hand side of that and then go once you're there go straight up to the top left-hand side of the stile.
over the stile.
yeah over the stile.
over the right-hand side and then just go almost directly up for about an inch and a half.
okay.
i'm going to go right through the popular tourist spot then.
well come rou-- eh.
that's just slightly to the right of the stile isn't it up and to the right.
uh-huh.

and then just go along following the lake to the left and that's us finished.
at the great viewpoint.

oh no no.
you don't need to go as far as that just to the ve-- just just kind of level with the edge of the lake.
okay.
there you go.
eh starting at the top of the caravan park.

wait a minute.
sure i don't turn left.
what you mean turn left.
if i turn right by the abandoned cottage that means i'm heading that way.
i cannae see your hands fae here.
no you cannae.
i shouldnae be doing that anyway.
uh-huh i know.
but i'm heading towards the edge of the map.
which edg-- you he-- are you heading towards your left-hand edge of the map.
my right-hand edge of the map.
yes your right-hand edge my left-hand edge.
this edge here.
oh.
right aye.
well it's it's the difference between le-- right and left i think.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
okay you're.

i told you to turn left around the old abandoned cottage you turn right once you went round the cottage.
sorry.
i've done it wrong i wasnae listening.

how many sides of the abandoned cottage have you past.
passed it twice.
you've passed twice.
should pass it again on your left.
right c--.
so you've anyway after you've turned around the cottage.
you come straight back down.
aye.
you said a hundred and eighty degrees should be three hundred sixty you should have said.
oh three hundred sixty.

you don't have a trig point.
no.
okay.
er the lake should have a a bulge in it just at the top.

'cause i've got farmed land here so.
right.
curve out have to ehm.
is it a sort of straight line out or just a you know to the right or s-- just curved lands out.
eh just sloping very slightly.
downwards.
right.
very slightly ehm.
curve out about five six centimetres.
right.
right okay.
and curve round and then ehm go straight along to the bottom of the dead tree.
so curve round and then straight along to the bottom.
uh-huh.
of the dead tree.
right.
i'm still on the right-hand side of the river is that right.
uh well.
you've curved out towards the right so you're like in the middle of the river now kind of thing where the dead tree is at the bottom of that.

computer controlled sub that's all.
oh right.
oh right.
ehm now.
see if you go from the tip of the lagoon and uh down to the left but you'll need to curve out a bit as though.
'cause i've got a rock fall there.
so.
so.
i w-- i want to curve out to the left.
uh-huh yeah.
eh heading heading for where the top of green bay.
eh right.
you know how where there's ehm.
let me see.
know how where sandy shore is that line towards the left.
uh-huh.
it comes right down to the bottom forms a tip.
yeah.
if you go to there.
right.
so i'm in a sort of line down from that sort of thing.
uh-huh yeah.

right.
and just above the green.
uh-huh.

straight down a few centimetres to the right right.
i've got computer controlled sub that i better.
uh-huh right.
avoid.
and i finish at the left of the pirate ship.
uh-huh yeah.
right.
at the bottom.
uh-huh.
right that's it.
okay.
if you move down about four or five centimetres and around to the east about ten twelve centimetres past the springboks.
right okay.
right what was that last one.
about ten ten centimetres along past the springboks.
okay.
mm.
and go around the springboks to the northwest.
springbok.
about three centimetres.
northwest three.
then move around past the highest viewpoint just go up right up around it.
and then down about eight centimetres.
mmhmm.
and to the southwest past the safari's truck truck about six or seven centimetres.
and along by the field station to the west around ten centimetres.
and around the banana tree down fifteen centimetres to the bottom of the gold mine.
got that.
mm so so.
along to the east by the gold mine until you get to like edge of the gold mine.
what wh-- how far would that be.
ehm about f-- three centimetres.
mmhmm.
and then up to the rope bridge.
mmhmm.
and cross the rope bridge.
and then move round down south about to the giraffes.
okay.
and around to around the giraffes' feet.
if you see what i mean.
mmhmm.
and along to the west for about six no 'bout eight centimetres.
mmhmm right.
and then down to the southwest about three centimetres.
mmhmm.
and then to the west about eight centimetres 'til the edge of the great lake the furthest west point of the great lake.
okay.
and then just go round up to the finish.
what finish.
oh sorry.
ehm up to about up to the northwest about four five centimetres that's it.
mmhmm.
we're.
starting down at the bottom right-hand corner nearly.
right.
ha-- have you got crest falls.
mmhmm.
well directly above them maybe about three quarters of an inch above there is the start point.
yeah.
eh.
go along to the the left.
my left or the paper's left towards the banana tree.
there's no banana tree in this one.
well.
my left yeah paper left.
uh-huh right.
uh-huh.
well say the top's north and.
right.
go west.
eh.
okey-dokey.
until you've just got past the edge of the crest falls.
right.
and then.
"come down until you reach a an angle maybe just past south towards west slightly past until you reach the bottom of crest falls and le-- a level with the ""c"" and maybe about an inch to west of the ""c""."
mm.
okey-dokey.
right.
and then go due west until about two centimetres from the edge of the paper.
right.
now.
do you have a footbridge.
n-- just north of the banana tree.
yeah.
right.
go up north now until you're just due north until you're just below the the level of the footbridge.
mmhmm.
and then from there go over right to the edge of the the the western side of footbridge.
mmhmm.
right.
and then the path s-- the path starts again at the other side of the footbridge.
now.
do you have a poisoned stream there.
no not at all.
well.
just at the the footbridge next to when you come off there's a poisoned stream.
so when you come off the footbridge you have to go due south maybe about an inch and a half.
right.
uh-huh.
and then.
och t-- take a wee bit more to be safe just a wee touch more.
mmhmm.
and then do you have an old temple.
yes.
right.
go along eastward for about two inches.
mmhmm.
and then curve up until you're at the bottom of the old temple.
rightee-ho.
mmhmm.
now.
go up about two and a half inches.
do you have anything above the old temple in that area up there.
nothing.
up until a poisoned stream.
right.
what about do you have an abandoned truck.
what way to the left of it.
uh-huh.
yeah.
is there anything between the old temple and the truck.
eh slate mountain.
right.
i don't have that.
mmhmm.
ehm.
loo-- go two and a half inches up over the temple the up the side of it.
right.
and then.
and then say an angle of northwest forty-five degrees.
mmhmm.
go up for about two inches that would probably take you past the top of the.
up past the truck and the mountain.
something uh-huh.
right.
and then b-- back down at the same angle to well the opposite angle anyway to get you down to th-- your abandoned truck just below it.
right.
and then go straight across the bottom of the abandoned truck.
mmhmm.
"until you're just below the ""a""."
right.
now.
have you got baboons.
no.
right.
now come due south.
yeah.
about an inch and a half to an inch and three quarters.
mmhmm.
and then.
due west for about two inches.
uh then.
right.
do you have a white mountain further up.
yes.
uh-huh.
right.
now.
"well the best thing to do first of all would be come back up to where you were at the ""a"" and the come up to make that a ""u"" shape."
mmhmm.
and then.
draw a line straight between this point and maybe about half a centimetre to the west of the bottom of the white mountain.
right.
right.
now mm.
go up the side of the mountain until you're maybe follow the side for up until about half an inch below the summit.
mmhmm.
and then change to going due north for about three inches.
up past the lemon grove.
ah there's no lemon grove in this one.
right.
right.
is there a pyramid.
mmhmm.
yeah.
now.
this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid.
mmhmm.
and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid.
will we walk to the top of it.
no.
straight across until.
right.
on the same level.
okey-dokey.
and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid.
yeah.
right.
do you have a cobbled street.
no.
right.
below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and.
directly below it.
ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid.
right so it'll be.
mmhmm.
now.
"from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid."
right.
and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip.
right.
right.
go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south.
right.
to avoid the cobbled street there.
and do you have a remote village.
mmhmm.
and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are.
yeah.
just about a centimetre to the west of the l-- thick line and stop there.
right.
now.
"curve round draw a curve until you're below the ""r"" of remote."
mmhmm.
and then.
"straight across until you're below the ""e""."
"the ""e"" in remote."
"the ""e"" in village sorry."
"""e"" in village."
right.
and then.
go straight across another inch and that's the finish.
okey-dokey there we go.
have i missed anything.
okay.
we're s-- we're starting in the top left-hand corner.

right okay.
right okay.
then go straight up to above the mountain.

no it's just it's.
you you just come straight down right.
yeah.
it's a straight line down.
okay so you're.
okay.
vertical line.
now.
now you've got to drop down about well i'd like to say well i'd like to say about an inch.
why didn't you just go straight down from the start sign it would've been easier.
yeah you're not kidding.
i mean it's just straight down from there.
ehm.
okay.
have you got a rock fall marked.
uh-huh.
okay.
come down to towards come come down towards the rock fall until you're just b-- until you're just above the rock fall.
mmhmm.
okay.
right okay in a straight line.
and now head across for.
oops.
the r-- now head across to the rope bridge you can just go straight straight across from there to the rope bridge.
there's nothing in between.
yeah.
nothing in between.
right.
i've got to go like on top of the rock fall.
that kind of line.
li-- like.
you want.
well.
you you want to go you you drop straight down to to the to the rock fall now and you want to head from the rock fall straight across to the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
mmhmm.
aye well not straight across but you you're you'll be going back up towards the rope bridge.
just.
right.
so i'm below the rope the rope bridge then.
so so you're at the moment you're below the rope bridge.
and you're you're coming across in a diagonal towards the rope bridge going going from your right and up the way going to the right and up the way.
mmhmm.
right.
so i'm heading for the rope.
heading for the rope bridge yeah.
bridge okay.
just go straight to the rope bridge.
from there in like a uh-huh a diagonal line then from the rock fall.
yeah that's right yeah.
you don't want me to go across and up.
no just straight just a diagonal line up to the rope bridge.
okay then.
right.
and then a-- across the rope bridge to the right-hand side of the page.
oh from the the top of the rope bridge or.
yeah across the top of the rope bridge.
right okay.
i've went and drawn this.
can i go up and across because i've went and drawn it to the bottom of the rope bridge i can just go up and across.
yeah fine yeah.
and across the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
right i've done that.
have you got giraffes marked.
uh-huh.
i've got crocodiles as well.
crocodiles.
well you'll have to avoid the crocodiles as well but but you've got to go round the the the giraffes at the bottom right-hand corner of the page.
so i just go straight down right.
yeah that's right mmhmm.
okay i just go straight down.
and then i've reached the bottom of the gi-- of the giraffes.
d-- okay.
okay.
now the only thing you've got to dodge is the great lake.
i've got that on.
you've got that marked.
uh-huh.
now the great the great lake on my map is in the bottom left-hand.
yeah.
i've got that as well.
corner it's di-- directly below the rock fall.
mmhmm.
so you've got t--.
and parallel to the disused warehouse.
i don't have a a disused warehouse on mine.
oh right.
well i-- it's just parallel to it like just ehm well not underneath the giraffes you know over to the left.
yeah.
well i i would come down c-- i i would head right yeah on according to my map you've got to go ehm down towards the bottom of the page and underneath the great lake.
uh-huh.
underneath it.
yeah.
you want you want to go below the below the lake.
okay.
the lake's in the b-- the lake in mine is b-- directly below the l-- the rock fall.
and you've got to come below the the great lake from from the giraffes.
uh-huh.
you can you can just come straight across i would not straight across and down a bit.
so oh right okay right.
right.
and below the great lake.
okay oops.
and turn r-- turn right once you've gone past the lake and come up.
to just belo-- yeah turn have you.
turn right.
that's i've just drawn a a line left just now turning right would just be going back again.
you've drawn a line you've.
you've drawn a line yeah wait a minute hold on right you've drawn a line left.
uh-huh.
coming across towards the great lake.
uh-huh.
well it's over the d-- great i mean i've went under the.
okay.
great lake uh-huh.
you've gone under it.
right.
go up the page.
go up it.
up yeah towa--.
towards the rock fall.
up well not towards ehm stay on the left-hand side but go up.
where from.
ehm until you're just about half an inch below the rock fall and that's the finish.
where from which bit of the great lake.
the left or the right.
the great lake right.
you've come right under the great lake.
uh-huh.
ehm you've got to the far left-hand edge of the great lake.
mmhmm.
ehm head up until you're level with the giraffes.
okay.
so we're on the far side of the.
the the l-- giraffes.
head up until you're level with the giraffes' kneecaps.
just to be exact.
right.
so we're on the the left-hand side of the great lake.
yeah.
oh right okay.
so we just head up here until we're up to the kneecaps.
yeah.
that's us.
okay.
yeah we've done it.
that's us.
right i'll draw this line again.
can you d-- redraw a line.
yeah i think so yeah.
right okay it's just i drew this line wrong okay.
i think we've got it.
right.
i think that's it it looks.
i'd like to see this.
er you've got the start right.
above a camera shop.
you've you've got a camera shop.
right.
you've not got there's a park van parked van just below that.
right.
it's about three or four centimetres down from that.
right okay.
eh what you're going to do is go in between the camera shop and the left-hand side of the page.
right.
uh-huh.
see how there's about a centimetre.
yeah.
you go from the start sort of do a curve to get back onto the line and go down due south for bddllpp eh.
right.
just missing the camera shop.
just missing the camera shop yeah.
right.
is there allotments.
down to where's the allotments.
yes there is.
oh you go down about double the length of that.
see between the start and the allotments.
uh-huh.
do the same distance again between that in fact a wee bit more i'd say about twelve thirteen centimetres down to the bottom.
down.
right.
right okay.
so you should be about a centimetre away from the left-hand side of the page and about two s-- two or three centimetres above the bottom.
the bottom of the page.
right.
oh wait a minute wh-- fr-- how many centimetres from the w--.
about one centimetre from the left-hand side of the page.
oh right.
well so going back a bit.
yeah.
right okay then i know right i know what i'm doing now.
uh-huh uh-huh right.
okay.
right okay.
you've just g-- really got a straight line down from the start missing the camera shop.
right aye right i've got it.
"okay eh now i've got a parked van here so i'm just trying to go round it you're sort of doing a ""u"" shape back round past where my parked van is so just go east for about four five centimetres."
right okay.
right.
so you're going aiming towards the yacht club but you're going nowhere near as far as that.
right.
right.
so i'm just like below the allotments just now.
below it not as far along as that.
are you at whereabouts what letter are you under in the allotments.
oh right.
no i'm no i'm just actually.
all right.
just before it i'm not actually touched the allotments yet.
all right that's good that's good.
because what you're doing is you're going up the side of the allotments.
right okay i'm just.
"so you're doing you're continuing that ""u"" shape from where you were at the start you're sort of going back up heading north towards the side of the allotments."
right.
right.
see the wee black house at the left-hand side of the allotments.
am i just going straight up.
yes straight up f-- from there right.
right.
is that all right.
right okay right.
right so you're at the s-- you're at the.
i'm at the wee black house now at the left of the allotments.
at the wee black house that's brilliant that's brilliant.
right.
"so have you got a sort of ""u""-shaped a sort of half ""u"" shape."
yeah.
right that's okay that's fine.
okay.
right this is where it gets difficult.
eh.
right.
'cause you're aiming into the middle of nowhere there's about.
i've got a yacht club right.
at the bottom right-hand side.
ehm.
uh-huh right.
right.
see if you forget about the line for a minute if you pick a point about sssh.
see the edge of the left-hand yacht right.
uh-huh.
the bottom edge of it the corner.
right.
if you aim above that for about six centimetres right.
right.
a point up there.
uh-huh.
if you can draw a diagonal line from the wee black house in the allotments up to the top up to the where that point is about six centimetres.
a-- have you got a flight museum.
i've not no.
have you got a flight museum in the middle somewhere.
right.
ehm.
see what you're.
right.
i've got a flight.
right.
if i go up from the bottom left-hand corner of this yacht if i go up about six centimetres.
right.
i'm just like about one centimetre from this to the left of this eh to the right of this flight museum.
one centimetre to the right o--.
but i suppose ehm i suppose if i draw a line from that wee house it might just miss the flight museum.
i think that's o-- pff.
right well what you're doing is you're drawing a line it's not exactly eh east right it's sort of between two and three o'clock it's very very gradual incline up for about fourteen centimetres twelve.
right i n-- i know what i know what what you're doing.
see what i'm.
doing i'm going up on a.
yeah.
right okay.
i-- uh it's just at the bottom of my flight museum.
c-- aye.
it's sort of between two and three o'clock.
aye that's.
right.
alright i know where you are.
its at the bottom of your flight museum.
uh-huh it's the bottom of my flight museum.
so you should be eh you sh--.
and have you got a telephone box further up.
i've got it aye that's a way up at the uh-huh.
ah i'm just like underneath the telephone box about like about fif-- fourteen centimetres away from the telephone box.
are you directly underneath that are you as far.
it's.
"no no i'm underneath ah well i'm about nearly underneath the ""t""."
a wee bit aye.
right that's fine that's fine.
right is that where i should be.
that's great actually that's exactly it.
right okay.
right.
you've got a disused monastery.
uh-huh.
haven't you.
"see from where you are just now under the ""t"" away down a wee bit fifteen centimetres down."
uh-huh.
you're going up and you're just doing a wee hill over the monastery from the right of the monastery t-- over to the left.
right.
you're just doing a big bump right over it.
do you see what i mean.
right so i i i go up do i go up straight first.
go up just well y-- any way you want really.
this d-- this sort of does a curve just over the top of the monastery going from right to left.
right okay.
right over the top of it.
okay.
and you're going down to just to the bottom left-hand side to the mona-- the disused monastery.
there's there's this wee black box just there.
right uh-huh.
you're just going just a wee bit below that.
okay.
right.
right.
eh now you've got a have you got an alpine garden.
uh-huh.
you have right.
all you're doing is you're sort of doing see that wee f-- f-- bump you've got over the monastery at the moment.
yeah.
you're sort of doing that in reverse and going up towards the alpine garden so you do the bump in reverse and end up just going straight north up the left-hand side of the alpine garden.
do you see what i mean.
"so that if you turned the sheet on its side it'd be a big ""s""."
right.
right okay.
right.
but i've g-- have you got a west lake.
eh i've not no.
have you got a west lake in the middle somewhere.
yeah.
but i've missed the west lake.
oh you aye.
draw round it.
don't suppose i'll go through it.
oh score it out somewhere.
right okay right right i know what i know what i'm doing.
eh so you're.
right.
so you're going up so you go up to the alpine garden you're just going sort of straight north to the.
and now a bit of i've a a couple of centimetres from the left-hand side of the page.
yes that's right.
right okay.
that's exactly y-- have you got a picket fence at the top.
uh-huh.
"you're sort of under the ""n"" or ""c"" or something of the picket fence but you're about f-- about ten centimetres down well."
yeah now that's.
you're just at the top left of the alpine garden.
that's right.
right.
right i'm at the top left of the alpine garden.
have you got a youth hostel which is.
no.
no you've not.
i've got a parked van away up the top.
i've just noticed that there.
aye the parked the parked van's got nothing.
oh god it's moved.
aye.
he doesn't he doesn't go anywhere.
right.
your yacht club should be nothing as well at the moment.
that should be in the middle of nowhere.
right okay.
eh you've got the alpine garden at the top le-- eh you're at the top left of the alpine garden right.
right that's me.
"you're under ""n"" or ""c"" or something like that of picket fence."
uh-huh.
right.
eh what you're doing now is you're going along to the right just above the top of the alpine garden whatever those if that's weeds or something eh you're going along for two to three centimetres.
okay.
right so i'm going to the right of the alpine garden a-- the top of it.
uh-huh to the right uh-huh.
the top just straight across right.
right okay.
"and you should be above the ""d"" end above the ""d"" of garden but you're un-- on top of the you know."
right that's me.
right.
and then you're j-- going just due north for three c-- another three or four centimetres.
right.
right.
eh have you got a level crossing to the right.
okay.
have i got ah no i haven't no.
i just wondered if i was.
have you have you got a thatched.
no you've not i'd had this out with neil a thatched mud hut.
you've not got that no.
no.
eh you've got the park--.
right i've gone up about three centimetres.
right.
so you should be sort of halfway between your alpine garden and your parked van really if you know what i mean.
ah right okay i'll go up a wee bit.
right is that right round about there.
i'll go up a wee bit further.
right okay that's about it.
eh.
right.
then you're going now where are you you've just gone north haven't you.
i've just gone north up towards the parked van.
right okay.
eh now go right for about two centimetres.
okay.
right okay.
just a straight line right for two centimetres.
so have you got this parked van.
yeah.
"you should be under the let-- under the letter ""v"" i think round about ""v""."
what wh-- what l-- letter.
right okay that's me.
right okay so you're about two to three centimetres below the parked van at the moment.
uh-huh that's me.
just right right.
you've got that point there now you've got your telephone box right.
aye.
"see the letter ""t""."
uh-huh.
draw a line from where you are at the moment diagonally right down it's a southeast.
uh-huh.
it's a big massive diagonal line it's about fifteen centimetres long or something like that.
right down to the b--.
"right down to the letter ""t"" right down to the bottom."
t-- to the top of it.
or the bottom of it right okay.
to the bottom of it sorry.
"just underneath the letter ""t""."
okay.
right that's me.
right.
and then all you.
this looks quite nice.
fra-- frame it and.
sorry.
i'm quite pleased.
oh you should have seen neil's we had to start all over again you know.
had to do that with dawn anyway.
right.
eh.
"we're at the bottom of the ""t""."
"we're underneath the letter ""t"" at the moment."
"go along just sort of underline telephone box just a t-- a fraction underneath telephone underline it right to the letter ""x""."
right.
right.
right okay.
"and you just go to the edge of the letter ""x""."
right.
right.
you're on the right-hand side of it.
uh-huh.
then all you're doing is going up for about another three centimetres to just just above the top of the telephone box.
right.
about half a centimetre above the top of the telephone box.
okay.
right.
now this is where you've not got a thatched mud hut.
oh.
eh you've got an east lake haven't you.
aye.
right uh-huh.
away at the top.
of the page yeah.
eh well what you're wanting to do is you see the bottom of the east lake the the line that's going down sort of diagonally sort of.
uh-huh.
the bottom right-hand corner.
uh-huh.
"well you're wanting see the ""k"" of lake."
uh-huh.
"you're wanting to end up just about half a centimetre away from the bottom of the lake itself but underneath the letter ""k""."
right.
right okay.
but don't draw a straight diagonal line.
okay.
because you want to from where you are just now you're above the telephone box that right.
right.
uh-huh i'm above the telephone box.
you're wanting to sort of go it's a sort of curve aiming to the left and then going straight north.
"do you know what i mean it's like th-- the left-hand side of a ""u"" or something like that right."
right.
you're at the bottom of.
have y-- have you got this le--.
oh you've not got this level crossing on have you.
i've not got a level crossing no.
right okay.
so whe-- whereabouts is this mud m-- m-- m-- this thatched mud hut.
eh so you're.
mu-- thatched mud hut it's directly above the telephone box at the moment.
so that's what you're trying to avoid if you can imagine a thatched mud hut sort of halfway between the telephone box and the bottom right-hand corner of the east lake.
right you're sort of going left.
right.
so i'm wanting to go left.
"and then north up to just below the ""k"" but on the don't go into the lake just stay outside it."
right okay.
i kind of right i see that's that there right.
right.
do you sort of see where i'm going.
i know you're going.
"so you should have a sort of a ""u"" shape there."
but i've got this stupid level crossing.
oh forget it oh you can go-- you can walk across that.
right i'll just go up this side of it right.
i think i've missed it.
right.
right okay.
right.
and then you're so you're just underneath the bottom.
"i'm about ha-- i'm about ya-- under the ""k""."
right that's right.
i'm not in the lake though.
that's right.
just you know the bottom of the lake it's sort of going diagonally.
uh-huh.
follow that the bottom of the lake right up keep about half a centimetre away from it and follow it up to the left.
right.
to the bottom corner of the lake the pointy bit.
see it.
oh right this i-- this is to the left this is towards the parked van.
have you got a pointy bit.
yes this is t-- aiming towards the parked van.
right okay right okay.
so you're right under the bottom corner at the moment.
uh-huh.
right.
and just continue that line for about another centimetre and that's the finish just in the exact same.
just below that wee bump.
that's be-- just below the wee bump that's it.
right okay.
exactly.
and that's it.
right.
ah.
that's it very good.
no problem.
that was that was a lot easier than the one with neil i'll tell you that.
we're a team.
yeah.
right.
at the bot-- bottom of the map on the right-hand side have you got a missionary camp there.
i've got the starts marked.
right okay.
to the left right have you got ehm what is it it says gorillas with two gorillas and you know trees two tree.
no.
no.
no.

go two centimetres to the left.
right.
okay.
go down.

just right down uh-huh.
right.
i'm i've stopped right above it.
then.
you've what.
i'm right above the missionary camp.
just go right down to round down to the bottom of the r-- left-hand side of it.
right.
okay.
so go round it.

okay.
mmhmm yeah.
that's the finish i think.
right.
yup.

uh-huh.
so as we can er it'll be fae the perspective of the viewer.
right is is the guy walking along.
how can i.
right.
right the guy is standing so that the diamond mine will be on his left-hand side.
okay.
mmhmm.
right.
now you walk down just past it.
just past the diamond mine.
aye and turn to your left.
so that's in below the diamond mine towards the centre of the page.
and that's correct.
okay.
right now.
there's a graveyard on your left-hand side.
no.
the diamond mine's on my left-hand side.
well walk towards the centre of the page.

you want me above the canoes.
i don't ken anything about canoes.
oh they're directly below the below the fast running creek.
well go up to the top of the page keeping the fast running creek to your right-hand side.
okay so when it's when i come past the diamond mine i've to go diagonally towards the fast running creek.
well no you go along and then up.
along and then up.
aye.
but keep your fast flowing creek on your right-hand side.
on my right-hand side.
right and you circuit it.
circuit it.
keeping it on your right-hand side.
right okay.
then come straight back down the paper.
through the apache camp.
no.
go down towards the apache camp.

a pretend semicircle to the.
well like you know a pretend loop.
inside or the outs--.
aye.
to the inside or the outside of the map.
right start right so you're just below the cliffs.
i'm just below the cliffs.
right.
so you go out towards outside of the map.
towards the outside of the map right.
yeah and then round the bottom of the forge which isn't there.
which isn't there.
but it's on on the same level as the pine tree.
right okay.
right.
and then you go up the inside of the pine tree.
the inside.
right not th-- no that the left of the pine tree so the that's outside of the map.
t-- t-- to the left of the pine tr--.

uh-huh.
the pine tree is always on my right.
yeah.
okay.
and then so you get to the top of the pine tree.
top of the pine tree.

vertically across.
horizontally sorry.
right so i'm going across the page right.
uh-huh.
have you got a pine forest.
on right.
yes.
well you slope down with the pine forest on your right.
pine forest on my right f--.
aha so don't go round the pine forest just like pass down by it.

right okay.
right.
and then just where the word pine forest is.
"just stop at the ""p""."
right.
"right stop at the ""p""."
right.
right.
and then sort of loop round a wee bit more don't don't draw your line in the same angle sort of make it a bit flatter and then draw another wee loop.
a bit flatter th-- what on the same.
does this have have i to cross a stream.
what.
have i to cross a stream.
no.
i haven't got a stream.
eh.
i suppose just avoid the stream.
but g-- sort of like as though.
it runs.
you're drawing a nose right say this is the face you're drawing and then you've got to sort of do a sort of round bit for the nose.
is that beneath so is the nose to come beneath the pine forest.
beneath the pine forest.
uh-huh.
okay right.
right.
have you got a bakery underneath right a bit lower down.
yes.
right so see when the nose comes out it comes back in to the face.
comes back in yes.
right.
that should be just above the bakery.
right.
is that okay.
okay.
and then go and do another big nose round the bakery.
round the bakery.
uh-huh.
and then come right back in.
okay.
un-- underneath the bakery and maybe in past the bakery about two centimetres just before the canal.
have you got a canal.
no i don't have a canal.

yes.
right.
sort of don't go vertically down it but start sloping down towards around the top of the rocket warehouse.
around the top of the w-- rocket warehouse.
uh-huh.
right okay.
and then slope the line right out to the side of the page.
right out to the side of the page.
uh-huh.
right.
the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a.
are you about th-- in line with the rocket bit or have you done that.
no.
i'm past the rocket.
no but like s-- see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written.
oh aye near enough.
right.
so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page.
down the side of the page.
for about two centimetres.
right.
and then curve it back in towards the old.
light house don't have a cave.
past the cave.
well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse.
you going to hit it.
yes if i go in.

okay.
and then.
do you have a tribal settlement.
no.
well go along the bottom of the page and.

and a couple in from the bottom of the page.
right.
okay right right.
and then.
have you got a rope bridge.
yeah.
well go straight up until you're to just to the le-- left of the rope bridge and then go across it from left to right.
okay.
okay.
when you get to the other side of the rope bridge go down about a centimetre immediately.
okay.
okay.
or a couple of centimetres.
is that the machete there.
aye well yeah that's right.
have you got a machete.
i haven't got that.
so avoid the machete i suppose you must go under it.
right okay.
okay so you go you go down probably a couple of centimetres after you get to the other side of the rope bridge.

and then you go along to the right.
right.
until you're just above the start again.
okay right got you.

okay.
directly up.
uh-huh straight up.
right okay.
without going left or right.
have you not got a crevasse there no.
eh no.
no so it's a centimetre above the saxon barn.
uh-huh.
but you're not anywhere near it you're above the collapsed shelter.
yeah.
i'm right to the right of it yeah.
okay.
right.
so you must have the crevasse beside the saxon barn.
go over the top of the crevasse then.
okay.
left.
uh-huh.
go left and then down the left-hand the right-hand side of the saxon barn.
oh.
and under the saxon barn.

uh-huh.
then when you get there go down ehm a couple of centi-- go down about an inch a couple of centime-- centimetres.
mmhmm.

right.
mmhmm.
so go down a couple of centimetres when you're at the bottom left-hand side of the saxon barn.
saxon barn.
right.
and then go along a couple of centimetres.
to the left yeah.
to the left.
until you're a coup-- mm about a centimetre and a half in from the side of the page.
and then go up again straight up until you're about level with saxon barn.
okay.
oh oh.
which is it the top bottom of it which part.

okay.
okay.
right.
right.

yeah there's nothing nothing there.
right okay.
well.
are you at the top of the white mountain.
yeah.
i'm just top and to the left of it.
that's fine.
go s-- go straight up about three or four centimetres.
okay.
right.
and then do a sharp turn to the right towards the slate mountain.
uh-huh.
have you got that.
yeah.
do you want me to just put below the slate mountain.
ah.
just to the left of it.
right just below and to the left okay.
okay.
right i'm there.
and then do a circle right round the slate mountain 'til you come back to the ehm bottom left-hand side of it again.
so you want to go d-- i'm going round anticlockwise yeah.
all the way round it.
uh-huh.
um no.
clockwise sorry.
so i just go up and round.
right you start off sort of.
going up and round.
just to the left of it.
right.
and then you go up the side of it.
uh-huh.
over the summit down the right-hand side of it and underneath it.
right.
uh-huh.
okay.
okay.
back just about back to where i started near enough.
that's right.
just back to the b-- bottom left-hand side of the slate mountain.
okay.
okay.
okay.
have you got a secret valley.
yeah.
yes.
right well.
you're at the bottom left-hand side of the slate mountain right.
uh-huh.
go straight down past the left-hand side of the secret valley until you're at the bottom left-hand side of that.
okay.
okay.
got you.
and then go underneath it 'til you're at the bottom right-hand side of it.
okay.
and that's the finish.
okay.
okay.
right.
start just above a telephone kiosk.
yeah.
the thing the cross that says start yeah.
does it.
uh-huh.
right.
now you go down on the the left-hand side the telephone.
the left-hand side right.
down past the stone circle.
the what.
the stone circle.
i've not got a stone circle.
you got a have you got a broken gate to the right and at the bottom of the telephone kiosk.
yeah.
and underneath right underneath the s-- telephone kiosk at the bottom there's a stone circle.
oh right.
i don't have that.
now.
how f-- roughly how far down is that.
eh say about five centimetres on the map.
right.
so it's about in a l-- in a straight down from telephone kiosk.
yeah.
and about in a line with the the writing of broken gate roughly.
yeah.
the broken gate ends the left-hand side of broken gate is the right-hand side the stone circle.
right.
whe-- whe--.
and where's the st-- the other side the stone circle eh.
eh the left-hand side of the telephone kiosk.
right.
and the bottom it's just at the writing of broken gate or.
no.
it's it's eh it's about three centimetres down from the broken gate.
right.
which is called farmer's gate.
right.
so i want to go from start to underneath.
underneath the stone circle.
sort of it's directly down from telephone kiosk.
yeah.
right.
right i'm there.
right.
you're underneath it.
uh-huh.
right.
you go up past the end of the stone circle.
eh underneath the broken gate.
no.
you go up past the stone circle.
and around the top of the the farmer's gate the gate.
so i go between the the circle the stone circle and the gate then.
yeah.
so that's quite a small space is it i i presume.
yeah.
right.
and where where should i end up.
just stop above the farmer's gate.
right.
directly above it.
yeah.
right.
you there.
uh-huh straight above it.
right now.
do you have the meadow.
yeah i do.
on the bottom r-- bottom right.
right.
well.
uh-huh.
you just ignore that completely.
right.
uh-huh.
what do well basically you go up sort of a very slight diagonal line until you're above the meadow.
right.
so it's just a sort of very small gradient above the meadow.
yeah.
right.
right.
have you got what have you got the lake.
no.
no.
i'm i'm und-- at the moment i'm underneath overnight accommodation and just almost in the i'm just in the beginning of the meadow.
i don't have that.
i don't have overnight accommodation.
right well.
that's just eh if you take the the left of the meadow and go straight up to eh then the overnight accommodation is straight up from the left of the meadow and it's just slightly above the well it's actually in a line with the start writing.
"if you put a wee ""x"" there for overnight accommodation."
yeah well.
that's that'll be that's probably where you should go then.
if that's overnight accommodation probably want go there.
oh.
wh-- where's your map say to go.
it doesn't say go anywhere it just it turns turns northwards.
oh right i see.
a-- at that point.
so i so it's going to overnight accommodation then.
yeah.
where's it head after that.
right.
well it goes.
i'll just just tell briefly and then i'll go to overnight accommodation we'll start again just sort of point of interest.
it goes up for it goes up for about ten ten or twelve centimetres it skirt-- it goes round the north of the the ruined monastery.
right right well.
i'll i'll move into overnight accommodation.
and it just goes straight up from where i say overnight accommodation would be just right up northwards yeah.
oh.
where how f-- is it is your overnight accommodation directly above the meadow.
it's the middle of of it's a wee a wee house the middle of it is straight up from the meadow.
right.
on the left of the meadow yo-- the the far left the meadow straight up from there.
yeah.
just above the wee birds.
yeah above the wee birds uh-huh.
right that's tha-- the-- right i know where you are.
and sight and eh the start of it is s-- straight across from the start writing.
right that's it.
so.
right.
that's that's where on my map is.
uh-huh.
so i just want to go up from there.
uh-huh.
which side of the ruined monastery should i sort of be coming out at the right side.
oh have you got the ruined monastery.
yeah.
the ruined monastery's.
right.
you should go up the right side and over over the top and down the left.
sort of ta--.
but then stop once you're at the left side of it.
right.
right.
right.
so i go straight up round to the right over the top and down by the left.
yeah.
and how far down so i'm just sort of where the writing is on the left-hand side.
just.
yeah just about there.
right right i'm there.
are you.
uh-huh.
right.
we go w-- eh left right along.
'cause there's a lake just underneath that there's west lake.
have you got that.
no.
i've only got east lake i've not got west lake.
right.
we-- west lake is between the start and where you are and it's sort of a big circle and it's the b-- eh the the top of it's just just very just underneath the ruined monastery writing.
uh-huh.
so it's just a sort of big circle.
so if you draw that in.
right.
it starts just under the ruined monastery it goes to the start.
and now what is it.
well.
it's it's sort of.
what's this.
ne-- excuse me.
it's above the start whereas the th-- what is it it's a sort of eh.
how can i describe the shape.
it go so straight along the top straight straight down the right-hand side.
right.
just along a wee bit then a diagonal line up so it's like a triangle.
uh.
fo-- you could join the bottom of the lake with the start and the and the left-hand side of it to make a triangle.
you join the the bottom.
oh see i've not got the bottom lake.
the bottom lake's the start you say.
yeah.
uh-huh.
but it doesn't go right the way along to the start it stops about halfway.
right.
right okay.
right.
i've got that roughly.
and where's the next point in the triangle just under the ruined monastery.
eh no wait a minute.
what have you drawn.
i've got a.
a line along the top.
a line right a straight line along the top.
right.
from from where i am sort of thing.
yeah.
right.
it's not really straight but it's but it's easier to draw it straight.
oh.
right uh-huh.
right i've got that.
then.
straight line down the right-hand side.
eh to just the start bit down from down from where where's it start going down from the stile or from the start or what.
eh it's going down towards the start.
right.
straight down or sort of diagonally down towards it.
sort of s-- straight down.
right.
and the other one's sort of.
it goes about three centimetres towards uh it stops at the start you know.
uh-huh s-- right.
in line with it it goes about three centimetres towards it.
right.
right.
and then goes up in a diagonal line for about five six centimetres.
right.
and then.
it g-- and then it joins with the start i-- it joins with the top.
right okay f--.
right.
five fi--.
right.
i've got the sort of basic shape anyway so i should be able to a-- avoid it.
avoid it.
right.
that's west lake.
right.
so.
you're currently stopped in line with the ruined monastery wording.
i should be above i should be slightly above the lake then am i.
yeah.
uh-huh right.
right.
you go left along 'til you're in line with the left-hand side of the stile.
right.
then go up and over the top the stile and stop there.
straight up over the stile.
straight up.
and ehm.
as soon as you reach the top the stile turn right and go along 'til you reach the end it.
right.
so i'm over the stile i've turn right 'til i reach the end of the stile.
right.
uh-huh.
so that's just sort of a few centimetres.
uh-huh.
right.
then you stop.
uh-huh.
right.
you go n-- go north for about three centimetres.
right.
and then go along for about one centimetre one or two i'd say two.
so i'm at the bo-- i'm sort of at the left-hand bottom of the popular tourist spot castle thing.
or have you not got that.
i don't have that.
right.
it says great viewpoint.
it's miles away from that wha--.
there's w-- a great viewpoint.
yeah great viewpoint's awa-- quite a bit above it.
yeah.
and to the left yeah.
yeah you should be there.
so right.
i'm i'm there.
is there any hazards round about here then.
then you go along.
eh no there's nothing on my map.
right.
right.
so go about two centimetres along.
eh to my right.
to your right.
uh-huh.
then take a diagonal route down.
have you got the dead tree marked.
the dutch elm.
it says dead tree.
is it er underneath the rocket launch pad at your right.
eh.
i don't have a l-- a rocket launch pad.
right well.
underneath the e--.
e-- don't have east lake either do you.
well.
yeah i've got the east lake.
sort of right well it's just sort of ten centimetres down from the right-hand side of the east lake.
is that right.
oh i don't have that.
ah my my east lake's top hand right corner.
yeah.
that's where i've got the lake.
uh-huh.
and there's a great viewpoint just underneath it.
have you got that.
no.
i've my great viewpoint's the the opposite corner.
oh i've got two v-- great viewpoints.
ah right i see.
right so i've got a great viewpoint just underneath the lake.
s--.
but the-- there's a tree it's sort of black and wee branches it's g-- it's oh it's dead it's got no leaves on it.
yeah i don't i don't have.
right.
i don't have it in the same place i've got one underneath east lake sort of ten centimetres down so.
yeah.
that's where mine is.
oh right.
it's underneath the east lake about ten centimetres down from it.
uh-huh.
right.
i'm i'm i'm pos-- right i'm now sort of above the stile to the right.
so where where from here.
you're above the stile to the right.
did you you you went along to the stile and then you went up.
uh-huh.
i went eh along i went along to the right-hand side the stile like you said then went up sort of a few centimetres and along slightly again to the right.
right.
you take a diagonal line down 'til you're underneath the tree.
right.
just straight diagonal down.
i don't know if i should sort of avoid this popular tourist spot or go to it or what you see i'm not eh i'm not sure if the idea is to have a tremendous holiday or.
i don't know.
if the tourist spot's a trap or what.
right i'll just i'll just go along.
down so i'm right underneath the tree.
right.
you go around go round the right-hand side of the tree 'til you're at the top of it.
is it right on top of the tree or just at the right-hand side at the top.
go round the right-hand side the tree.
uh-huh.
and then go along along the the top 'til you're right above it.
right i'm right above it.
right.
now.
take a diagonal line up about two centimetres on quite a steep angle.
eh to the left or right.
to the left.
right.
right.
then.
go straight up to the bottom of the lake.
right well.
i've got a rocket launch pad there which i'll sort of sidestep.
yeah.
so i want to be right underneath the bottom of the lake.
right.
on the sort of right-hand side of the lake.
well.
you're about three three centimetres from the right-hand side of the lake.
oh i shouldn't actually be a-- below the lake no.
you're about three centimetres from the right hand side of the lake.
oh right.
uh-huh that's right i'm.
towards the left-hand side.
yeah yeah that's where i am yeah.
so i just want to go up so i'm underneath the lake.
yeah.
and and the same sort of position.
now.
your lake see the wee bit of the lake know the bottom of the lake stops then it goes up a wee bit before it goes a diagonal.
ehm y-- yeah uh-huh.
do you see that.
yeah.
right.
go straight along the bottom of the lake following it 'til you reach there and then go about two centimetres further and that's the finish.
right so i want to.
there's the bottom the bottom right of the lake.
so in other words i want to sort of follow the shape of the lake.
mmhmm.
follow the shape of the lake until you y-- until like you reach the.
the sort of diagonal bit near the end.
'til you reach the end of the bo--.
know the bottom sort of slopes up and then there's a sharp there's er about a ninety degree angle and it goes north.
uh-huh.
right.
you want to go along to about there and then go another two centimetres following the same line.
so i want to go to the the bottom right-hand corner of the lake to start with.
yeah.
right.
right.
i'm at the bottom right-hand corner of the lake now.
right.
go it's d-- eh go just about a couple of centimetres past that.
eh ab-- abo-- up or to the side.
just on the same a-- the same same way.
right.
the same way as the lake goes.
no.
y--.
the same way you were traveling.
oh eh.
well y-- you don't really know which way i'm traveling i'm sort of traveling i if i was doing it the way i'm traveling i'd be going off to the right.
you want me to go up or to the right or what.
hmm.
ehm.
well i'm at the bottom of the lake.
right.
the bottom right-hand corner of the lake.
do you want me to go two centimetres to the right or do you want me to go up.
oh no.
you're supposed to be at the bottom left-hand side of the lake.
oh the bottom left-hand side.
yeah.
oh right i see wh-- i see what you're doing a bit better now right.
i hopefully allowed to scrub that out.
so i want to go to the bottom oh right sorry there was a bit of a.
no.
it was my mistake i didn't realise you were saying bottom right-hand.
don't know what the what the wha-- what the psychologists'll take from that i don't know right from my left perhaps.
right.
i'm i'm there i'm at the bottom.
so i want to just go up same way the lake's going about two centimetres.
no.
you want go same way you're traveling.
uh-huh right.
just beyond the beyond the bottom of the lake for about two centimetres and that's the finish.
right.
it it should be directly under the left-hand side of the lake.
right i know where you are.
have you read it then.
okey-dokey.
uh-huh.
go south past the diamond mine then hang a left just at the bottom of it.
right go south mm past the diamond hang a left right i'm going left.
how far.
sor-- eh left on the paper towards your and you hang left towards the graveyard.
right.
you're going u--.
graveyard.
no graveyard over here.
yeah.
there should be a wee graveya--.
well as you walk towards it it should be to the right west east sorry.
just tell me what you what it is to you dave and i'll do it for me.
right.
you come down past the diamond mine.
south.
aye you're south.
south.
and then are going.
and then you go east towards the graveyard.
east.
mind you there's no graveyard on mine.
mm.
well you hang hang go east for a bit.
i'll just go east.
'til you're about two thirds of the way across the paper.
mm.
right then.
head head north.
and then hang a right around the carved stones.
over them or above.
above.
mm.
then you go south again.
until you get to the indian country then you do a wee chicane.
turn left above the indian country.
so i'm.
then a wee chicane round and hang a left around the gold mine.
so i'm going round indian country and down to the left then down below the gold mine.
n-- well you underneath the great rock rock then round then over the top of the gold mine.
oh my map's totally different dave.
right.
i've got no great rock.
have you got a gold mine.
aye i've got a gold mine.
right.
so you go round the gold mine then you.
below it or above it.
but what you go round the top of it then hang a left hang south go past it then south.
right i'm going past it here right and then south.
then south.
then you go about prf two thirds three quarters of the way down the page.
three quarters of the way down the page well that's about here right.
then you hang a left.
left.
sorry east go east.
you mean right.
aye.
right is this below the.
mmhmm.
oh well.
right right right so you go along there.
mmhmm.
then you goes northeast.
have you got a trout farm on your map.
aye.
i'm about to if we're going northeast.
you go northeast up to just below the trout farm go along the bottom of it.
you got the cavalry.
no.
no.
i wouldnae think so.
that's the that's the good guys.
er right so.
trout farm you you go jus-- just about just about halfway past it then down south again.
so just up bes-- alongside it.
just past it.
aye just past it right.
then you go south.
go south south away down to.
how can i go south i've just went north past it.
no you don't go north past it ah.
what the hell am i meant to do then.
right.
you're at the trout farm right.
yeah.
i've gone along the bottom.
you're on the bottom.
then you turn a right hang south.
so i reach them you want me to did you go past it just a wee bit and then go down.
and then go south.
yes.
mm.
t-- down towards a cattle stockade.
yeah.
eh you pass the cattle stockade on the east hand side.
right.
then you go west right underneath it.
mmhmm.
and then.
have you got the bandit territory no.
so we're no it's in the left corner.
there's i've got parched river bed in between me and a.
right.
well you go past the stockade then you go you hang a left to have to take it that to avoid the parched river stockade uh parched river on yours.
go underneath that then along the bottom.
so.
i'll m-- i'll miss the parched river bed.
and along the bottom.
underneath the bandit territory.
underneath bandit territory.
then north up to the finish.
up to this.
up to the wee cross.
start north.
mm avoiding the gallows i guess.
that your finish.
that's me finished.
wait a minute i think you've went to the wrong bit.
have you no got a wee cross a wee finishing mark beside your bandit territory.
no.
nope.
okey-dokey right.
we'll go over the map again.
right you comes down.
down.
past the diamond mine.
past the diamond mine.
along.
along.
have you got the graveyard on yours.
no.
well there's a graveyard just past the diamond mine.
if you want to mark that in.
right.
you go east after the diamond mine.
right.
well there's a graveyard just before you go north again.
mmhmm.
mmhmm so there's a wee.
just draw a couple of headstones or something.
there's a wee graveyard there.
then you go up round the carved stones.
right.
up round the carved stones.
and down towards indian country.
down towards.
past the ravine.
right.
there's a great rock in between the indian country and the gold mine.
well there's my great rock's further away it's away somewhere else.
yeah.
there's another there's another great rock.
oh i see.
mmhmm.
it's about the same bearing north as the indian country about midway between the indian country and the gold mine.
right.
that's another.
right.
another wee great rock here.
right you follow it round and you get to the trout farm.
right follow everything round you get to the trout farm right.
right.
i missed the totem pole.
right.
then just after you hang a right well go s--.
south.
go south.
there's a fort cavalry fort.
just after the on which side of the line that i've just drawn down.
underneath the line.
underneath the trout farm.
underneath the trout farm slightly slightly east and underneath it.
between that and this.
and this stockade below it.
yeah.
so that's away.
stockade's directly below it.
then you go round past the cattle stockade.
right.
then you got your parched river bed.
you're in i've got my parched river which i've avoided.
and the bandit territory and your finishing point is pup prrr just just west and slightly above the bandit territory.
oh right so it's there.
just makes a slight.
so all that that you've got going up past the gallows in.
it is rubbish.
everything is just the tourist route.
right so.
you got an extinct volcano.
uh-huh.
right.
you got a cross above it.
uh-huh.
start.
uh-huh.
right.
you have got a tribal settlement down at the left-hand side of your page.
no.
right.
what you're going to do is you're going to from the start you're going to go left and you're going to go down down you know like you're going to go across a bit and down to the bottom of the extinct volcano.
know what i mean.
across.
have you got the machete.
no.
oh right.
have you got the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
right.
where do i go across to.
"right you're just heading down to the left diagonally down to the bottom of the extinct volcano 'til you're about a centimetre left of the ""e"" in extinct volcano."
ah.
okay.
"see your ""e""."
mmhmm.
right.
go along about a centimetre and draw a dot.
to the left.
uh-huh to the left.
"above the ""e""."
no.
oh right.
"b-- just d-- st-- across from the ""e""."
okay.
okay.
just a centimetre and draw a dot.
just about a centimetre and a half.
and draw from your start draw a line from your start down to that dot.
down to it.
uh-huh.
diagonally down.
not across to it.
well it's kind of down 'cause your start's above the extinct volcano.
uh-huh.
okay.
right.
so you've drawn a line down to th-- there.
to where.
to that dot that i've just given you about a centimetre from the extinct volcano.
right.
oh right.
okay.
"what to the left of the ""e""."
uh-huh.
oh right okay.
so you're going down that way and right keep on going down 'til you're about three centimetres from the bottom of the page.
mmhmm.
so i'm in a diagonal at the moment.
uh-huh.
you're to go down like diagonally.
okay.
and we're past we don't go through the old volcano no.
no.
you're just going down the side of the volcano until you're level with the the extinct.
okay.
okay.
okay.
okay.
uh-huh.
right.
diagonally go down towards the left about another two centimetres continue your line for about another two centimetres.
okay.
down.
okay.
so like.
then st--.
okay.
so you're getting towards the bottom of the page.
okay.
right.
now stop.
uh-huh.
right.
now you you sh-- you should be about two or three centimetres from the bottom of the page.
uh-huh.
right.
y-- on my map i've got a tribal settlement along to the left towards the left-hand side of the page.
no i haven't.
and what you're going to do is draw a straight line to the left.
mmhmm.
until you're about three centimetres from the left-hand side of the page.
mmhmm.
okay so just draw a straight line.
until you're about three centimetres.
centimetres from the left-hand side of the page to your left okay.
okay.
then stop.
right okay.
right.
see your rope bridge.
uh-huh.
you're now going to go up the page.
towards your rope bridge and you're going to cross the rope bridge.
mmhmm.
okay.
okay so go s--.
so do i go straight up then.
uh-huh just go straight up.
and veer off to the right to the rope bridge.
you know how you've the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
j-- just just go up as though you're going to.
oh right.
just doing a diagonal again towards it.
uh-huh.
just you're just going up towards your rope bridge.
okay.
and cross it.
and cross it.
and cross it.
okay.
okay.
okay.
right.
now you're at the right-hand side of your rope bridge.
mmhmm.
now can you go diagonally down right for about two centimetres just like diagonally down right not straight down.
oh right okay.
but just diagonally down right.
uh-huh.
for two centimetres.
for two centimetres.
okay.
and stop.
okay.
right.
and then you're going to keep on going right but you're going to go straight for about six centimetres.
have you got a collapsed shelter.
uh-huh.
right.
"just under the ""o"" of the collapsed shelter you're going straight right."
oh right so oh right.
"until you're underneath the ""o"" of the collapsed shelter you're about th-- two centimetres below the ""o"" of the collapsed shelter actually."
is there not a squiggly line there.
'cause i've got a machete in between the rope bridge and the collapsed shelter i couldn't go straight across.
uh-huh.
that's why you're going down.
oh right okay.
see i've taken you down diagonally right and then now you're going straight across right.
oh okay.
see what i mean.
oh no no.
right you've just crossed the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
and instead of going straight across to the collapsed shelter.
uh-huh.
i'm taking you down right and then across.
okay.
"okay i'm taking you down a wee bit down a wee ""u"" shape."
is it not a couple of inches.
aye it's a couple of inches across to the collapsed shelter.
but you're only going down about a couple of er you're only going down about an inch.
i'm going down more than that.
well don't go d--.
just go down.
i think it'll be thing with the machete i think it'll be out of it.
okay.
okay.
then you've gone along right.
uh-huh.
until you're about.
"to the ""o"" of the collapsed shelter."
uh-huh.
"but you're down a-- below the ""o""."
uh-huh okay right.
okay.
okay.
i'll draw in that.
okay.
uh-huh.
right.
"now i want you to go right through the ""o"" of the collapsed shelter."
right through it.
uh-huh.
well you know what i mean you know as though you're going up that way.
uh-huh.
okay.
and i want you to go up there for about three inches.
"what am i oh right am i actually going through the letter ""o""."
uh-huh.
okay right.
so i know exactly where you are.
okay right.
okay.
"go through the ""o"" of the collapsed shelter."
uh-huh.
and go up.
have you got a saxon barn to your left hand side.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
right i want you to go up straight up the page.
mmhmm okay.
until you're ehm horizontally opposite the top of the saxon barn.
right okay.
okay.
okay.
and now you now you're up here.
mmhmm.
now i want you to right you're going to v--.
"see at the ""n"" of the saxon barn."
mmhmm.
right if you want to draw a dot there.
okay.
okay.
that's where you're heading--.
below it directly below it.
directly below it.
uh-huh.
that's where you want to head for.
okay.
but you're going to d-- go d-- like diagonally to it.
okay.
but i want you to go up a tiny wee bit first then go down diagonally to it.
right okay.
'cause i've got a crevasse there.
uh-huh.
so it's like a wee hump.
okay.
okay.
a--.
it's just a like is it a kind of curvy hump.
uh-huh.
okay then.
"you're going up and then you're going down just to underneath this point ""n""."
right okay.
underneath the saxon barn.
okay.
okay.
that'll probably miss your crevasse.
uh-huh.
"right you're underneath the ""n"" of the saxon barn now."
uh-huh.
right.
"just underline saxon barn to the le-- go t-- left until you're underneath the ""s""."
okay.
right okay.
okay.
right have you got a group of pelicans.
no.
right if you think see between this thi-- see how the saxon barn and the rope bridge are above each other.
uh-huh.
well to the left i've got a bunch of pelicans.
right okay.
so do you see what i'm going to.
you've got the white mountain up above the saxon barn.
uh-huh.
"well what we're going to do is we're going down and we're doing a ""u"" shape to miss these pelicans."
okay.
so what you're doing is you're.
are they in a straight are they like horizontal to the saxon barn.
are there they're horizontal to the saxon barn.
uh-huh.
but they're they're th-- they're they're they're down a bit they're in between the saxon barn and the rope bridge if you can think about it.
okay.
see to like to make a triangle see the point of the triangle.
uh-huh.
if you make a triangle from saxon barn to rope bridge at the point and that's where the pelicans are.
see if you join the rope bridge and the saxon barn together.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
and then like you make a triangle out of it.
right okay.
that's where the pelicans are.
okay right okay.
"so you want to draw a ""u"" shape underneath these pelicans."
do you.
so see from where you are at the saxon barn.
uh-huh.
if you go down diagonally left about about an inch and a half.
mmhmm.
okay.
and then you go along for about an inch.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
and then we're going to go straight up to the white mountain.
okay.
"okay so you've made a kind of ""u"" shape."
uh-huh.
to miss these pelicans.
uh-huh.
right.
go straight up 'til you're at the bottom of the white mountain.
okay uh-huh.
and right and see how the white mountain goes up diagonally right.
mmhmm.
pretend you're climbing the top of the white mountain.
so you're climbing up to.
uu-uu.
oh you're climbing up to the top of the white mountain.
okay.
okay.
just.
right up t-- up to the wee peak.
all right just follow it then.

just follow the the route.
okay.
as though you're at now you're at the peak of the white mountain.
uh-huh.
have you got a golden beach.

ehm about three inches.
okay right got you.
just no i d-- i'll tell you what.

mmhmm.
that's as far as i want you to go which is about three inches along to the left.
right okay.
okay.
okay.
then i want you to go along.
oh.
to the right three inches 'til you're at the bottom of your slate mountain.
is that three inch--.
oh i suppose so.
uh-huh.
you know what i mean.
it's about three inches.
yeah.
okay.
now you're at the bottom of your slate mountain.
uh-huh uh-huh.

okay.
okay.
so you're now at the bottom.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
right.
and i want you to come back the way you came to the left underneath the slate mountain.
okay.

i'm sort of up to the to the left of the burnt forest.
uh-huh.
uh-huh that's right.
okay.
right well.
what it is is it's a it's a kind of curved line right but don't draw this i'm just telling you what it is but we just drew a straight line last time it's a curved line from start in this this.
right.
it starts at start.
right.
and it stops just horizontally from ravine but it stops down from start.
mmhmm.
do you know what i mean.
stops horizontally from ravine.
uh-huh.
it's just on line with ravine but it's like just a curvy line and you stop just where you started.
do you know what i mean it doesn't make sense does it.
no.
in fact you just wa--.
so we're stopping d-- below start.
uh-huh.
and to the to the left of ravine.
uh-huh.

just straight down.
straight down.
to a-- th-- there's i've got a carpenter's cottage.
you haven't g-- you aren't going through anything are you.
where.
to the left of the ravine.
so i obviously need to miss that on the left-hand side.
uh-huh miss that.
and just come down to level with the ravine.
uh-huh.
okay.
okay right.
and it's a vertical line yeah.
yeah.
mmhmm okay.
yeah right that's good.
"and then you you draw horizontally just and stop where the ""t"" is of forest."
okay.
forest.
oh right okay.
burnt forest.
so okay fine.
okay.
and then.
"so i'm level with ravine and coming across to to the ""t"" of forest."
uh-huh that's right and then.
okay.
you go up.
so i'm going round the top of the ravine.
uh-huh that's right that's good.
okay.
right.
and then horizontal.
have you got a remote village.
no i don't.
oh right.
no.
right that's right i forgot.
right you know where the seagulls are.

do you know what i mean.
so i'm go-- going a-- across the top of the ravine.
uh-huh.
and down again.
no.
just keep on eh zzz.
ah-- just straight across in a a horizontal across the top of the ravine.
uh-huh that's right.
and stop at the top.
right.
okay.
okay.
and you've not vent-- v-- have you went very far up from the ravine.
no i've just gone over the top of the seagulls.
right that's good that's good.
right and then.
uu-uu.
see you go under this remote village but you've not got it ehm.
so what about the pine g-- pine grove have you got that.
uh-huh.
yeah i've got that.
how.
if i go towards that.
uh-huh.
and is it above the pine grove the remote village.
uh-huh.
whe-- wh--.
it's just above the ravine.
it's just above the ravine.
uh-huh.
so a-- at the moment i'm going underneath it.
uh-huh that's right.
if i've just come across the top of the ravine.
uh-huh.
so i want to head towards the trees.
uh-huh.
the pine grove.
uh-huh.
a--.
okay.
and then whereabouts after that.
you go down until just underneath.
"right see ""p"" of pine grove."
yeah.
just go down.
so i-- i don't i'm going d-- d-- down the left-hand side of pine grove.
uh-huh that's right.
"and to to the ""p""."
uh-huh okay.
"so i want to be right at the ""p""."
well sort of.
right okay.
about a centimetre away from it okay.
right fine okay.
uh-huh right ehm.
where you've got something else haven't you underneath the pine grove.
i've got an avalanche.
uh-huh right well--.
which is a bit over to the right-hand side.
and down.
uh-huh.
right.
yeah.
okay well and you've got the concealed hideout.
yeah i've got that.
well draw a line so you miss out the avalanche.
sti-- am i going round to the right o-- s-- hand side of the avalan-- the concealed hid-- hideout.
ehm right.
where do i want to go in relation to the concealed hideout.
you miss out.
right see in the line.
v-- you miss out you put the concealed hideout to your right and.
no wait a minute wait a minute.
you put the avalanche to the right of your line and the concealed hideout to the left of your line.
so i've got to go down to the top of the concealed hideout and then across to the right.
eh.
that be right.
see it's a curvy line.
i don't know how i could describe this.
but if i if i just go in straight lines to to miss the things.
okay then uh-huh yeah sure.
if i go down to the top of the the concealed hideout and then straight along the top of the concealed hideout.
uh-huh.
is that right.
uh-huh.
okay.
okay.
so i.
and you're missing out.
so i miss the bottom of the avalanche i'm going underneath the avalanche.
right that's good.
okay.
so it's not involved in your line like it's to the right of.
it's to the right of it's to the right of the line yeah.
your line yeah that's good and right.
so draw round the concealed hideout 'cause it's actually in your line you know what i mean it's to the r-- to the left of your line.
do you know what i mean.
so i've got to go i've got to go down past the concealed hideout.
you just draw round it.
just draw a wee kind of circle round it.
yeah right okay.
right.
and then heading.
okay.
do you know where the boat house is.
yeah.
have you got one just.
it's directly below me now it's to the right of the concealed hideout.
eh.
"i'm j-- i'm just i'll tell you where i am i'm at the ""t"" of concealed hideout."
uh-huh.
good good right well i've got two boathouses right.
i think you you've only got one 'cause lynn only had one.
i've got one and it's on the right-hand side of the page.
ehm which.
is it just below concealed hideout.
"it's it's directly it's it's directly below the ""t"" of concealed hideout."
quite a bit down.
ehm not that far it's about wh-- i don't know.
how many.
four or five centimetres five centimetres maybe.
right okay.
well i've got another one.
right.
i've got one that's ehm.
right.
it's to the left of the concealed hideout about a centimetre down.
okay.
so.
and it's like ehm.
is it in the curvy bay bit.
in the what.
see the curvy bay see where it says crane bay and there's a big curve.
uh-huh.
is it in that bit.
no it's up it's.
right.
it's just on the same level as the concealed hideout.
it's on the same level.
same well kind of it's just like a centimetre down.
below.
right okay i think.
okay.
okay.
right.
so what you do is right you know how you've got crane bay.
uh-huh.
and you know how you've got the first right you start off from your right okay and you've.
know how you've got that first kind of bump.
no.
the of the bay.
right.
i tell you what i.
mmhmm.
the corner of the bay.
uh-huh.
see if i go down to the bay.
uh-huh.
and just go along the shore will i miss everything.
right i'll tell you what right.
"you're und-- you're under ""t"" just now."
"yeah i'm just at ""t"" uh-huh."
okay.
yeah.
"well right see the ""b"" of bay."
"the ""b"" of bay."
uh-huh.
okay.
right.
go up right just go underne-- oh right.
"head for ""b"" of bee-- bay."
no no no no no no no no.
oh.
right ehm.
go underneath the word concealed bay just draw a horizontal line underneath it.
okay.
concealed.
bay.
oh concealed hideout.
conc-- hideout uh-huh.
right.
okay.
okay.
right.
do a straight line.
right.
okay.
and then draw ehm go over another two centimetres.
okay.
okay.
and stop.
one two right okay.
okay.
"and then go right down and you should be like vertical with b-- the ""b"" of bay."
right that's yeah that's where i.
"am okay right so i'm coming straight straight down to the ""b"" of."
oh that's great that's great.
uh-huh.
bay right okay.
but not go through not go uu-uu.
right.
i've just got it coming down to the edge of the lake.
uh-huh.
right okay.
lake.
or the the sea or whatever it is at the bottom.
oh right okay.
right.
you know that wee curve.
uh-huh.
just draw round it.
right.
okay.
you're a-- maybe about a half a centimetre above it.
i'm goi-- going over to the left now.
uh-huh.
right.
that's right.
have you got a coconut palm.
no.
ah sugar.
you've got the pebbled bay ehm.
pebbled shore.
pebbled shore pe--.
i've got bay on the brain.
right ehm.
what you could do is ehm.
i want to go to the tilled land that looks quite cool.
the what.
the tilled land.
have you got tilled land it's away up the top somewhere.
oh right.
it's just totally out of nowhere.
woo.
right.
what you could do is you could just follow.
right.
go a-- you know your bump know how i've told you to draw that curve.
y-- yeah uh-huh.
"there's a bump just a-- a-- above ""c""."
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
right.
okay.
right.
just draw round it.
draw round that okay.
uh-huh.
until you come parallel to the pebbled shore.
'til i come down to the pebbled shore.
uh-huh.
okay.
okay.
and then draw a horizontal line.
so i might go under pebbled shore.
no no.
above it.
above it.
draw a horizontal line above it.
right.
okay.
okay.
you've also got something underneath the pebbled shore haven't you.
yeah i've got i've got washed stones.
wow.
goodness knows what they are.
lucky you.
uh.
mm.
well.
oh no.
right ehm.
ouch.
you g-- i would suppose that you go round them.
right where the finish is is just.
know the flagship.
yeah.
well you know the windows of the flagship.
yeah.
ehm it's like.
level with them.
level with them.
good word thank you.
on the shore below b-- is it below a-- any of the letters in pebbled shore.
"like the ""p"" maybe."
"ehm it's underneath the uh-huh the ""p"" or the it's underneath the the ""e"" and the ""b""."
aye i'm going to just.
so that's where the finish is.
"going to d-- i'm just going to dodge this i'm going to do a wee ""s"" round here."
right.
okay.
and go down to the.
you go but don't right.
see your washed stones.
uh-huh.
ha ha.
yeah er.
put them to the ehm oh to the thingy the right of the line.
to the right of the line.
uh-huh.
right i'll do it.
i'll go back up then and go round them.
okay and go.
right.
round the pebbled shore.
and go round what.
the pebbled shore as well.
i've go-- i've gone round that uh-huh.
uh-huh.
yeah yeah.
but you go round your washed stones.
washed stones.
right.
"""e"" they should be to the right."
okay.
so you should have like you take a wide line.
do you know what i mean.
yeah i-- yeah i've got it uh-huh.
have you got a wide line.
yeah.
yeah uh-huh.
well i've i've done a wee chink because i went the wrong way i'm just just about yeah i don't know where the finish is but i think it's about here.
yeah are you at finish.
uh-huh.
right.
you're a-- maybe about two centimetres above the page.
yeah uh-huh that's that's okay yeah.
oh that's great.
and you've done a wide line.
yeah got it.
right okay.
mmhmm.
that's it.
we're there.
we've finished.
uh-huh that's it finished.
we're starting er down by the bottom left-hand corner down near the bottom left-hand corner just above it.
there's a yeah.
p-- above a site of a forest fire.
above it ab--.
above the site of a forest fire.
go west jus-- just to the almost the side of the paper then south down to near the bottom of the paper where there's a picnic site.
you have one there.
picnic site.
how far off the bottom of the paper.
er about an inch.
you go you just go west and down to about an inch off the bottom of the paper.
and then you go along to the you go east about.
to about an inch off the bottom.
inch off the bottom.
and when you go east you go in a-- in about three inches.
do you have an adventure playground.
yeah.
right.
you go up you go south i mean you go north up past it on the on its right its left-hand side.
so i'm just going to be going past the site of the forest fire.
it's just about just below it just below.
it on my map.
until just below.
so you just go past the adventure playground on the its left-hand side.
and no more aye.
and no more.
and then you just.
right.
you go east across the paper slight-- a slight angle uh just about five degrees above east across the paper to about until you're about th-- three quarters of the way across the paper there shouldn't be anything there.
well there's nothing here.
i've got a privately owned fields there.
privately owned fields start about halfway across the paper about a quarter of the way up.
mmhmm well.
so if i go right that sort of the way go i'm going to come right across the privately owned fields.
we could go east below it directly east.
right the way across the paper.
mmhmm.
right.
east below it to about two thirds of the way across the paper.
we'd need to go a bit further than that if possible.
bit further.
right okay.
right.
right your next should be going north.
yeah.
up where there's a.
have you a granite quarry.
yeah.
it's ab-- it's about s-- just off the centre of the page.
yeah.
just slightly above it.
you go up north and you curve round the top of it.
so north.
until where.
until erm.
well you go up pa-- you go up and round it you go north and you keep going round you sort when you get to about the word granite quarry on y-- y-- on your right-hand side of the granite quarry you are you start curving around it over the top of it.
i'll be about an inch and a half off granite quarry when i start curving.
right.
and i've got a waterfall to the left of the granite quarry.
i've got a waterfall as well.
so you want to go round it.
"well you curve right round it and then down so it's like a ""u""-shape curve you curve round and down over the top of the granite quarry."
round.
right.
and then.
to the bottom of the waterfall.
and a bit below.
there i've got a train.
have you got a train crossing.
no.
no no.
right.
i'm going round the top of the granite quarry to about below the level of the waterfall.
quarry.
and.
below yeah about an inch below the the word waterfall.
and you s-- s-- just before you get to there you sort of square off a bit.
you go start going west.
right.
i'm going west.
and then you cu-- you sort of curve round it just slightly and up past north past the waterfall.
so am i going out.
i'm about an inch.
just past the waterfall.
i'm about an inch.
the top of the waterfall.
and a half to the right of the paper the edge of the paper.
yeah i'm.
about two inches.
and i'm about er about a centimetre above the waterfall.
right.
you you go ea-- east just past the waterfall on the east hand side.
right east.
across the top of it.
i've got a public footpath.
right.
then you're going north.
uh right.
you miss it by about two inches then you go.
have you got cornfields at the top of the page.
yeah.
"you go along to about the word the letter ""n"" below the cornfields."
how far below them should i be about an inch.
er about an inch and a half somewhere around there.
er and then you you cut down about er southeast across the page.
to where lion country.
down to the er ha-- no.
have you got fallen cairn.
yeah.
now you.
which is about a third no it's hawe-- almost halfway down the page.
yeah.
and er well you cut down to below it you curve right you cut down to it and go below it.
right.
just so you're going southeast.
so you're going so that's just to where the east of where i went beyond the quarry.
yeah.
yeah.
it's just ab-- er fallen cairn's just above the quarry and to the right.
yeah.
yeah.
you just cut down to that then go down to the bot-- round the bottom of it.
so i'm below the fallen cairn.
yeah.
so you go past it at the bottom.
i'm about an inch yeah about an inch below i am.
mm.
you go east past it.
a bit lower.
you go ju-- i mean you jus-- you start cu-- actually curve right round it so you cu-- just like in a wee.
right.
so i go round it.
so you go back up over your line you go back round just almost parallel to the one you drew to come down to it.
i see past.
i've got lion country.
uh-huh.
just about.
i've got limestone cliffs.
you see east lake.
yeah.
it's below no you've got the bottom right-hand tip.
mmhmm.
and then about halfway along that you've got a wee knobbly bit and just below that about two inches below that i've got lion country so if i come back up along the line i'm going to go right across lion country.
right.
i've got lime stone cliffs which is the bottom right-hand corner of east lake it's below that right directly below it.
mm.
er so you've gone round fallen cairn.
where've you got you've you've got to.
i'm just er i'm just to the right of fallen cairn directly on the top stone about couple of centimetres to the right.
that's right.
mmhmm.
and you want to m-- and you've got to miss lion country.
yeah.
well you're fffffff.
well if a-- am i trying to get back up to where i started below the cornfields.
y-- you're trying to get up back up to the finish which is just between the cornfields and east lake.
there's a finish just there.
just between them.
it's the bottom corner the bottom left-hand corner of east lake.
yeah.
it's about an inch to the on parallel wi-- on a a line with that but about an inch to the east west.
and so i want to go to about there.
so.
and that should be about almost halfway across your page.
and you go just about parallel to the line before.
to that to that line.
and then a cut up north past the the limestone cliffs and then skirt part of east lake to the finish.
so.
from fallen cairn you want me to go north.
you want to get north somehow.
up to about.
yeah i can do that.
"i start going parallel along i mean skirting along east lake about the line comes up to about the ""a"" below the ""a"" and where the east lake's written."
and then go p-- i skirt along the lake to the finish.
yeah.
s-- so north up to the bottom right-hand corner of east lake if i can do that yeah.
"mm up to about the ""k"" whenever you can get there."
so right.
i'm not going through the lion country that way so it's just off north for me.
right.
"i'm at just below the ""k"" and i skirt along east lake."
uh skirt along east lake to the finish which is just.
just.
right.
mm.
right okay.
have you got the start up at the top left-hand corner.
uh-huh.
to the left of the burnt forest.
yeah.
right okay ehm right.
you're going to start coming down but a-- but as you come down you're c-- you curve to the right.
to the right.
uh-huh.
bel-- just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt forest.
besi--.
right.
how far.
right.
you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below s-- directly below start.
uh-huh.
understand what i mean.
so it's not going to it's n-- it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve.
have you not got.
have you not got the carpenter's cottage.
no.
how f-- how far below the burnt forest do i go.
do i go right along the beneath it before i curve.
no you just see how.
i just go past it.
uh-huh you just.
so it's only a slight curve.
uh-huh it's just a slight curve.
to the right and then back to the left.
uh-huh and then back to the left.
right uh-huh.
okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then.
directly underneath.
mm.
mmhmm.
right okay.
so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right.
have you got the ravine.
uh-huh.
right.
going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine.
below it.
uh-huh.
then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine.
right so.
i go along to the right.
mmhmm.
until i'm about an inch below the ravine but to the left of it.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
and then i go up past the left-hand side of it.
uh-huh.
right.
do you have the remote village.
no.
right.
well it doesn't doesn't matter.
i'm now at the top left-hand side of the ravine.
uh-huh.
you can go about a centimetre above the rav-- the ravine.
okay.
and then.
still to the left of it.
uh-huh uh-huh.
uh-huh.
and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line.
have you got the pine grove.
uh-huh.
okay.
bef-- so don't go as far as the pine grove.
mmhmm.
right.
so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up.
right.
but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet.
okay.
so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove.
you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove.
i'm not making this very easy am i right.
okay.
mmhmm.
see what i mean.
uh-huh.
so you go down until you're a-- ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove.
bottom left-hand corner.
mmhmm.
but not ehm touching it or.
no not touching.
right.
okay.
uh-huh.
right right.
have you got the concealed hideout.
uh-huh.
i've got an avalanche above it though.
oh right.
okay ehm.
directly above the concealed hideout.
uh-huh.
okay well.
i haven't got that.
but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right.
mmhmm.
okay.
moving down all the time.
along wha-- what along the bottom of the pine grove or going past it.
you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're g-- you're n--.
towards the concealed hideout.
uh-huh.
where do i end up in relation to the concealed hideout.
right.
what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve r-- to the right again acro-- along the top of this concealed hideout.
but i d-- i don't go along the bottom of the pine grove.
no.
so it's not much of a curve.
no.
right eh.
and i end up to the left of the concealed hideout.
no.
you're going you're going to go to the right of the concealed hideout you're going to go along the top to the right.
along the top of it.
right.
mmhmm.
okay.
'til you've sort of curved to the right then to the left and then back out to the right again.
mmhmm.
uh-huh.
no.
but i haven't hit anything so.
right okay.
ehm right.
so you're u-- a-- where are you now then.
i'm to the right of the concealed hideout.
okay.
right ehm you--.
have you got the boat house.
uh-huh.
right.
what you're going to do is you're going to curve round the concealed hideout going round the right of it and then straight along until you get to the boat house the bottom left-hand corner of the boat house.
left.
no.
bottom right-hand corner of the boat house.
okay.
right.
okay right.
have you got the crane bay.
uh-huh.
right y--.
you're going to go straight down perpen-- eh straight down to the crane bay.
and to the right of the boat house.
uh-huh.
right well.
the boat house is sort of on crane bay beside it.
oh is it.
uh-huh.
oh you've got a different boat house i've got two boat houses.
you've got two.
uh-huh.
so we've made a mistake you shou--.
well.
which w-- which.
right okay you.
see my boat house is to the left of the concealed hideout.
well.
mine's to the right and below it.
right okay sorry.
that's the wrong one.
you don't wanna go anywhere near that one.
right.
right.
"so will i do a ""u""-turn."
uh-huh.
just just scrub that bit out then and go back up to the concealed hideout.
okay.
right so.
le-- so v-- we'll say we're at the bottom right-hand corner of the concealed hideout.
bottom right.
mmhmm.
uh-huh.
right okay.
mmhmm.
right.
you're going to go in a straight line along the left of the page.
okay.
the left.
to to the left of the page.
not not right along i mean it in a l-- i mean in a left direction.
towards the.
you mean.
under the concealed hideout.
mmhmm.
u-- under that a-- uh-huh al--.
right.
i'm going along under the i'm now at the bottom left-hand corner of the the concealed hideout right.
right.
don't go right do--.
right.
you can go a bit further about another inch.
right.
okay.
now right.
look down to the crane bay right.
uh-huh.
ehm s-- straight down from that have you got an actual wee bay there like curves.
hmm.
straight down from where.
from where you are at the moment.
uh-huh uh-huh.
right.
so we'll go straight down then straight down and don't hit the bay but f-- but follow that curve in the bay so you're going to go straight down south.
mmhmm.
okay.
mmhmm.
have you done that then.
eh uh-huh.
right.
well.
i mean i will have in a minute once i see where you're going.
right.
have you got the coconut palm.
no.
hmm.
have you got the pebbled shore.
uh-huh.
which is where is it on your map.
it's good bit further down opposite the other boat house but further down.
oh you've got another boat house.
ah you still i still don't know where your boat house is.
uh-huh but y-- right have.
oh god right.
where are you now again.
i'm right crane bay there's two sort of little inlets in it at the top of it.
mmhmm.
"above bay and above the ""c"" of crane right."
mmhmm.
see where i mean.
right.
and eh i'm just above that bit of land in between there the curved bit of land.
right that's perfect.
right.
so you're going to come down and follow that wee curve.
mmhmm.
right.
which direction.
to the left.
right.
straight down and then left.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
okay so.
"you're you're sort of on on the corner on the bit that juts out now above the ""c"" of crane."
right.
is that right.
uh-huh.
right now.
right.
what you're going to do now is moving down all the time but you're you're not going to follow the coastline as much you're going to m-- slightly move away from it.
mmhmm.
okay f--.
eh but going down at the same time so down about an inch and a half.
towards the pebbled shore.
uh-huh.
directl-- straight towards it.
ehm uh-huh yes more.
or less but don't go as far as that.
mmhmm.
okay.
'cause you're going to go you're about an a centimetre above the pebbled shore and you're going to go along the top of the pebbled shore.
mmhmm.
moving eh left.
mmhmm.
okay.
then so.
you're about so once right where are you now.
i'm above the pebbled shore to the left of it.
right okay.
move you're going to move to the left but moving down at the same time.
mmhmm.
okay.
until you unti-- for about two or three inches until you're about a centimetre from the left-hand side of the page.
right.
have you got washed stones at all.
no.
okay.
am i below the pebbled shore.
where are your s--.
uh-huh.
you should be about a couple of inches below it but not directly under it.
to the left of it.
uh-huh.
and eh.
a good bit to the left of it.
beside the left-hand side of the page.
uh-huh.
right.
okay.
where's your stones.
mmhmm.
just to just beside me just to the right of me now.
right.
okay.
well you're going to curve round them.
right.
have you got the flagship.
uh-huh.
and the bit and the bit of land that juts out well and the bit that's.
the eh the bay bit that the flagship's in.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
mmhmm.
right.
so what you're going to is curve round your stones there and your the finish is just ehm about a centimetre from that black line that's marking the crane bay ac-- just acro-- directly across from the ship.
okay.
okay there you go.
right.
aye.
right you start at the top left.
uh-huh.
right.
eh right.
"right you've got cliffs to the right so you sort of slope down towards the ""c"" of cliffs."
mmhmm.
right.
and then underneath the you don't have a forge underneath the cliff what is there nothing.
just says sandstone cliffs.
oh.
oh.
right well go right.
right.
are they quite big right are the sandstone s-- cliffs beside the old pine tree.
uh-huh.
right okay.
above it to the left.
ah the cliffs right okay right okay.
right.
right see underneath the cliffs on my map there's a forge.
right.
right.
and that's directly underneath the cliffs so it if.
so i go below that and round underneath the bottom of the pine tree.
yeah.
so just pretend there's a a forge.
right.
but it's like but to the left of the pine tree and below the cliffs right so it's like a loop.
mmhmm.
okay.
so you're ending up just like to the left of the old pine tree.
"i'm directly under the ""b"" of green bay."
up here.
oh it's upside down.
my crane bay's at the bottom right.
green bay i s-- green bay i said.
i haven't got one.
oh.
right okay then right.
i'm below the old pine.
well that's fine.
right.
so just go up round the top of the old pine and stop at the top of it.
right.
and then eh make the line go across page you know to the right.
mmhmm.
about that much.
right.
just straight across.
how sorry about.
that's right two or three centimetres.
right.
right.
then have you got a pine forest on the right.
uh-huh.
yeah.
uh-huh.
right.
"slope down towards the ""p"" of pine forest."
towar-- i don't go round it i've i i don't go above it.
no no.
just keep the pine forest at it outwith it.
right.
right.
and then below that what've you got.
a forest stream.
right so you.
right i haven't got a forest stream right so.
right i've got a bakery.
uh-huh.
right.
"so like you've got to eventually right see from the ""p"" of the pine forest you're going to go out in a sort of wee lump like a nose."
round the bakery.
no.
but right first before you come to the bakery do another wee lump.
why.
'cause i say.
away what am i avoiding.
nothing.
just that's where the route goes.
right okay.
so you do a wee lump and then that comes in just maybe above the wee shed in the bakery.
see where the shed is in the bakery right.
right yeah that's right.
uh-huh.
then you do a big nose round the bakery right right underneath the bakery.
right.
right.
and you don't stop underneath the bakery you continue in for another two centimetres.
right.
right.
right.
right i've got a canal there.
have you.
right.
no.
right okay.
right see after your two centimetres you should be above.
have you got crane bay.
uh-huh.
"above the ""e"" in crane bay."
oh well i'm miles above that right.
right.
right.
right.
"so you go down towards ""e""."
right.
down to the coast.
right.
then you follow the coastline round.
how far.
just eh about two centimetres.
right.
towards there's a sort of a wee and then then then the bay starts sloping down.
mmhmm.
vertically right just about where about where it slopes down.
mmhmm.
right.
and then eh have you got wheatfields to the left of that.
dead high up to the left.
no.
"sort of in line with the ""n"" and the ""e"" of crane bay."
no.
oh right okay.
well i have right.
so just go down.
have you got a w-- rocket warehouse.
uh-huh.
"right go slope down and then above right you slope down to maybe two centimetres above the rocket warehouse and two centimetres in from the bay just say in line with the ""c""."
oh right.
right a wee diagonal line there.
and then you go horizontally across the top of the rocket warehouse.
right.
to just to the edge of the rocket warehouse.
and then you slope the line down onto the edge of the page about s-- five centimetres up from the bottom.
miss do you mean above the cave.
i don't have a cave.
right.
right.
right.
so like.
right to the edge.
well almost.
right.
right.
and then you go down go down the edge of the page right.
the last guy had a cave as well but he went round the bottom of it.
right.
so like just go round the bottom of the cave and then up to the old lighthouse end up at the old lighthouse.

yo-- no you shouldn't be as far up as that.
yeah.
but if i'm going up to my left from half halfway up the page surely i mean am am i supposed to be halfway up the page.
i'll tell you when i am i'm not there yet.
right.

okay.
my line's just straight up and down at the moment.
so i go left for how f-- how f-- far how far left.
i mean d-- do i go beneath the antelopes i mean i i don't mean right beneath them but in underneath er you know in line with them no.
right.
see if you g-- if you put your finger at the antelopes and go straight down.
right.
mmhmm.

mmhmm.
instead of going up towards.
where it says lake.
uh-huh.

right.
now eh.
go down about the same distance to directly south below the starting point at about just below the level of the carpenter's house so from the haystack go down to directly below the starting cross to a level just below the carpenter's house.
where it says carpenter.
well across from that directly below the start.
mmhmm.
so it's going to be in a southwesterly direction.
avoiding the blacksmith.
what blacksmith.
right.
there's a blacksmith next to the carpenter on the left-hand side of it.
right.
i see right.
eh take the line towards well along horizontally to eh.
the carpenter's got a couple of stiles.
yes.
and dykes.
just take it about oh i don't know about a couple of centimetres to the bottom you know a couple of cen-- eh about an inch.
an inch.
no not even an inch about half an inch.
take it horizontally which takes you about oh about an inch and a half away from the carpenters just below where the carpenter is.
at the stiles just at the stiles.
just below the stiles below.
take it down a centimetre and across a centimetre from the last stile to the left horizontally.
okay.
right and that.
have you got that.
yes.
right eh.
you've got green bay at the top.
see green bay.
no no green bay.
no green bay.
well eh.
in a northwesterly direction northeasterly direction sorry and you want a line about oh one two hchchch i would take it maybe two and a half inches northwest avoiding the carpenter's house all the way up so you want a north w-- easterly direction about dwrlr thirty five to forty degrees just below forty-five.
for how many inches.
for about two and a half inches.
right eh.
eh about two inches to the slightly below east next you want to go east about s-- just below east for about two inches.
over towards the the seven beeches.
over towards the seven beeches.
and you want to finish up about an inch high and about oh three quarters of an inch to the left of the seven beeches.
okay.
eh.
right.
you want to come past the seven beeches.
have you got the chapel.
no.
you've not got a chapel.
just below well you want to come down aloalo let me see south just off south the same about the same you know how you came below east you want the same to the east of south about the same sort of about five degrees off basically.
right mmhmm.
to.
so slightly southeast.
slightly southeast.
about five degrees southeast.
mmhmm.
and you want to come across you want to come down about two inches again just below where it says eh seven beeches.
right.
well that'll be about a centimetre below the beech trees.
mmhmm.
"so finish up next to the ""s"" of seven."
basically yes.
okay.
"right on my drawing i've got a chapel that's about an inch long on the on the map it starts directly below the ""s"" and eh."
"we've got to go round this in sort of a circular direction you're going to be moving east and then back and finishing about under the second beech tree the right-hand beech tree so you want to what you want to do is you're going down about two inches again but you've got a eh a net move east of about an inch so from the ""s"" you've got about two inches down and one inch two inches south and about one inch east and you want to come round eh about about one inch one inch east and one inch south and do a curve."
curve that one.
right curve it.
and then you want to go in a southwest of there like direction until you meet the eh the what i ini-- what i init-- ini-- i initially said.
okay.
this is complicated.
how about.
but what your point your initial point mark a point two inches south one inch east of the where you stopped the last time.
uh-huh.
okay have you done that yes.
yes.
eh to get the curve i would go one inch down from where your your point is just now and.
one inch south.
one inch south.
and one inch east and now you want to do a curve from your initial point to that point then down to the two inch.
then then straight down to the two inch mark.
no.
it's southwest er about five ten degrees off south to the southwest to finish under the beech tree the the right-hand beech tree.
going southwest.
going southwest.
to finish under the second beech tree i would have to go southeast if i only moved over one inch to the east in the first movement because you said two inches.
t--.
well make it one and a half inch sorry one and a half inch east.
what's one and a half.
you what you want to do is you want to clear the eh first movement round the chapel will have to clear the beech trees and then come down again to under the first ts on the right-hand beech tree.
right.
i'll try and describe it to you what i think.
"i've come down from to the ""s"" i'm at the ""s"" just now."
right.
of seven i'll continue down but curving round to my right.
yeah.
okay until i've done a quarter curve a quarter of a circle.
that's right yeah.
and that should be just on the level of the the very end of the wee leaves on the beech trees.
ah in mine that's far more than an inch.
well i'll wait to do it until the end then.
right that's okay right i know that n--.
and now i can head back.
right.
s-- in a s-- southeasterly direction to.
see what southwesterly aye.
southwesterly to the point below this trunk of the second beech tree.
oh that's right yeah.
right i'll draw that then.
right.
do you have reclaimed fields.
yes.
so eh.
you'll be wanting to go.
it's about an inch and a half to two inches below where i am just now.
about an inch and a half to two inches below where you are the now.
the reclaimed fields.
mmhmm.
aye see er.
well what you want to do here is you want to go round it in a sort of tube like f-- form like a test tube you want to do a test tube round it.
so you want to go well you're two inches down eh.
will i go down continuing the same gradient i'm on will i go down 'til i'm just above the reclaimed fields.
well you've got.
what have you got reclaimed fields and then sort of soiled ground to the right-hand side of it.
eh there's nothing to the right-hand side.
on the left-hand side there's a whitewashed cottage.
whitewashed cot--.
on the right-hand side.
on the left-hand side.
left-hand side whitewashed.
eh well.
we're going we're going to go round the right-hand side of it.
right.
okay.
so you want to come.
do you have crane bay.
yes.
well what my map does it does this test tube thing round the reclaimed fields then it heads south towards the.
you've got a lower right-hand tip and then you've got two tips off crane bay on the right-hand side which are just about on the same level.
"can you see that just above the ""b"" of crane bay."
so i want to come round the c-- reclaimed fields and you're heading west and then you head south and you follow the line of crane bay.
yeah.
right okay.
so will i move down to nearer reclaimed fields.
move down to nearer reclaimed fields.
go round it.
right right d-- un--.
under what letter will i finish the test tube shape.
"eh just past the ""r"" just past the the drawing of the reclaimed fields."
that that would be me right over at the whitewashed cottage then next to that.
just to the left-hand side.
well don't go that far then come about an inch before it.
right.
"and it's that'll be about under the the ""c"" of reclaimed."
okay that'll f-- do fine yes.
right.
have you got that.
uh-huh.
"well just below that south of that there's a point just above the ""b"" of crane bay."
mmhmm.
like a wee sort of an.
a wee bay bit in it.
a wee point.
there's a sm-- a smiley face and then there's a.
there's no smiley face.
see if you want to come due south to that point and then follow the coast a bit.
follow the coast to where.
follow the coast round eh.
you've got it does a curve and then it meets a point then it goes just about south crane bay it's got a curve and then it goes due south.
can you see that.
mmhmm.
i've got a meadow to the left of that due south pee.
porashin.
a vast meadow.
a vast meadow.
i've got a vast meadow up just below the blacksmiths and carpenters.
well is that huge big and there's nothing at all in that space.
uh-huh.
except a vast meadow.
about halfway up the page.
about halfway up the page it's empty on mine.
well you want to well anyway follow crane bay round the curve.
mmhmm.
goes going going.
following the contour more or less.
going west following the contour.
until you meet just where you stop going west.
and we head south we head southwest there coming out you see it goes you go just about due south then it finishes it's about an inch and a half long.
uh-huh.
and just where it finishes there come about you want to be about an inch to the west of that where you where you stop after going southwest.
so it's south on the actual crane bay then it's about an inch and a half going south.
yeah.
and then about an inch going west.
that's right.
just about a centimetre above.
the west tip.
the west hand.
yeah.
right.
okay.
now have you got attractive cliffs there.
yes.
mmhmm.
and you want to follow across the top of them west.
across the top.
west.
just below i've got a vast meadow there.
mmhmm.
right.
where will i stop that line abo-- across the top.
eh about a centimetre after attract-- attractive cliffs.
right.
you want to go down about ten degrees off south southwest.
mm about a hundred and ninety degrees.
about eh aye.
about a hundred and ninety-five i would say.
okay.
towards crashed spaceship.
i've not got crashed spaceship er spaceship.
and that's that's.
do you have the chestnut tree.
yeah i've got the chestnut tree.
that's my f-- your finishing point.
eh well.
i've got a crashed spaceship.
the right the the straight distance between attractive cliffs and chestnut tree about half of that distance between them in a straight line and then two inches over to the west.
that's just about on the edge of the page.
uh-huh.
yeah.
there's a crashed spaceship.
we're assuming that the top of the map is north.
i would imagine right.
yes.
right.
so where will i go now.
s-- so where are you at bottom of the attractive cliffs.
no.
i'm at the top.
the top.
well you want one nine five.
right.
to where.
to the bottom of the attractive cliffs just about ah about a centimetre below the attractive cliffs.
right.
eh you've got a space craft about here.
about a.
how far from the edge of the page.
well the s-- i just now i'm an inch to the an inch east ah no a centimetre east of the crashed spaceship and at the very top of it.
well eh.
so can you come below it.
you're going to have to come below it yes.
or can you go round the top.
oh i can come straight down past the side of it i can come south just now if i want to.
s-- can you come south and then come slightly west then south again or can you go s-- we-- can you go west just now then south and then east to the finish.
i can't go i can't go west just now really.
you can't go west.
take it a bit more southwest until you're below it.
uh-huh.
i could go i could go west past the top of it if you wanted to right over to the edge of the page.
well do that yeah do that.
and you want to go south when you get about half a centimetre to the edge of the page.
right.
until the bottom of the chestnut tree.
in the very bottom.
the very bottom of the chestnut tree.
right.
ba-- but above the words chestnut tree.
yeah.
the bottom of the trunk of the chestnut tree.
mmhmm.
and then you want to go east along the line of the bottom of the chestnut tree to about oh half an inch away from the bottom.
right.
and then you want to go up to the the mid portion of the chestnut tree to finish just below where the the f-- eh the leaf-line starts.
over at the tree itself.
well you're about half an inch away from it.
so.
"i'm here just now above the ""c"" of chestnut."
yeah.
you want to go up like about.
due north.
due north about half just where the wee bump in the tree is.
right.
and that's your finish with a big cross.
right.
there's no finish point marked on this.
yeah.
there's your big cross.
right.
right neil.
okay right.
where are we going.
start.
where am i starting.
oh right i've got it yeah i've found the start.
have you got the start just above.
yeah i've found it uh-huh.
have you got a camera shop below it no.
yes.
you have.
yes.
right a camera shop.
right.
head due south from that just down for about twelve centimetres.
have you got a parked van at the bottom.
so wait a minute i've got to go round the i've got.
go round.
round the.
go round the left hand side of the camera shop in between the edge of the page and the camera shop.
left-hand side of the camera shop right.
right.
right.
i don't have a parked van at the bottom.
you don't have a parked van.
well go down aim towards the bottom and s-- stay about two centimetres up from the bottom of the page.
right.
i've got a yacht club on the far right-hand side.
a yacht club.
right.
so you go down to just bel--.
see where the the words yacht club are.
uh-huh.
just go sort of go down towards the bottom of the page and draw a line towards the yacht club for about three centimetres underneath where the if you drew a line right across the bottom of the page it wo-- the line would end up under yacht club.
right do you see what i'm.
are we doing that under ya--.
so i want to go down.
no.
don't g-- don't go along to the yacht club though.
but i want to go straight down to there.
right.
"you go down the side of the camera shop right for about twelve centimetres and do a sort of a ""u"" shape for and the bottom of the ""u"" shape should be about three centimetres long."
right do you know what i'm meaning.
three centimetres long.
right.
and a-- a-- what i'm doing it at yacht club i'm going i'm going.
no do-- all right okay.
i'm going i'm going right i'm going right towards the yacht club.
we'll we'll forg--.
we'll forget about the yacht club just now.
no but but that's how far down i want to come.
yeah uh-huh uh-huh.
down towards aye where the yacht club is right.
right.
right okay.
but forget the yacht club 'cause you're nowhere near that you're at the other side of the page.
right i know that yeah.
right.
eh so we're going down it's now you do.
so i take it i'm trying to miss a parked van that's at the bottom of the page here.
right uh-huh.
there's a parked van.
right.
and you're sort of you're sort of.
you've worked it out already.
i've got it.
"eh we're doing a ""u"" shape round the parked van but it's a sort of three cent-- see if you imagine a ""u"" right the stems of the ""u"" the vertical bits are sort of three centimetres between."
see if i go right down if i go right down the bottom and turn right will i miss it.
yes.
right okay i'll.
aye.
right go right down to the bottom.
right.
turn right for three centimetres.
okay.
right.
three or four centimetres.
okay.
right.
now you're heading back up sort of two thir--.
have you got allotments.
allotments.
yeah.
right.
you're going up to the sort of left-hand top left-hand side of the allotments.
right.
from the bottom.
right.
that should be a di-- a straight line up the way.
right okay.
okay.
i'll come along a wee bit just so i can make sure i miss that right okay.
right okay.
"so you've got a sort of ""u"" shape so far except it only."
right okay right.
right okay.
got it.
mm.
you're up at the top f-- left-hand side of the allotments okay.
fine.
now see your yacht club.
yeah.
eh go to the left-hand side of the yacht club and up about f-- six centimetres.
right.
right.
so i've got to go underneath the flight museum.
have you got that.
no.
i've not got a flight museum right.
right.
so i've got.
so you're you're going diagonally sort of north northeast it's not it's it's a sort of two o'clock almost three o'clock from the allotments over.
what side of the allotments am i at am i at the left-hand side of the allot--.
you're at the top.
the left-hand side top.
right okay.
right.
so you're going over the top of the allotments right now.
and down to the yacht club.
eh no no.
down to.
you're up you're going up sort of two o'clock in between two o'clock and three o'clock.
right.
you're going up the way to the see if you draw a line up the left-hand side of the yacht club right the way up the page.
oh right okay.
right.
so i'm going.
you're only going about i would say about two centimetres up from the allotments if you know what i mean.
do you see what i mean.
two centimetres up from the allotments.
but you're.
up from the allotments but along about twelve centimetres.
okay.
oh my god.
right are we starting.
can we do it in straight lines.
right sta-- aye right see.
'cause straight.
you're at the top left-hand side of the allotments are you there.
yeah right.
right okay.
see if you drew a straight line just east for about twelve thirteen centimetres.
okay.
east.
right.
right okay right.
just go go up about a centimetre from the edge of that so you're sort of going diagonally up that way if you know what i mean from it's about twelve or thirteen centimetres.
i'm going right.
right okay right.
not directly east but up a wee bit gradually aiming up the way.
i've got that.
yeah right got it got it right okay right.
okay.
i'm a-- and i've just come to the left-hand side of the all-- the yacht club.
right.
yes.
right okay.
but you're about thirteen fourteen centimetres up the page.
f-- not as many as that.
you're not oh j--.
i'm about six.
oh no.
see your see your line from the top left-hand side of the allotments.
where is it in relation to like the west lake.
i've not got a west lake.
have you not.
no.
disused monastery.
i've got a disused monastery aye.
where are we in relation to that.
right.
in relation to that we're due south about ten fif-- ten twelve centimetres.
cannae be due south.
have you got a disused.
is y-- is your is your d--.
we're not due south.
is your disused monastery in the centre of the page.
yeah right in the centre.
right hold on have you got a sar--.
right start from again start the beginning.
where's your yacht club.
where's my yacht club.
far right.
away over at the bottom.
right.
okay.
right at the bottom right-hand side.
okay right.
we've got the same map haven't we.
it's my fault i know what.
paul this is this is lousy.
i know what you're meaning.
right.
right.
can we go back to the allotments.
yeah right we're back at the allotments okay.
are you at the top.
you're at the you're just at the side of the allotments right.
right okay.
okay.
right.
right.
see the allotments.
just draw a line right over the top of that east right.
right okay.
right over towar-- to stay about six centimetres from the edge of the page right east just go straight east.
right okay right.
forget about getting it up a wee bit.
right.
uh-huh okay.
right.
so that's where we are we're about i would say we're if you you could we're about six centimetres from the edge of the page from the right-hand edge of the page and about six or seven centimetres up from the bottom as well.
right.
right okay.
correct.
right fine right.
right.
oh dear.
draw draw a line from there.
you've got a disused monastery right.
yeah.
you're going from where you are just now just straight up and round the top of the monastery like a wee hill over the top of the monastery right going from the right-hand side of the monastery over to the left-hand side.
right okay.
right fine.
okay.
got you.
now you're coming down and you're doing the exact same hump again except invert it and you're going up.
have you got an alpine garden.
have i hell.
you've not.
right.
no.
oh yeah i do yeah i do.
you do have an alpine garden.
uh-huh.
well you're doing a sort of hump you're just going up the side of the alpine garden.
right.
up the left-hand side sorry.
up the left-hand side of it.
the left-hand side of the alpine garden.
so you should have.
so i'm going across underneath the alpine garden.
you're.
right uh-huh.
you're going across to underneath the left-hand side of the alpine garden then you're going straight up.
okay.
okay.
just to the top of just to the top left-hand bit of the alpine garden.
have you got a youth hostel.
okay.
no.
you've not.
right.
the youth hostel is about it's a couple of centimetres to the left eh to the right and a couple of centimetres above the alpine garden right so it's very c--.
couple of centimetres to the right and a couple of centimetres above.
d--.
above right.
right.
so it's sort of.
now you're going eh i would say about you're at the left-hand side of the alpine garden go across about two centimetres right just east.
the left-hand s--.
right.
you're you're at the top left of the alpine garden.
right okay i'm here right.
or have you drawn another line.
i've got it no i'm at the top.
right.
top left of the alpine garden.
top left of the alpine garden.
draw a line about two centimetres right but just directly across.
okay.
so i'm coming into about the middle of the alpine garden.
yea-- eh uh-huh.
over to the.
you see the wee two two wee bricks at the edge of the alpine garden.
there's two wee.
there's two.
two i don't know what they are is it bricks or is it grass right whatever it is och well it's two centimetres along anyway yes.
about.
to the middle of the alpine garden.
aye.
just a wee bit to the right of middle.
right.
sort of two thirds of the way along.
right got it.
eh right.
got you.
and then you're going up about thr-- four centimetres st-- directly north right about four centimetres.
okay.
"so you should be from the you should be round about above the letter ""e"" or ""n"" of garden eh about six centimetres or something is that right."
yeah right okay fine yeah.
okay.
we're not we're not bad we're a wee bit.
eh a wee bit.
eh a wee bit a wee bit inside it.
no it's it's my fault.
eh right so you're up there eh go right for about three centimetres.
right.
th-- to underneath the parked van.
eh.
under the parked.
underneath the pa-- uh-huh underneath the parked van.
what what letter am i under.
go th-- go right.
"you should be under the letter ""d""."
right okay.
"right under the letter ""d""."
right.
"i'm under ""d""."
right.
have you got a telephone box.
ehm yeah.
but it's away down on the right-hand side.
police.
right okay.
you're doing a massive diagonal sort of south east.
right.
okay.
"right to the bottom right to the letter ""t"" from where you are."
"to the letter ""t""."
"to the letter ""t"" of telephone box."
okay.
right.
and then you're just going right drawing a line right underneath as if you're underlining telephone box and back up the right-hand side up the way now i'll tell you about that in a minute.
up right.
right so you're going up.
have you got a thatched m-- thatched mud hut.
i've got no thatched mud huts anywhere.
you've not.
there's a thatched mud hut about.
apart from at home.
you've got a mud hut.
right.
you've got a mud hut about six centimetres above the telephone box directly above it.
directly above it okay.
right.
eh so what you're doing is sort of drawing.
so i'm missing it then.
"if you c-- if you can imagine an ""s"" round the thatched mud hut and the telephone box right."
if y-- if y-- f-- oh forget.
oh wow.
oh groovy.
you've not got the mud huts.
i've got it yeah.
i've got a level crossing.
right.
have you got a les-- a level crossing.
i have not no i've not.
right so i've got to miss i.
right hold on where are you just now.
right.
"you're at the bottom of ""x"" oh right are you up a bit."
i i've just come up a wee bit.
you've come up a wee bit.
"well i would go up from the ""x"" right you're going up about three centimetres."
okay.
to the top of the telephone box.
to the top of the telephone box right.
right fine.
and then you're sort of going diagonally across about eh i would say exactly sort of t-- what's it north i don't know what's the one northwest.
no--.
northwest uh-huh.
if you go exactly northwest for about three centimetres four centimetres four centimetres right.
yeah.
right.
"exactly northwest for four centimetres you should end up above the letter round about ""t"" or ""e"" of telephone box about s-- eight centimetres above it."
is that right see where i am.
okay i've got it yeah.
"""t"" or ""e""."
then go.
have you got the east lake up at the top.
i've got the east lake yeah.
you have got the east lake.
have you got a finish.
you haven't got a fini--.
no i don't no.
right okay.
eh where are you just now.
you're at th-- oh you're beside my thatched mud hut.
"eh you're going up just go directly north to the side of the east lake under the letter ""k"" ""e"" you know ""k"" or ""e"" in east lake."
so i.
just to the edge of the east lake right.
"am i doing an ""s"" round telephone."
"an ""f""."
"an ""s""."
"i've only got half an ""s""."
"an ""s""."
uh-huh.
yeah aye.
you're not going the other you're aye.
right.
"so i'm going up towards ""k"" or ""e""."
you're only doing.
"""k"" or ""e""."
"just directly north to ""k"" or ""e""."
right okay i can right.
and you're about half a centimetre away from the edge of the east lake the bottom edge of it.
right.
okay.
right okay.
and then i would say you're about three cen-- four centimetres.
you're following the edge of the east lake right up for about a centimetre beyond the left-hand edge of it.
see where it gets pointy.
so i'm going up i'm going up the l-- so i'm going over to the left here.
yes.
you're going over to the over to the left over to the corner.
a-- and over to the the corn--.
and about a centimetre beyond the corner keeping the same contour as the lake same edge of it.
right.
okay.
and that's the finish that's it about a centimetre beyond the edge of that.
right.
sorry about the mess here in your diagram.
we're there.
so the parked van didn't come in.
eh the parked van was nothing to do with it.
and the picket fence.
eh the picket fence no that was another red herring.
and the west lake.
eh the west i've not got a west lake.
your yacht club should be absolutely.
the yacht club's away out of it as well yeah okay.
right that's okay that's good.
i think we're roughly in the same area.
right.
ehm the diamond mine the d-- the diamond mine is like just eh to the the the right of you there.
right i've got the diamond mine.
i've got the start and the diamond mine.
right.
"now just go down beside the left-hand side of the diamond mine and eh just to below the words the first ""d"" there."
right.
"then draw a line ehm a kind of go from there eh to just below the ""s"" of springboks."
don't have springboks.
you don't have spri-- that's right.
ehm okay right.
"in that case just draw a horizontal line to just below the eh to the the left of the ""h"" of highest viewpoint."
horizontal.
yes horizontal right.
hold on right.
now we're going to go round eh highest viewpoint.
okay.
so eh.
a curve or.
"it well we can do it in a well just go eh vertically up to the ""h""."
right.
then make a curve round to the eh like a semicircle.
right.
okay.
eh is there anything below there.
there's the overgrown gully.
right.
and eh what about safari truck.
yes i've got that.
now where's the overgrown gully.
it's between highest viewpoint and the safari truck.
eh what the midway between them.
yes.
and eh to the left or right of highest viewpoint.
it's beneath it.
it's to the right-hand side.
it's directly beneath it.
to the right-hand side of safari truck.
slightly to the right-hand side.
right of this one right okay.
right to the middle of highest viewpoint anyway.
okay right.
so go on the outsides eh towards the paper edge ehm down to safari truck in a a slight curve.
right.
and then eh draw a diagonal line ehm from there across the top of safari truck down to field station.
that's on my map it's slightly above field station slightly above safari truck.
what is above that f--.
above that's field station's on a level slightly above safari truck.
right.
well mine's eh on the same level.
ehm it what what is there anything else that's in eh that's causing it to be up like that.
well there's a banana tree direc-- directly below diamond mine.
right.
it's slightly below safari truck slightly below the level of safari truck.
right okay.
well eh wh-- you're just next to the eh that what was the object you've just drawn past.
i've just drawn past the overgrown gully.
i'm now at the top right-hand corner of safari truck.
right.
ehm well draw eh a kind of diagonal line and then turn it.
up or down.
eh from right to left eh downwards.
eh underneath field station.
right that's way over the la-- the far left-hand side of the page on my map.
where is field station.
field station's way over the far left.
it's the far l-- uh.
well there's two field stations on my map.
there's not one on mine.
right.
so you've only got one there.
yes.
and none there in the centre right.
ehm in that case you want to draw the diagonal line and then.
where is banana tree.
banana tree is directly below diamond mine and it's slightly above the centre of the page.
right.
so eh well draw this d-- diagonal line down and then change it to a curve at the top level of banana tree and curve it round banana tree ehm with the apex of the curve pointing to the top right-hand corner sorry left-hand corner.
right what was that again sorry.
right.
this pen's running out i think.
if you hold it eh vertically it'll come down.
it's gone.
ah right.
is it okay now.
yes.
right ehm right i'll just do the the bit at the safari truck right.
draw a diagonal line from where you were.
right.
right.
eh to the same just below the s-- the level of s-- the word safari truck and ab-- abou-- between banana tree and safari truck.
okay.
okay.
which is slightly above eh banana tree.
right.
right.
then draw a curve over banana tree ehm and curving round on it.
down the left-hand side.
right.
and ehm now do you have gold mine between eh banana tree and rock fall at the bottom there.
no.
right.
in that case eh well gold mine on my map is halfway between rock fall and banana tree.
okay.
directly below.
okay.
it's directly below banana tree and directly above rock fall a--.
right.
and it's eh in the at the mid point of the two of that line.
okay.
right.
so ehm i want you to come down to two thirds of the way between eh rock fall and banana tree have.
is that two thirds beneath banana tree or two thirds up.
two t-- eh that's two third beneath banana tree.
right.
right ehm now there i want you to draw ehm a horizontal line to the left sorry to the right sorry eh to the right just eh so that you're on the other side of banana tree if you understand.
right.
then the rope bridge can you see that on your map.
yes.
that's slightly above it's between where i am and banana tree roughly about halfway between.
between where you are and where.
banana tree.
right well.
it's on a line roughly between that it's over to the right-hand side of the page.
right.
ehm are crocodiles the other side of the thing.
yes.
yeah.
ehm and eh the crocodile's to the right of the rope bridge.
yes.
right.
to the right and below.
right and below right.
ehm what i want you to do is.
is there anything between the go-- eh between the where you are now and the rope bridge.
no.
right.
i want you to draw a line up to the rope bridge.
straight line.
yes a straight line up to rope bridge so that you can cross the rope bridge the actual bridge drawing of the bridge right.
right.
now do you have giraffes at the bottom eh right-hand corner.
yes.
right.
i want you to eh draw round the crocodile eh on the outside of the page down to giraffes.
right.
right i want you to go underneath the giraffes.
and there's any other obstacles there.
there's a disused warehouse at the bottom roughly about two a third of the way in from the right.
right.
right.
is it eh bel-- is it above great lake and below g-- giraffes.
no.
it's to the right of great lake on a level with it.
right.
well in that case i want you to ehm eh curve slightly up to eh just go underneath the giraffes and eh to on a level with the the word giraffes and stop there.
right.
right now i want you to eh go round the warehouse eh and under the great lake.
by round i mean over like over the eh the warehouse.
okay.
right.
right and then under the great lake.
is there any other obstacles there.
no.
and then come up between eh.
now it's the great lake and eh rock fall halfway between them but over to the left-hand side of the page is the finish point.
okay.
right.
starting at the beginning head due south.
you'll see a diamond mine on your map.
mmhmm.
avoid the diamond mine.
due south.
going due south followed by east.
to the left of the diamond mine.
to the west.
east the right.
so you want me to go east then south.
no.
south then east.
we may have a different map.
uh-huh right.
can you head due south.
sorry.
can you head due south.
i can head due south.
am i meant i'm meant to draw this on aren't i right.
and can you then head to the right past the diamond mine.
yes.
go for it.
how far.
you'll see a graveyard.
do you see a graveyard on your map to the right of the diamond mine.
no.
right.
they've obviously not marked the graveyard.
how far to the right of diamond mine is it.
the graveyard is almost halfway in between.
do you have carved stones.
i have carved stones at the top followed by a ravine followed by an indian country.
right.
in between the diamond mine and the carved stones is the graveyard that's where it should be.
right.
so what you need to do is continue past the diamond mine then past where you think the graveyard is.
and then stop.
past where it is.
yeah.
go rou-- same under under the graveyard south of the graveyard.
is the graveyard due east of the diamond mine.
the graveyard's.
correct.
so i really shouldn't hit it then if i'm south of the diamond mine.
correct.
right okay.
s-- you then come no-- up north just to the left to the west of the carved stones.
okay.
so if you're almost on top of carved stones then you'll totally miss the graveyard.
okay.
right so i am now just directly north of the carved stones and slightly north of the start.
that's correct.
so you move east around carved stones.
the carved stones.
and then do you have gallows on your map.
yes.
but they're absolutely miles away.
that's correct that's correct.
all you need to do is go due south from the carved stones as far as you can see the gallows the same level as the gallows.
past.
right.
you should be on top of the indian country correct.
um and just south of the ravine.
that's right.
do you have a great rock.
i have a great rock.
it's to the west of indian country.
no.
it's very very southwest of indian country.
right.
that's a different great rock.
okay what you have to do is.
now that you're paral-- parallel with the gallows right.
mmhmm.
you're on a level with the gallows.
i'm on a level.
head southwest that's to the left and down past indian country.
move west followed by south down to.
no.
s-- straight southwest.
okay.
not too far.
right.
i'm just below indian country.
do you see the gold mine.
do you see the gold mine.
which is due we-- due west.
uh-huh.
yeah.
i want you to go.
west making sure that you remain above the gold mine.
understand.
so you go due west above the gold mine.
okay.
but n-- not too far north 'cause otherwise you'll hit the rock so i want you to head just above the gold mine.
right.
are you above the gold mine now.
i'm.
just to the west of it.
just i'm just to the east of it.
do you want me to go f-- slightly further.
yeah.
i want you to go just past it.
right.
so you're basically in the gap between the gallows and the gold mine.
and the gold mine right.
and i want you to go due sou--.
do you have a trout farm.
yes.
but.
right.
it's.
that is coming due south followed by due east just above the totem pole just above the totem pole if you had the totem pole.
that's correct i think.
want you to head due south as far south as the trout farm just below the trout farm.
just above the trout farm.
b-- just below the trout farm.
right.
i'm i think i'm just below the trout farm.
and head east.
east.
and land just below the trout farm.
ah do you have any other obstacles.
none.
in the way.
well head due east just below the trout farm trying to avoid any obstacles on your way.
okay.
i'm just below it directly below it i'm not east or west of it.
right.
now i've got a cavalry stockade on this map.
a cavalry a cattle stockade.
no.
cavalry it's a fort thing.
right.
so we need to avoid that.
well we don't.
which means.
is it directly south.
it's almost south of the sou-- the trout farm it's south and slightly to the east.
mmhmm.
so i want you to go right past the trout farm almost to the edge of the map to make sure we miss it.
okay.
so you're past your totem pole there as well you're.
my totem pole is directly below my gold mine.
that's all right.
right.
i want you to go due south now.
how far.
ehm do you have a cattle stockade.
i do.
just above it.
right.
just below it you want to go round the bottom of it.
do you want me to go to the bottom of the page.
uh-huh that's correct.
right.
i want you to go west below the stockade.
and below the parched river bed which i don't know if you have.
although oh i don't have a river bed so.
do you have a bandit t--.
is your river bed.
whereabouts is level becau--.
do you have a bandit territory.
uh-huh.
directly bas-- directly we-- west of your cattle stockade.
correct.
that's in the middle of the two.
right.
my map deviates here so i presume that's why you must have an obstacle.
"so what i want you to do is go west as far left as the sta-- s-- just the edge of the ""c"" of the s-- cattle stockade."
m--.
mmhmm.
then do you have to go up to avoid the.
well if there's a very very thin line i ca-- i can go up though yes.
because that's how this map indicates.
so i want you to go up not straight up ehm northwest.
i can go north then west.
up up in a curve.
i want you to go northwest in a one-er.
right will i go in a one-er.
uh-huh.
it's a curve curve shape.
right you want me to curve.
where t-- where am i curving to.
curving up to the northwest followed by down to the southwest.
so you.
s-- so i want you to go basically curve up and then down.
you want me to go you want to curve up to about the level of the great rock i don't know if you have that.
no.
not as far as that.
see m--.
only a small curve.
oh okay.
to about the m-- the middle of the fencing of the sto-- the cattle stockade.
north east.
northwest to the left of the page.
okay.
and then curve back down to the bottom of the page.
uh-huh that's correct.
'cause presumably we must be avoiding the river is that correct.
yeah.
and then we go due west along the bottom under the bandit territory.
okay.
and then curve round and up to the finish.
do you have finish on your map.
i don't have a finish.
above my bandit territory about an inch i have a great rock followed by two inches then a totem pole.
right.
keep going past the bandit terri-- territory.
due north.
are due west of the bandit territory yet.
i am now west of bandit territory.
right.
continue until you're about an inch two inches away from the edge of the page.
right.
and curve up to it the point just above the s-- cactus of the bandit terri-- territory.
understand.
just dire--.
so on the level.
just basically right above it but not touching it.
no.
the level of it but about an inch two inches in from the page.
alright.
understand what i mean.
right so basically just due north to the level of the.
correct.
right.
"and that's your ""x"" that's your finish."
is it.
okay phil.
right.
on my map i have a telephone kiosk in the bottom left-hand corner.
uh-huh.
okay the route starts above it.
mmhmm.
directly above it about on my map about half an inch from the top of the telephone kiosk.
yeah got you.
okay.
it's a dotted line that moves around to the left of the k-- telephone kiosk down.
mmhmm.
passing around the left-hand side of the stone circle.
stone circle.
yeah.
how don't think i've got that on my map i have a telephone kiosk and a the nearest thing is a broken gate to the bottom right-hand.
yeah.
well under on on my map directly under the telephone kiosk.
mmhmm.
at the right on the bottom left-hand corner of the page i have a stone circle.
yeah.
right.
so if you could take your route straight down 'til about an inch above the bottom of the page.
uh-huh.
okay.
right.
then go straight straight on.
to the r--.
horizontally about and for about another inch.
to the right.
yeah to the right.
right.
okay.
okay.
now if you move straight up you're going to be on the left-hand side of that farmer's gate.
right.
that correct.
yeah.
okay.
if you move straight up until you're at the top left-hand corner of the broken gate.
mmhmm.
right.
okay.
now we're going to move do you have a meadow in the bottom right-hand corner.
meadow yeah uh-huh.
okay.
now you're going to move in a diagonal line.
do you have little seagulls drawn on it.
no not at all.
little birds.
okay.
oh yeah sorry i do yeah.
no you do.
uh-huh.
well i've got five little birds on mine.
yeah just above the meadow.
okay.
right.
so if you take the middle bird.
uh-huh.
and you move up the page until you're probably about to a point that's about half an inch horizontally higher than the point you're at at the farmer's gate.
right.
okay.
mmhmm.
now if you take your route from where you are now to that point.
right.
diagonally upwards.
right.
okay we're going to move up from there to the ruined monastery.
right.
and your route's.
h-- have you got overnight accommodation on yours.
no i don't.
well i've got overnight accommodation in a diagonal line between the ruined monastery and the point i'm at just now.
in a diagonal line.
yeah.
it's about if upwards was north it would be northwest of where i am just now.
yeah oh that sounds that sounds like the same route that i have here.
does that take you up to the top right-hand corner say of the the ruined monastery you know just off the ruined monastery.
erm well.
by that pa--.
if i was goi-- to go up in a straight line just now i'd end up slightly to the right of the ruined monastery.
okay.
well it's slightly diagonally northwest as you said.
yeah well that's through the overnight accommodation then.
well that's that'd be good.
i don't suppose that's an obstacle really.
no.
that'd be quite good actually.
right go straight through it then.
yeah.
we're going right up there and around the top of the ruined monastery curving round the top.
curving round the top the right-hand side or the left-hand side.
oh we're coming up you're coming up on the right-hand side.
mmhmm.
and you're going over to the left-hand side and down.
right.
so it's curved down towards the west lake.
sorry where am i going from the point just now just up northwest.
up northwest.
uh-huh.
say to the top right-hand corner of the ruined monastery.
uh-huh.
okay and you're going to draw like a small arch just skimming round the outside of it.
right.
right.
to the left.
an arch.
down to the left yes.
yeah.
okay.
mmhmm.
now you're going to keep moving downwards like in an arc.
yeah.
around the edge of the west lake.
do you have the west lake on yours.
nope not at all no.
okay.
let me see.
now you've skimmed an arch around the top of the ruined monastery.
yeah.
come down about an inch keep the keep the arc coming down for about an inch.
mmhmm.
right.
past the bottom of the ruined monastery.
right.
okay now you're going to curve it back.
do you have a stile.
up to.
eh yeah uh-huh.
yeah.
yeah.
well if you can curve it round until a point that's directly below the left-hand corner of the stile.
mmhmm.
and then move straight upwards towards the left-hand side skim round the left-hand side of the stile.
am i doing an arc eh that's curving up and over to the left.
yeah.
you've just done one that's curved down.
uh-huh.
from the ruined monastery and you're curving back up now towards the stile.
right.
on the left-hand side of it.
yeah.
right i'm there.
okay come over the top.
mmhmm.
and then once you're past the stile go straight up about two inches.
uh-huh.
okay.
yeah.
right at this point across t-- and down to the right-hand side of your page do you have a dead tree.
eh no.
i have a dutch elm but erm.
well that's.
is that the dead tree.
possibly.
yeah.
above.
well it's on the very far right-hand side of the page though.
right.
yeah.
on the ri-- dilect directly right across from where you are do you have a great viewpoint a drawing of a telescope i have here.
eh it's directly above where i am just now directly above the stile about four inches.
yeah i've got that.
i've got another one across to the right.
no i haven't got that one.
okay.
and do you have the east lake up in the top right-hand corner.
uh-huh.
yeah.
where you are just now should be horizontally across from say just below the bottom right-hand tip of it that's how high you should be on the map.
the great viewpoint.
no.
no from the ea-- the bottom right-hand corner of the east lake.
bottom right-hand corner uh-huh.
okay.
uh-huh.
now you should be say about a half an inch below that only across the other side of the page.
yeah got that exactly yeah.
excellent.
now you see where the ruined monastery is.
yeah uh-huh.
back to the ruined monastery again.
straight line up.
and you've got you've got an elm tree sort of just off to the right of that.
oh right.
yeah uh-huh.
okay.
what we're going to do then is draw a diagonal line from where you are now.
mmhmm.
down to a point that goes around the outside of the elm tree.
right.
i've got a popular tourist spot erm between the dutch elm and where i am just now.
do you.
yeah.
so go straight through that.
yeah go straight through it.
towards the dutch elm.
yeah.
and which side of the dutch elm should i end up on.
y-- you're going to draw a line around the outside of it so you should be underneath the dutch elm.
right.
so i'm drawing a line around the top of the dutch elm ending up at underneath it.
yeah that's right.
right.
right.
we're going to curve around the outside of the elm.
mmhmm.
okay.
i've done that yeah.
now.
this dutch elm you have if you look across the page to the stile again.
uh-huh.
is it beneath the stile or.
slightly beneath it the base of the dutch elm is about maybe half an inch below the bottom of the stile.
uh-huh.
and away f-- is it about an inch away from the right-hand side of the page.
yeah uh-huh.
oh must be the same tree i would think anyway.
mmhmm.
sounds similar.
okay you're going to come around the outside of that.
yeah.
you'll be about an inch away from the right-hand s-- edge of the page.
right.
okay.
mmhmm.
and you're going to come back in as if you'd drawn about two thirds of a circle around the tree just about.
right got you.
okay.
yeah.
now.
you don't have a telescope between you and the the east lake no.
no.
a great viewpoint.
do you have any kind of marking at all.
i've.
rocket launch pad.
a rocket launch pad.
yeah.
excellent.
eh no i don't have a rocket launch pad on mine.
but i don't think that would be a tremendously good place to go through.
no.
right.
okay.
do you have east lake written on the east lake.
uh-huh yeah.
yeah.
"see where the ""e"" is."
uh-huh.
"erm if you draw a line if you are just about directly beneath that ""e""."
mmhmm.
"okay draw a line up to the water's edge maybe just to the right of that ""e""."
s-- straight up.
straight up yeah.
"just slightly to the right of the ""e""."
mmhmm.
until you're just like virtually on the water's edge.
mmhmm.
okay.
right.
now mark your route along the water's edge to a point that's just past the sort of bottom left-hand edge of it.
uh-huh.
okay.
that's pointing.
bottom left-hand edge.
yeah.
if if your line is pointing you-- you're not we're not going to take it that far but if your line is pointing towards the great viewpoint which is on the top left-hand corner.
uh-huh.
and you're still underneath the east lake then that's you.
right.
right got you.
"""x"" marks the spot and we're finished."
so where am i going now to the great viewpoint.
that's you.
no that's you.
right.
have you got a diamond mine on it.
i have.
oh right.
have you got starting right up the top left a diamond.
yeah mmhmm.
mine right.
well just sort of go down follow it round sort of square go down then just take a right.
to there's i'm under the d--.
"and end up at the ""e"" of the diamond mine know what i mean."
just go straight down and round it.
right.
"and stop at the ""e""."
er have you got springboks.
right.
no i haven't.
have you got highest viewpoint.
yes.
well w-- from where are just now just go straight right.
right.
"and then just end up just go horizontally and just sort of eh end up just before the ""h"" in highest viewpoint."
"ha-- so i'm under the ""h""."
just before just before it.
on the same level as the diamond mine.
aye.
right.
and then just go straight up to quite close to the top.
right.
and then go to your right about oh my god.
over the viewpoint.
mmhmm.
just go.
to the.
just go right over the side of it and sort of leave about a centimetre gap and then just come round down it just come down.
down to the bottom right.
aye.
"just stop at the ""t""."
right.
right.
have you got safari truck.
i have.
well just go down to just above safari truck.
is it does it curve a wee bit.
i've got an overgrown gully here as well.
you've got a what.
an overgrown gully.
well i can manage it straight down.
well d-- just go round go round the overgrown gully however you want then just end up above safari truck.
'cause i don't have overgrown gully.
right.
to the top right of the safari truck.
eh it doesn't really matter 'cause we're going round it just end up anywhere t-- above a-- just above it.
right.
you've done that.
mmhmm.
right.
have you got field station.
no.
have you got banana tree.
mmhmm.
well.
go to just end up i don't know how you get there just get.
"see the ""s"" of safari truck."
mmhmm.
just sort of end up to the bottom left of that.
going round to the r-- left or the right.
to the left doesnae really matter but to the left.
"right i'm on the ""s"" of safari truck."
right.
now just go down a bit so that you're sort of level with the top of the banana tree.
right.
and then go straight across to the top left of the banana tree just sort of skirting the top of it.
'cause there's a field station here.
right.
have you got gold mine.
no.
have you got a rope bridge.
yeah.
well from the banana tree right just go straight down about christ so you're about a third of the way down the pa-- two thirds of the way down the page.
level with the rope bridge.
a bit l-- lower than that.
but straight down.
about three four centimetres lower than that.
right.
in fact d-- jus-- go just go down a wee bit further so you make sure you miss it.
have you got a rock fall.
aye.
how far above that should i be.
oh.
about the height of the whole rock fall maybe a bit more.
right.
and then go to your right see what i mean sort of just sort of curve up the way and then go through the rope bridge.
from from the left-hand side to the right.
uh-huh.
is there anything i've got to avoid here.
i've got a big blank space.
eh.
go right a bit go right about ten centimetres or something.
then curve.
aye.
and then just go up and then go right through the rope bridge.
okay okay.
have you got giraffes.
i have.
i've got crocodiles as well.
where are they.
un-- just under the right-hand side of the rope bridge.
well avoid them and then just go right round then go round the gira--.
avoid them to the right or the left.
er it doesn't really matter.
"as long as you end up on the right of the giraffes and come round the bottom of the giraffes and end up sort of like underneath the ""g""."
okay.
and then sort of eh.
have you great lake.
yes.
"well just go left from there and go right round underneath the great lake and just sort of stop at the ""g"" again."
yeah wait a minute.
so i've got to avoid the disused warehouse here.
well i've got nothing there.
well just avoid it somehow.
"right so i'm under the ""g""."
right.
right.
and then.
jesus.
see the gap in between the great lake and the rock fall.
mmhmm.
right.
well you're going to go up about a.
oh jesus trying to explain this erm.
"are you just underneath the ""g""."
mmhmm.
well go about three centimetres to the left and then go up about another four centimetres.
right.
then that's it finish hopefully.
right.
s-- straight down south quite a bit and you'll pass um some cliffs on the east.
sandstone cliff.
uh-huh.
mm oh aye.
cliffs on the east.
right.
then keep going down and you'll pass a forge on the east as well.
forge.
no.
well keep going down past the cliffs.
right.
and then um.
you go east in a curve curve down towards the east.
and then back up again and you sh-- go past um a pine on your right.
dow--.
down below that.
up above it.
up above it.
past the side of it.
keep it on your right right and go up 'til you get just p-- above the top of it.
right.
right.
and then go due east.
right.
and.
start going down southeast you go past a pine forest on your right.
keep to my left or what.
mmhmm.
right.
right um.
down curve under it towards east curve under it slightly don't go past the edge of it though the the fu-- far away edge and then.
edge of the fine pine fore--.
the pine forest uh-huh.
and then down south.
mm.
um and then curve to the east above a bakery.
no so you do you want me to go right round pine forest.
no.
just 'til you're underneath it and then go south when you're underneath it.
like have you got a forest stream th--.
no.
right.
so i've to go above the bakery down and and round.
mmhmm.
top of the bakery.
uh-uh 'til you're above the bakery.
right.
right.
and then curve round about the bakery like to the east.
right.
right so you're underneath the bakery.
right.
right.
and then go west.
right.
reach a canal.
no.
um right.
and then go south.
and there's a crane bay.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
right.
now.
curve to the west like above the crane bay like following the edge of it.
mmhmm.
right.
'til you you're coming to like going away from the edge of it.
mmhmm.
and then it's southwest slightly going round about underneath wheatfields.
mmhmm.
right underneath the wheatfields.
and keep going west 'til you're just about past the wheatfields.
right.
right.
and then go down southwest.
right.
right.
towards the edge of the map.
right.
and then south and then curve back round again southeast 'til you come to the lighthouse.
well.
so you went south and then you're going southeast you're going towards the east more or less.
see it does that mean like if you between the caves and the the warehouse um.
i'll just get to the lighthouse.
mmhmm.
is that how it finish.
take it to the lighthouse.
uh-huh and that's it finished.
right.
right.
right.
okay.
now you're starting ehm above the diamond mine.
mmhmm.
and er the desert is below to your left.
uh-huh.
right.
now.
go go south from the diamond mine until you are still above the desert.
okay.
okay.
now.
if you tell me what's to your right at the what's to your right.
ehm.
the canoes.
canoes.
and a fast running creek.
and a fast running creek.
um.
and do you have a graveyard.
no.
do you have a carved wooden pole in this area.
right away down the very bottom.
right okay.
now.
go go right from the diamond mine.
okay.
okay.
and um.
now you've got to pass.
there's actually a graveyard to the right of the diamond mine on my map.
below it.
no.
on the same level as the diamond mine.
mm.
and so you're going to pa-- you're going to pass by the graveyard as well.
mm.
and then you're going to go up and over the top of the f-- uh.
what i've got is a fast flowing river.
mmhmm.
do you have you have your c--.
fast running creek.
fast running creek.
where is that on a level with the diamond mine or is it slightly below.
it's just slightly above.
slightly above.
right.
well i've got a fast flowing river here.
so.
what you'd best to do is go along past the bottom go along okay sorry go along to your right and veer slightly upwards as you reach the creek.
mmhmm.
and then go over and round the creek to your right.
and then ehm.
do you have an apache camp.
uh-huh.
right.
see when you're over the top of the fast or your creek or the river that i've got here when you're over the top of that and in line vertically in line with the apache camp.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
go south until just above the apache camp.
okay.
right.
when you reach the apache camp.
ehm do you have a walled city.
right away on the far left.
right.
well you're going to go from above the apache camp to the walled city but you've got to avoid a carved wooden pole.
which in my map is slightly above the level of the apache camp.
no this is vertically in line with the walled city below it.
right.
okay so.
right i've got one of them as well.
right.
so.
but there's another one a carved wooden pole here which is halfway between the walled city and the apache camp.
okay.
mmhmm.
but slightly above the level of the apache camp.
so.
i'd be better to go underneath it.
okay.
uh-huh.
right.
so you've got so you're going from above the apache camp underneath the carved wooden pole and over the top of the walled city.
and then when you reach the far si-- yo-- your left-hand side of the walled city travel southwards until you come to the level of some flat rocks.
uh-huh.
and go bel--.
do you have a stone creek.
uh-huh.
right so.
what i want you to do is go between the flat rocks and the stone creek.
but do you have anything between the walled city and the carved wooden pole.
ghost town.
a ghost town.
so you're going to.
that's not on my map.
you've got to avoid that i think.
okay.
so go south down past the walled city underneath your ghost town and then slightly up sort of northeast direction between the flat rocks and the stone creek.
between.
well.
it'd be better if i s-- s-- between the walled city and the ghost town no to go underneath it above it.
or have you got something else there.
i've not got anything betw-- between the carved wooden pole and the walled city.
"but the map shows a curve a ""c""-shaped curve."
right.
score that out.
right.
right.
and sort of and then slightly up underneath the flat rocks and above the stone creek.
right.
okay.
then.
go slightly to your right beyond the flat rocks until you are above the level of the buffalo.
so i i'll be avoiding the saloon bar.
i don't have a saloon bar here.
i've got here.
right.
okay so avoid the saloon bar.
right.
and ehm then right then ehm.
just straight down to the right of the buffalo.
to the right.
y--.
so that so that you're on you're on the right of the buffalo.
right.
okay.
and go underneath the buffalo.
now.
do you have a cattle ranch.
no.
ehm do you have a fort.
mmhmm.
so you're going to go from the buffalo to the fort but you've got to avoid the cattle ranch on the way and you'll have to go up and over the top of the cattle ranch.
right.
which on my map is halfway between the buffalo and the fort.
okay.
right.
that on the the level between the fort mm.
ehm.
it's almost on level with the fort but it's slightly higher than the fort.
so.
so you need to be go up on a sort of hill.
mmhmm.
over the cattle ranch.
underneath buffalo or over the cattle ranch.
right.
then underneath the fort.
under the fort.
underneath the fort uh-huh.
and come out at the left-hand side of the fort and finishing ehm not beside but on the same level as the the carved wooden pole the base of the carved woode-- wooden pole.
right.
okay that's you finished.
okay.
right neil erm at the bottom.
right-hand corner of your map do you have a missionary camp.
yeah.
"about half an inch above it we've got an ""x"" marking start."
have you got that.
yes.
yes.
right.
erm now i want you to take a route about one inch directly west.
if the top of the page is north and the left-hand side of the page is west.
i want you to go about one inch west.
okay.
now eh.
we're heading about two inches southwest.
eh which should leave you t-- at the bottom left-hand corner of the missionary camp about an inch diagonally away from it.
right.
got you.
and then ab-- about an inch from the bottom of the page as well.
sure okay.
now on your map on the left-hand bottom corner do you have a bunch of rather nasty looking gorillas.
no i don't.
well i do and i think it's something we might want to avoid.
right.
right so erm.
my route tells me to go on a slightly dipping downwards line west but don't draw it yet 'til i give you the exact instructions.
okay.
this line is dipping slightly down and to the left keeping about well you'd be better to go to within about half an inch of the bottom of the page so at the bottom left-hand corner you should be about an inch from both the left-hand side and the bottom of the page a-- a half an inch from the a--.
sorry i'll start that again.
should be an inch from the left-hand side of the page and half an inch from the bottom side of the page at the bottom left-hand corner.
okay.
is this avoiding the banana tree.
avoiding no.
avoiding gorillas.
have you got banana tree.
i've got a banana tree.
but it's probably in much the same place.
yeah.
right.
i'll just go to where you say it avoids the banana tree anyway.
right okay.
so you're heading s-- s-- west but slightly southerly.
yeah.
right.
stop about an inch from the left-hand side of the page.
yeah.
should be at a point about half an inch off the bottom of the page now.
yeah.
right.
now i think we should eh read the banana tree as where the gorillas live so.
right.
erm avoiding the banana tree i suppose.
erm go about.
yeah.
well hang on.
have you got a rope bridge on your map.
yeah i do.
right okay.
draw a line straight up horizontally level with the rope bridge.
okay.
eh go across the rope bridge and just stop at the end of it.
right.
go directly down half an inch.
right.
go to.
have you got a waterfall on your map at the right-hand side.
i do yeah.
yeah.
right.
go to the right and slightly upwards about half a centimetre upwards and about five centimetres to the right just beside the waterfall.
okay.
so have you got a cloud at your waterfall.
eh s--.
like a sort of steam you know vapour.
yeah uh-huh.
right well you should be at a point horizontally level and to the left of that cloud.
yeah.
right head s-- s-- have you got anything between the waterfall and the lost steps.
no sod all.
right.
go up about four inches directly up so you're at the top right-hand side of the lost steps.
four inches directly up the side top right-hand side.
yeah.
that's not directly up on mine.
alright.
where are the lost steps in relation to the waterfall.
they are about about seven inches away.
seven inches.
yeah.
well mine aren't slightly nearer mine are only about three inches away.
ah.
so if you go up four inches.
right.
right.
from where you were directly.
right straight up.
uh-huh.
right.
now draw an arc s-- a slight arc as if it was a lar-- a v-- very small part of a large circle from where you are to going slightly up and left and curving down to.
have you got the fallen pillars.
yeah.
right.
to the.
where are they in relation to the lost steps.
i mean where are they in relation to where you are now.
they they are exactly er a horizontal line away from me.
horizontally level.
uh-huh.
four inches away.
right okay.
draw an arc between where you are now to the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars.
an arc as in up arc or down arc.
yeah up up to the left round the lost steps and curving down between the fallen pillars and where you are just now.
right.
eh at the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars.
ah.
i can't go round the lost steps from where i am.
sorry.
no forget your lost steps.
i'm talking about my lost steps.
right okay.
sorry.
erm.
right.
if y-- have you got that arc yet erm are you at the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars.
yeah i've right.
yes i am now.
right.
erm right go about one and a half inches directly west.
right.
that's just past the fallen pillars.
yeah.
'til you're at th-- just beyond the f-- the far the bottom left-hand side of the fallen pillars.
okay.
right we'll just take a quick check here are you about two inches from the far left-hand side of the page.
well two inches.
well about two and a half.
but.
yeah well roughly.
all right okay.
and about nearly halfway up page.
yeah.
right.
eh right go about s-- eh see from where you are just now.
mmhmm.
if that was eh mm how can i put this if that was the bottom of a circle right no sorry the right-hand side of a circle right.
mmhmm.
at the middle point at the mid point of the right-hand side of the circle.
mmhmm.
i want you to draw a circle erm.
hang on don't draw it yet.
no i'm not drawing yet.
i i'm still i'm still thinking what i'm going to say here.
right so you're at the right-hand side of the circle.
yeah.
i want you to draw the circle it's about one and a half inches wide.
mmhmm.
eh 'til draw it downwards and to the left.
okay.
yeah.
so you're really drawing a semicircle really eh.
yeah.
and that should leave you in a within about a centimetre of the far left-hand side of the page.
yeah is that round have you got flamingoes.
no.
right.
i'll just draw around the flamingoes 'cause they look pretty vicious.
right.
right.
right now have you got ancient ruins.
that's it.
yeah i've well i've got i've got a ruined city.
on yours.
ruined city.
do you have sort of eh bricks and stuff and three three seagulls above it.
yeah.
and wee seagulls.
aye.
yeah.
yeah.
right well draw a line from where you are just now a straight one up to the right beside the ancient ruins left-hand side of the ancient ruins.
okay that's it.
eh and now draw a small line about half an inch long to until you're directly to the left-hand side of the seagulls within about half a centimetre of them.
so a diagonal line.
yeah.
right.
just aba-- just a wee short diagonal one just a slight deviation.
okay.
now have you got stones at the top left-hand point of your page.
rock fall.
rock fall.
yeah.
mm that doesn't sound too chuffed.
right okay anyway.
i've got stones here.
is the word rock fall under the rocks.
yeah.
sort of flat stones.
eh no.
mine's are all sort of falling no they're all round and falling.
jaggedy.
oh right okay.
erm well i suppose we've still got to follow this route.
right go straight up about erm mm two inches say.
okay.
from where you are just now.
where are you in relation to the rock fall just now.
right horizontal from it.
horizontal from it.
i-- aye.
right okay.
same same level as it.
well on mine the stones are slightly above where we are just now.
okay.
so um you go.
go up further.
so i think we're safe there.
i think there's two different things but very close.
yeah.
yeah.
right go east directly east about two inches and er.
whoa wait a minute.
have you got a white mountain there at the top right-hand corner.
yeah.
right okay.
go t-- about two inches to the bottom of the white mountain.
ah i can't do that my i'm about mm six inches away from the white mountain and two inches below it.
two inches below it.
yeah.
ehm where are you in relation to the top of the page just now.
where are.
uh about four inches.
four inches.
yeah.
where are you from the left-hand side.
about two.
right there're two bits right.
can you keep on going up until you're within about an inch and a half of the top.
yeah.
okay yeah done it.
right how close are you to the white mountain now.
uh about four inches away.
four inches right.
just round about the same level.
just go east to the base of the white mountain then.
okay.
eh now heading directly north east over the up to the peak of the white mountain.
northeast.
yeah north.
well i'm right underneath the mountain.
are you.
a-- directly right at the bottom.
oh sorry.
the bottom left.
y-- scrub that out.
all right i'll scrub out the line.
and we should be at the bottom.
right.
right n--.
left-hand corner of the white mountain.
right okay.
then i stop.
right.
up to the top.
eh yeah.
up to top northeast about two inches or so.
yeah.
one and a half maybe.
right back down eh southeast.
right.
the same distance.
now you're going into a curve.
have you got a soft furnishings store.
no.
well that's directly below the white mountain about an inch so we've got about an inch to play with here.
right.
"so i want you to curve round underneath the white mountain and then when when your curve is underneath the ""n"" of mountain."
m-- make it into a straight line eh going left about two inches.
uh-huh.
so going left straight horizontal left two inches.
yeah.
until you're under the base of the white mountain.
right.
i mean the left-hand side where you were when you started going up it.
yeah.
right.
okay.
right go about a c-- a further centimetre.
down.
left.
acr-- right.
now go straight down about three inches.
okay.
and curve round to the right just just a small curve the the length of the curve should be about two centimetres.
right.
and.
"is it an u-- an u-- a ""u""-turn or a."
well have you got gazelles on yours.
yeah.
right okay.
curve round the left-hand side of the gazelles.
ah but my gazelles are much further down.
ah right.
how far are they below the white mountain.
uh about six inches.
right okay.
well keep going.
i think they're the same as mine.
so.
just keep going in a straight line don't go into the curve yet until you get to the gazelles.
no.
and then curve round the gazelles.
curve round the gazelles 'til you're facing right now.
okay.
okay.
yeah.
right go about two inches.
and that's us finished.
two inches to the right.
yeah.
yeah.
right have you got a starting point at.
this ke-- this is kenneth.
have you got a starting point at the top left of your map corner.
right.
eh could you move about due south from that starting point about eh four inches.
right.
could could you move to the right of the point you're at now by three inches.
right.
could you move up three inches.
three inches.
mmhmm.
okay.
could you move to your right again approximately five inches.
right.
could you.
okay.
right right right.
i d-- think i know where you are.
right.
could you move down from the point you're at by about eh three inches.
okay.
could you go to your right another three inches.
eh well no a bit off the edge of the page.
right.
well whatever you can manage.
okay.
ehm could you move down from that point about three inches.
right.
could you move back from that point eh another three inches.
that's left.
that's left.
it's away from the edge of the paper.
mm okay.
right eh.
could you move.
oh.
could you move down from that point one inch.
right.
could you move back across to the edge of the paper again.
right the way across.
another three inches right again.
yeah.
okay.
can you move down eh three inches.
could you move to your left ah approximately six inches.
am i allowed to say if i'm going to go into one of these obstacles.
it's got right in the middle of the water.
six inches.
mmhmm.
right.
okay.
could you move.
you're going to be in the middle of the water.
but i'm not any more i've fixed it.
right eh.
could you move down approximately three inches.
okay.
could you move to your left approximately three inches.
right.
could you move diagonally down and to your left.
mmhmm.
approximately four inches.
okay.
could you move down from that point two inches.
right.
could you move left from that point approximately three inches.
no i'll be off the edge of the page again.
well to the edge of.
i'll go as far as i can.
the paper go as far as you can.
right okay.
could you move down from that point another three inches.
okay.
and could you finally move to your right two inches.
and that should be the finish point.
that should be the finish point.
well what's the finish point.
i don't know but that's where it i've got a i've got a cro--.
is it just got.
i've got a cross on my map here down near the it's down near the.
bottom left of the page.
bottom left of the page.
yeah.
have you got a tree there.
i'm at a chestnut tree.
you're at a chestnut tree.
right is that it.
is that all we have to do.
right.
start from the sandy shore.
okay.
moving down straight down.
how far.
down as far as the bottom of the well.
i don't have a well.
ah right eh.
move down eh vertically down about quarter of the way down the page.
move to the right in.
do you have local residents.
i do.
right.
well move up and round and above them.
okay.

eh okay.
right.
do you have a stream forked stream.
eh yes.
right.

round the bend.
round the bend.
yeah.
and stop.
do you have farmed land.
no.
right do you have a dead tree.
yes.
right eh.
move eh r-- to the right almost to the edge of the page horizontally across.
where in relation to the fork in the stream is this.
eh this is a-- the-- this is at the fork in the stream.
move right to the edge of the page.
yeah.
okay.
down about two inches and then back across avoiding the dead tree.
across the stream.
yeah cross the stream.
and stop right in line with the dead tree.
do i move in a v-- straight line from the edge of the page.
yeah.
right across the stream.
and stop right underneath the dead tree.
okay.
now move down about three inches.
okay.
then move to the left three inches.
do you have a lagoon.
yes.
right well go down and round to the bottom of the lagoon.
okay.
do you have treasure on your map above the lagoon.
right.
no i don't.
okay.
eh and move above a rock fall if you have it.
don't have a rock fall.
ah right.
well in that case move diagonally across to the left-hand side from the bottom of lagoon for about three inches then.
do you have a bay at the bottom here a large bay.
no don't.
not marked at all.
no oh yeah i do sorry aye.
aye.
where in relation to the the top or the middle or the bottom of the bay.
to the top.
okay.
and do you have a pirate ship.
yes.
right.
and just move from the very top onto the pirate ship.
right.
through the water.
yeah.
okay.
along and down and hit the pirate ship.
right.
that's it.
right.
do you see the start point above the stony desert.
aye.
aye.
ehm heading towards the left for about two centimetres 'til you reach s-- above a-- equal to the end of the stony desert.
aye right.
ehm then start sloping downwards to the left.
right.
towards the bottom so you should be about an inch from the top from the bottom of the page.
right.
ehm.
do you see the site of the plane crash.
no.
no.
oh yeah i do.
right up at the top.
oh.
no no.
no you must have another one.
right okay ehm.
he-- keep heading towards the le-- in a straight line towards the l-- the left of the page 'til you're about ehm an inch and a half away from the the left the far left-hand side of the page.
right.
and then start sloping up.
do you see the collapsed shelter.
mmhmm.
right ehm.
if you start sloping upwards slightly towards the right 'til you're about parallel with the top of the collapsed shelter but still oh about an inch and a half from the left-hand side of the page.
right.
so that should be about three and a half inches.
mmhmm.
right.
so then start heading towards the right of the page ehm over the top of the collapsed shelter about three inches.
right.
ehm so you should be just at about the end of the collapsed shelter.
aye.
right so go down to just down the side of the the down the right-hand side of the collapsed shelter 'til you're equal with about the bottom of it.
right.
now.
do you see the savannah.
aye.
right ehm.
it should be about if you s-- a slight slope upwards to the bottom of the savannah it should be about three inches.
aye.
right.
so if you just head up towards the bottom of the savannah.
right.
not underneath it though.
ehm.
right.
right mm.
do you see the slate mountain.
no.
no ehm never mind.
ehm once you get to the side of the s-- head up the left-hand side of the savannah about four inches.
right.
ehm now about an inch and a half back to the left.
right.
ehm do you see the hot wells.
hot springs.
hot springs yeah.
aye.
ehm from from where you are at the moment to about the bottom of the hot springs in a sort of d-- if you slope towards the bottom in a d-- uh the middle halfway you know underneath the middle of them about like a forty-five degree line.
aye right.
right.
right.
and now go to the left about an inch just un-- so that you're going under the hot wells.
right.
then.
another sort of diagonal slope downwards but ehm slightly steeper than forty-five degree line.
forty-five degrees for about an inch.
aye.
right.
ehm.
right.
then ehm.
do you see the white mountain.
mmhmm.
right.
well you want to curve up towards it but making where from where you are now so that it looks like the bottom of a basin curving up to the side of the white mountains it's about six or seven inches maybe not as much as that.
right i think so.
where is it i need to end up the left or the right side of the white mountain.
ehm the left.
right.
mm.
so go up the left-hand side of the mountain as if you were climbing it.
right.
and then ehm.
head upwards straight in a straight line to about two and a half inches.
past the round rocks.
ehm well yeah i don't have that so.
right.
just keep going straight up.
ehm uh do you see the lake.
uh-huh.
right.
if you start heading towards the lake in a straight line about three in-- just about three inches 'til you get to the the edge of the lake.
right.
then you're going round the lake in a clockwise direction.
right.
but not right round it.
uh-huh.
do you see the roman baths.
nope.
no eh never mind.
ehm just come round the lake and then as if you were heading back to the left-hand side of the page but but just if you just stop where you're parallel to where you started going round the lake about an inch down from there.
ah right aye right got you.
right.
and then do you see the where the antelopes are.
uh-huh.
if you just head down about three or four inches straight down and go down the left-hand side of them.
the left-hand side.
yeah.
right.
uh-huh.
just keep going straight down.
and then.
so you should be just underneath the antelope.
mmhmm.
then just.
go in a straight line towards the right about two inches and that's your finishing point.
right.
that's it.
yeah.
okay right.
i'm starting off from a-- above the caravan park.
mmhmm.

but continue past that.
so i'm going down below the picket fence.
right.
we've come down from a caravan park.
mmhmm.
"and we're doing a ""u"" shape."
mmhmm.
okay on the and then you're going to proceed north right.
"hang on where's the ""u"" shape just underneath the mill."
just underneath the caravan park.
no no.
yeah.
right.
"the caravan park is directly a-- above the the base of the ""u""."
above right.
you're a-- okay right.
right okay.
right right.
and you're going to come up and the old mill well my old mill is going to be on the right so your mill wheel and the picket fence is going to be on the right-hand side.
right.
okay.

right.
right.
and then turn and keep it on your left-hand side and the abandoned cottage.
right.

uh-huh.
"and then when you get to the abandoned cottage do a slight sort of ""c"" shape."

okay.
uh-huh.
and then.
past the m-- in between the monument and the cottage.
yeah.

right.
so you're coming down come slightly down sort of south.
mmhmm.
southwest or just slightly.
and then you're going to pass above a fenced meadow.
do you have a fenced meadow.
and my fenced meadow is away down the right-hand corner below the forest.
so you only have one fenced meadow.
uh-huh.
right okay.
well just continue on that.
"right you've done that ""c"" shape right."
"and as if you're going to do a very wide ""u"" now."
okay.
right okay.
and just ignore if you've not got a fenced meadow there then that's okay i do.
right.
there's nothing on my left i've there's nothing to my left of the abandoned cottage.
right okay.
right.
"but just do that ""c"" that ""c""."
"the ""c"" over the cottage."
yeah.
right.
and then.
"turn round and almost in a sort of big wide ""u"" and go back up again."
right.
uh-huh right.
and you're going to come up.
and you're going to have a west lake.

just just coming in at the base of it then.
yeah just at the base.
mm.
"and then follow the course of it round sort of a ""u"" an ""s"" shape."
"as if it's a very very big wide ""u"" so i'm going to avoid som--."
yeah.
so that i so i'm avoiding something at the p--.
well.
you've got a trig point do you have a trig point.
no.
no.
no.
right.

right.
right.
so.
you're going to do a sort of and just follow the contour of that lake round.
okay.
mmhmm.
until you're almost at the top of the east hand coast.
right.
mmhmm.
"and then turn back round again in another sort of ""c"" or top of the ""u""."
mmhmm.
right.
and then you're going to come straight down at forty-five degrees.
mmhmm.
sort of southeast.
see see sorry where i where i leave the top the east of the west lake.

am i going over the top of the farmed land.
you're going over the.
no no no.
you're staying well below that.
oh right.
so in between it would be in between farmed land and i have a trig point.
okay right.
right okay so it's just above the just at the just before the tip of that west lake but just at the east co-- just at that east coast.
s--.
right.
okay fine right.
yeah.
uh-huh.

mm.
and go straight up past it.
back up due north again.
mmhmm.
okey-dokey.
and stop when you're just past the adventure playground.
mm mm.
so i'm basically forming a rectangle here.
almost yeah.
right i'm at just to the right of the forest fire.
okay.
now go right.

the bottom of it.
uh-huh.
underneath it.
un-- go underneath it yeah.

'til i s-- see what you've got.
right.
right have you got limestone cliffs above where you are now.
no.

a lion country.
lion country no.
right can you go straight can you go straight north from where you are now to the bottom of the east lake.
um.

right that's fine.
okay.
now eh if you go follow the line of the lake follow the line l-- of the lake left.
going west.
right.
and eh just stop when you're just past the bottom like the corner.

yeah.
yeah but a little more to the left.
right okay.
right okay.
okay.
and then you drop down.
and do you have a bay.
i've got crane bay yeah.
yeah.
okay.
just drop straight down and trace along the crane bay.
to the left.
yeah.
right f-- right 'til um right 'til about there's a point just eh right 'til there.
right.
right.
i've got a whitewashed cottage.
have you got that.
mm-mm.
is it th-- right.
you come down and there's sort of it's got crane bay.
yeah.
"and above the ""c"" there's a point and to the left of the ""c"" there's a point."
is it the s-- what point is it is it the one.
"um right to the di-- diagonally up from the ""c""."
right okay.
okay.
and then you just you go left and down.

it's j--.
and.
i'm i'm.
underneath the diamond mine.
just straight due east from there.

i want you to go three inches past that going south in other words just to the level of that i mean not the trout farm.
to the level of what.
inches three south of the level of the trout farm going due south past the gold mine.
okay.
i've got a totem pole just about where i am now just about where you s--.
right.
i want you.
to curve underneath that.

on my map it's eh right to the go to the right.
mmhmm.
i think that's me at the finish.
just is there a site of the plane crash.
uh-huh i've got that i've got a site of plane crash.
well it's just below there.
just below that.
and that's it.
think so.
okay.
start off above the diamond mine.
okay yeah.
right.
now.
go south from the diamond mine until you are just above the desert.
so that's with the diamond mine on on your right.

so i continue and go below the fast running creek.
no.
go just until you go go below the diamond mine until just before the fast fast flowing river.
i don't have a fast flowing river.
you have a fast flowing creek.
i've a fast flowing running creek.
which is on the far right-hand corner.
mmhmm.
um.
so you have.

my right right okay.
you've got neither a graveyard nor a fast flowing river.
i've got a fast running creek.
okay right you've got a fast flowing fast running creek.

right okay.
erm.
well okay then right.
you've got a creek i've got a river.
yes.

yeah.
so do you want to just go along to your right.
okay.
and then go up and over the top of where the creek is.
right okay.
and then down south again.
okay.
down south again until just above the apache camp.
right okay.
and pass that by go to your sou-- southwest of the apache camp.

right.
take the southwest direction.
passing above it right.
now.
do you have a walled city.
yes.
and do you have a desert.
yes.
well.
pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city.
between them.
uh-huh.
so that's over the top of the walled city.
right okay.
okay.
but i'm that's not in a straight line.
oh that's fair enough.
right just just go between those two.
right okay right okay.
right.
right.

right.
and you follow a sort of curve ehm.
how do you describe the last south.
sort of from g-- go in a.
"an ""s""."
"sort of ""c"" shape to cover the bottom of a ""c""."
right.
from when you pass down below the walled city.
right i right wait.
"go in a ""c""-shaped curve."
right from.
right.
and then go between the flat rocks and the stone creek.
okay can you do that.
you pass in a pass.
right.
i i'm at the walled city right.
oh you're at the walled city.
right.
you're just above it have you come down.
i'm just i'm just come down.
uh-huh.
so i'm still at the parallel with the base.
right.
right.
right.
the carved wooden pole is right at my bot-- right at the bottom i've got a ghost town in between the walled city and.
between the walled city and what.
the carved wooden pole.
there's a ghost town.
right.
oh well i don't have this on my map.
so ehm.
do you have flat rocks.
yes.
in line with the ghost town.
mm more or less yeah more or less.
right then.
pass pass below the ghost town.
right okay.
but above the carved wooden pole and above the stone creek.
right okay.
right.
so between the ghost town and sort of like a forty-five degree line or something.
so you're just.
yeah.
well then just make sure yous you miss that uh-huh uh-huh.
right.
below the go below the wooden pole.
no.
don't go don't go below the wooden pole.
right.
so between the ghost town and the wooden pole.
uh-huh.
but don't go below the level of the stone creek.
right okay so i'm passing above the stone creek and i'm going up to above the flat rocks.
right.
no.
below the flat rocks.
right okay right i know what you mean right.
you got to p-- you've got to pass below the flat rocks.
okay.
right.
so you're taking a sort of north.
right okay i'm below the flat rocks.
right below the flat rocks.
yeah.
okay.
you want to veer ver-- to your right curve round to your right and go in a south south direction.
and do you have buffalo.
pas-- yeah.
got a saloon bar as well above that though.

right.
at about at the level of the top of the fort right in line with the top of the fort.
okay.
pass straight across.
no don't pass straight across right.
"just curve downwards in a a ""u"" slight ""u"" a very very very slight curve and then pass upwards in a like an upside-down ""u"" because you want to avoid the cattle ranch which lies between the fort and the buffalo."
there's a cattle there's a cattle ranch.
right.
there's a cattle ranch between your buffalo and your fort.
that's right.
right.
"so i've got to go along and uh over a ""u"" shape right."
so.
you've go up and over the cattle ranch.
and then to the along to the fort.
then down.
uh-huh that's right.
right hang on hang on right right.
and.

go down south.
and then do you have anything else between the fort and the cattle ranch.
no.
you don't.
okay then.
so just go south and then straight along underneath the fort.
okay.
emerging at the left-hand side of the fort and you've to finish opposite the base more or less opposite the base of the carved wooden pole.
i have to proceed.
but still to the left of the fort.
right.
so i just go straight up north.
right straight up north yeah.
and finish erm beyond the fort.
right.
and be at this at.
i'm above the fort.
at the base of the wooden.
to the left of the fort and level with the base of the wooden pole but not actually beside the wooden pole.
right okay.
right martin eh.
okay philip.
you have the missionary camp in the bottom right-hand corner is that right.
yeah i've got a start.
right.
eh if you take if you go about an inch exactly to the left of that and stop.
okay.
eh now you're heading diagonally down and to the left about two inches eh 'til you're within about three quarters of an inch of the bottom of the page and at the bottom left-hand corner of the missionary camp.
okay.
right.
eh to the left have you got gorillas at the bottom left-hand corner or a-- any sort of.
i've got a banana tree.
banana tree right.
okay.
erm if you head left about four inches 'til you're at the bottom left-hand side of that marker that should leave you within an inch of the left-hand side of the page and about three quarters of an inch up from the bottom of the page.
yeah.
eh curve round and up keeping a distance of about an inch from the left-hand side of the page.
uh-huh.
eh just a small curve and then a straight line.
are you at the bottom are you at the bottom left-hand corner of the banana trees or slight-- or just at the left of the banana trees.
um.
yeah i've just moved up to the left i'm now up at the the leaves of it.
right okay.
eh head up erm straight up about four in-- no about three inches.
okay.
have you got a rope bridge there.
yeah.
right.
just keep going up 'til you're horizontally level with the rope bridge.
horizontally.
level okay.
eh are you about an inch away from the rope bridge at the minute.
yeah okay.
just just over an inch.
mmhmm.
well head directly right over the rope bridge.
over the rope bridge.
yeah.
right okay.
eh now once you're at the f-- far right-hand side of the rope bridge.
uh-huh.
head down about half an inch just directly down about half an inch.
okay.
now on the right-hand side of your page slightly above the level where you're at just now have you got a waterfall.
uh-huh.
yeah.
uh-huh.
right you see the the vapour.
mmhmm.
at the water.
right.
head right from the point you're at just now and slightly upwards until you're about half an inch away from the vapour at the left-hand side of the vapour.
okay.
here i am.
right.
erm where are your lost steps in relation to the waterfall.
have you got lost steps there.
no i've got oh yeah.
directly above them away up at the top or quite near the top of the page.
ah right.
there are obviously two sets of lost steps then eh 'cause i've got a set of lost steps up and to the left of the waterfall about two inches away diagonally so.
yeah.
i've got fallen pillars.
right.
aye that's eh slightly further left than that again.
okay.
okay picture.
so there are there are lost steps between the fallen pillars and the waterfall on my drawing.
okay.
so on my drawing we'll be heading straight up between the waterfall and the lost steps.
on yours i imagine we'll just be going up in a straight line from where you are now about four inches until you're horizontally level with the fallen pillars.
mmhmm.
alright okay got you.
yeah here i am.
right erm now.
you're going in a a curve that's heading left slightly up and left going down to the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars from where you are now.
going down to the bottom left-hand side of the pillar.
sorry bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars curving round from where you are now down towards the bottom right of the fallen pillars.
oh yeah i see okay so i've just curved.
yeah got you.
okay right now it's just travelling underneath the fallen pillar the w-- the words fallen pillars about two inches the length of the whole entire drawing from one dot to another dot.
mmhmm.
oh.
eh that's about one and a half inches left so you should be at the bottom left-hand side of the fallen pillars now.
so you want me to curve round that yeah.
no just just a straight line.
oh yeah.
left underneath the fallen pillars.
okay.
now are you bottom left of the fallen pillars now.
yeah.
right.
erm right imagine you're facing erm the bottom left-hand corner of the page from where you are now.
i've got flamingoes just to my left.
right okay.
no.
there.
yeah tha-- my route kind of circles round nothing in particular so i i assume that's the flamingoes.
mmhmm.
erm i suppose you'll be curving round eh well head towards the bottom left-hand corner the of the page for about an inch.
mmhmm.
"and then perform a ""u""-turn as it were about and head eh."
okay.
round the flamingoes.
yeah.
okay.
then what i assume to be the flamingoes underneath and 'til you're facing back upwards again.
okay.
have you got ancient ruins in your drawing.
yeah a ruined city just up from me.
ah right.
eh is it bricks with three birds above it.
yeah that's the one.
right.
head from the point you're on now.
mm.
eh well where are you in relation to the left-hand side of the page just now.
i'm about mm an inch and a half to two inches away from the left-hand side.
an inch and a half.
well eh try taking.
eh could you make the the curve of the kind of circle you've got there a bit nearer the left-hand side of the page.
okay.
'til you're within about half an inch of it.
okay.
now head from the point you are now diagonally upwards until you're within a centimetre of the s-- leftmost seagull.
okay.
at the ancient ruins of the ruined city.
okay.
right erm.
right from that leftmost seagull erm or slightly to the left of it head straight up about three inches.
mmhmm.
i've got stones in my drawing about two inches from the top of the page a-- well about an inch and a half from the top of the page.
is it just like upwards and to the right of the ruins well your ruins.
just just.
just straight up from the s-- the the ruined city until you're within w-- until you've reached a point that's one and a half inches from the top of the page.
okay.
and stop there.
now have you got the white mountain in your drawing.
mmhmm.
well see how the left-hand side of the mountain comes down.
yes.
eh go about half a centimetre below that and draw a line from where you are now to that point there.
diagonally.
downwards.
no.
you should be moving along a horizontal line sorry you should be moving along a horizontal line towards the word wh-- words white mountain but stop before the picture of the white mountain.
okay.
that the words white mountain on mine are beneath the white mountain.
yeah that's right yeah.
right.
i'm about an inch and a half from the top of the page just now.
right that's fine yeah that's perfect.
so you want me to draw a point that's horizontal with the words white mountain is that correct.
yeah uh-huh.
okay.
but don't go actually under the white mountain you know.
no.
right you.
i'm just.
you should be at the bottom of bottom left-hand side of the mountain now.
yeah.
right if you head diagonally up and to the right to the peak of the white mountain over the drawing.
'til you're within about a centimetre of the top of the page now.
mmhmm.
yeah nice.
head back down again round the birds on the right-hand side.
if you got them there.
mmhmm.
yeah.
eh now.
erm come down to 'til you're about a centimetre away and horizontally level with the words white mountain at the bottom right-hand side of the mountain there.
okay.
eh have you got a soft furnishings store on your drawing.
no.
right.
well on my drawing that's about an inch below the white mountain.
mmhmm.
eh and you want to curve round and back between the white mountain and the soft furnishing furnishing shore store.
okay.
eh so if you draw a line just underneath the words white mountain eh heading towards the word white from where you are just now.
mmhmm.
curving round and heading back towards the word white but underneath it about a centimetre underneath it.
okay.
now carry on horizontally.
to the left about another inch.
mmhmm.
horizont--.
to the left.
uh-huh.
okay.
now you want have you gazelles.
yeah.
right.
if you head straight down to the bottom left-hand side of the gazelles.
mmhmm.
okay.
and then f-- going underneath the gazelles.
mmhmm.
go about two and a half inches to the right.
and that's the finish.
okay.
that's it.
right it starts directly above the crest falls if you go to the left of your page just to the edge of the crest falls.
mmhmm.
come south due south to the bottom of the page.
mmhmm.
go to the left of the page to about an inch from the end.
over the banana tree.
i suppose so yeah eh.
mmhmm.
go north to the level of the footbridge.
mmhmm.
go up and go across the footbridge and stop exactl-- right at the end edge of the footbridge.
above the footbridge.
o-- over the footbridge.
mm.
and stop right at the end of it.
there is a poisoned stream on mine but which you don't have.
right.
okay.
and so what you do is you come south immediately south at the edge of the footbridge oh for about for about an inch so that you're about an inch above the starting cross not actually above it you know but eh along and above it.
mmhmm mmhmm.
ehm then come then come to the right of your page to the level of the 'til you're d-- eh and g-- then go north just eh to the left of the old temple.
right so i come to just approximately the level of the old temple below it then up due north.
north to the left of the of the old temple.
go up.
mmhmm.
until you are about two inches above about an inch above the abandoned truck to th-- which should be to the left of your t-- straight north line.
i have a slate mountain as well in the way.
you have a slate mountain.
go round the slate mountain.
up.
go go--.
just go straight up past it.
yeah.
a curve just immediately round it.
and come and then come down and under the abandoned truck.
okey-dokey.
and stop at the edge of the abandoned truck.
to the left.
yeah.
just immediately after the abandoned truck.
o--.
now you don't have baboons so come dow-- come due eh south for about two inches just so that you are about an inch above your footbridge like.
if you know right.
mmhmm.
interesting route.
ehm go to the edge of your page.
mmhmm.
and y-- you can see your white mountain is above okay.
mmhmm.
go just due left of the white mountain and keep going right the way up a-- d-- until about the level of the bottom of the pyramid.
okay.
that's past the lemon grove.
past ye-- yes.
which i don't have.
okay.
ehm go to the right.
above the lemon grove which you don't have right.
how far.
at go t--.
go to the right until the edge of the pyramid and then duck over the pyramid.
mmhmm.
and come down and under the pyramid just u--.
coming round a circle.
mmhmm.
until the edge of the pyramid.
alright.
now you have a remote village but you don't have a cobbled street the cobbled street is directly above the remote village.
okay.
ehm.
so do you want me to come to the left-hand side of it or the right-hand side.
to the left-hand side.
if you could take a line due south eh and under the remote village.
mm okay mmhmm.
so you a-- you've you've come due south and then you've come east to the right of the page.
yeah.
so now.
in the middle i'm actually directly under the remote village at the moment.
go about an inch past it.
mmhmm.
"and ""x"" marks the spot."
ah where do i start ross.
the start is ah here it's due north of the crest falls at the bottom right-hand side of your page.
oh right i've got it see it anyway right.
right ehm go just beyond the crest falls to to y-- well it's my left anyway mmhmm i think it.
be my left as well.
t-- ah yeah.
to y-- to the we-- to the west then.
okay.
west.
come s-- due south to level at the bottom of crest falls.
how far do you west do you want me to go.
just beyond crest falls.
right okay yes.
due south to level at the bottom of crest falls.
that sounded like a long line ken.
just the bottom.
it's right ehm.
go right along to about an inch from the end of the paper.
right.
go north and go north due north and proceed east over the footbridge just over it stop at the end of the footbridge.
east over the footbridge.
yeah.
just stop.
right.
ah right.
do you have a poisoned stream directly east.
no.
right.
come due south from the edge of the footbridge straight south for about two inches.
two inches right.
just ehm just about an inch above the starting cross.
right that's okay.
then do you have the old temple.
yes.
right.
go east and go north west of the old you know go north just to the west of the old temple.
do you go m-- go right.

well see ah about an inch above the abandoned truck that is where you should be.
right okay.
now are y--.
go straight across to the abandoned truck and then come south so that you're just underneath it.
how far right to my my left.
go to your left 'til you're uh ah until you're level and then south so that you're just underneath it you should be above it.
so i do i go to the left of the abandoned truck.
you go to your left obviously yes 'cause that's where the abandoned truck is now south so that you're just underneath it and just go to the end of the abandoned truck.
right.
now do you have baboons.
no right do i do i i stop before i reach the abandoned truck or after i reach the abandoned truck.
stop after you reach the aba-- just just right after you've gone under it.
okay.
right okay right.
so i go back left again i keep going left agai-- i go down then i go left.
oh yeah.
you s-- you you keep goi--.
you go down and then you go left.
right an-- you you y-- right uh ye-- i don't suppose you've got the balloons the baboons.
right okay let me cross this bit.
i haven't got any baboons no.

right do you know where y-- y-- a-- go down about two inches.
okay.
right.
'til you're about an inch above the path that you took to the footbridge.

should b-- directly below me almost.
are you just you should have gone just right under the pyramid should.
right i'm right under it.
right exactly.
right.
come across a tad 'til you are a-- r-- roughly a centimetre from the white mountain if you take a line up but not un-- a-- y-- y-- you know as-- it-- so that your line is the same direction that you took the line under the pyramid.
mmhmm.
just take it a wee bit further across so that you'll clear the remote village.
right all right no problem.
right.
right.
i'm so i'm just above the white mountain.
you're actually above it.
mmhmm.
if you t-- if you take a line due south you're going to hit it.
all i want you to do is clear the remote village.
i have cleared it.
right the remote village is like ah four inches below the pyramid in this.
what.
yes.
you are just b-- you are just below the pyramid.
right.
a-- a--.
you've come out about a centimetre from.
right.
i'm in between the remote village and the pyramid.
are you.
uh-huh.
why.
because you told me to come under the per-- pyramid.
yeah.
you're under the pyramid.
okay right.
right.
but you haven't gone far enough across so that you're so that if you came south you'd hit the white mountain.
i have come across far enough now.
well that's wrong then.
right.
go go back so that you'll just miss the remote village if you come south.
right i've got you.
right.
ah so come down.
uh-huh.
come down just past the remote village.
right.
and go to your right.
how far.
just past the remote village.
"and mark ""x"" 'cause that's us finished a complete trial."
right.
right.
right that's it.
right.

yeah.
how far should i be beyond the apex of the curve.
well should be about an inch an inch and a half down.
right.
okay.
you've got.
and then horizontally.
down to the right about three inches.

i'm at the stop point just now.
ah right.
well go down two inches.
right.
see the dead tree.
yeah.
are you at the same level as that.

mmhmm.
now.
do you have a stone circle.
no.
you don't.
um if you move right along the bottom of the page until you're about quarter the way along the page.
the very bottom of the page.

what you want to do is move from the farmer's gate to the le-- from the left of the farmer's gate right and up until you're left of the ruined monastery.
so.
i go round the left of the farmer's gate and up.
uh-huh.
yeah and up.
up and right.
and straight up to the.
and straight up to the l-- right of the ruined monastery.
so diagonally.
mm.
that's me.
right.
now if you move over the top of the ruined monastery and left and stop at the end of the ruined monastery if you see what i mean the left-hand side.
okay.
and then move downwards a few centimetres and left.
how far.
er mm do you have a stile.
quite a bit up.
mmhmm.
yeah.
well.
what you want to do is move along until you are level with the left of the stile.
and then move up to the top of the stile so that you're on the left-hand side of it.
okay.
now.
if you move right so that you are level with the right-hand edge of the stile now and above it.
that's me.
uh-huh.
and then up.
do you have a popular tourist spot.
ah no.
no okay.
right.
if you move up a few centimetres and stop and then move right a few centimetres and stop.

ehm no.
you do--.
well.
i've got a dutch elm.
yeah well tha-- that's fine.
now.
if you can move so that from where you are at the moment diagonally until you're underneath the tree.
it's about just above the middle of the page on the right-hand side.
that's right that's right yeah.
so you have a diagonal line.
to whereabouts sorry.
just underneath the bottom of the tree.
right okay.
now.
if you can move around the tree so that you end up at the top of it on the right-hand side.
right.
now.
on this map there is a viewpoint a great viewpoint and an east lake.
uh-huh.
at the top.
uh-huh.

and then underneath that on the right i've got a rocket launch pad.
yeah.
on this one the viewpoint is underneath that and almost on the mid line maybe slightly left.
right okay.
right.
so.
if you can move from the where you are at the moment upwards and left so that you are just below the bottom of the lake and about midway along the lake.
so i'm going up the edge of the page.
mm.
you can move diagonally i reckon you could move diagonally 'cause you're going to be midway along the lake.
oh yeah i see what you mean.
no.
midway along from the left to the right not from like the top to the bottom if you see what i mean.
so i'm.
okay.
i'm at the.
right.
just take where you are at the moment.
right.
i'm at the top right-hand corner of the dutch elm tree.
of the tree yeah right.
um.
the lake on this map has a viewpoint.
uh-huh.
which is halfway along the bottom of the lake.
mmhmm.
and you want to move from where you are at the moment 'til halfway along the bottom of the lake.
okay.
diagonally about.
diagonally yeah.
and have you got a rocket launch pad.
no.
well.
it's underneath the right-hand point of the lake.
on the right yeah uh-huh.
so will i just sort of go round that.
so go round it.
to the left.
right okay.
and end up halfway along the bottom of the lake.
right.
okay.
right now.
if you follow the bottom of the lake along to the left.
mmhmm.
and continue doing that until the lake effectively stops.
and then it goes up and.
then it goes up.
yeah.
in a sort of a curve.
and if you can follow if you can continue to move left basing it on the line that you you're at just now until the left completely fini-- until the lake completely finishes.
mmhmm.
because there's a bit above you.
right okay.
so.
if you cn you can actually do that and stop then that's that's it finished.
okay.
starting off we are above a caravan park.
mmhmm.
we are going to go due south straight south and then we're going to g-- turn straight back round and head north past an old mill on the right hand side.
due south and then back up again.
yeah.
south and then straight back up again with an old mill on the right and you're going to pass on the left-hand side of the mill.
right okay.
okay.
and then we're going to turn east.
mmhmm.
not straight east slightly sort of northeast.
s-- slightly northeast.
slightly slightly yeah.
very slightly.
and we're going to continue straight along erm quite a wee dis-- a wee distance erm quite a wee distance right we're going to continue along on that course.
and then we're going to turn north again.
mmhmm.
and immediat-- well a distance below that turning point there's a fenced meadow.
but you should be avoiding that by quite a distance.
okay.
okay so we've turned and we're going up north again.
mmhmm.
continue straight up north.
mmhmm.
and then we're going to turn to the west on a curvature right sort of.
okay.
"""s"" bend and immediately below that bend there is an abandoned cottage."
mmhmm.
okay.
and we're passing above the top of that.
"we're going to continue in that sort of ""s"" shape a big wide ""s""."
mmhmm.
and on the sort of mmhmm top erm left of that again below it there's a fenced meadow.
but you're passing on the top of that.
okay.
right okay.
okay.
"we've gone from the abandoned cottage right and we're on the sort of ""s"" shape yeah."
right.
right.
"and then at the top of the ""s"" we're turning north."
mmhmm.
okay.
we're going straight due north.
at the top there there's a west lake.
okay.
which we're going to pass on the south erm southeast side.
mmhmm.
"and we're going to do that in a curve almost a half ""u"" shape."
"half ""u"" shape to the southeast."
yeah.
yeah the southeast.
right okay.
and continue up north slightly.
mmhmm.
but not quite to the tip of that lake.
mmhmm.
and then we're going to turn down ove-- above a trig point and we're going to turn immediately to your right and straight down at an angle of forty-five.
right.
okay.
and we're going to continue that wee distance down and that the point at the end of that it should be near to the abandoned cottage where we went past miles away but if not just carry on and then continue down in that forty-five degree.
mmhmm.
and turn round by a monument on the outside of the monument.
outside of the monument.
yeah.
and then a very slight turning up again north sort of northwest.
mmhmm.
"very slight curve sort of very slight ""s""-shaped just a slight curve and then going to proceed up north again."
on the right-hand side there's a nuclear test site before right before reaching the top of that northbound.
and then you're going to turn back west.
and above that there's an east lake.
oh right okay.
yeah.
