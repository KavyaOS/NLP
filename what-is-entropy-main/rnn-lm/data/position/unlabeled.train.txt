I started
my acting
career
I think is you start to meet more and
meet more actors in
the industry you'll learn that everybody has their own unique story about
how
they got started and
I'm no different I think my
story is pre unique
and
Ice didn't start the way lot of people did because I'm not one of those people that watch the movie or a play when
I was 5
years and was
mesmerised and wanted to
be an actor ever since I actually didn't do any acting when I was kid didn't any acting high school or in
college
I
actually went to college for computer science and engineering that was my major and that was my
degree in after I
graduated
I was working in the corporate world as a
software
developer I
actually worked
as software developer
for many years so I had a whole
nother life before I started
my acting career the way
I got into
acting
was actually because I was working in
the corporate world
I had job in this was in Cleveland Ohio so I grew up in Cleveland I went to Michigan for
college
and then I came back
to Cleveland for before my first
and he was actually photo of me my cubicle trying cool as
a software developer this was back I think I'll round maybe two thousand eight or something like which
is roughly when
I started
taking
acting classes
the way I got
into it was that me and my
best
from high school who is also working
a Corporate
Drive In Cleveland we would often
meet
up after work just looking for something fun to do after work with sometimes we can go to a
bar restaurant
for happy hour I remember we had even
attended a few Toastmasters meetings if you know what Toastmasters is
I also signed up for jiu jitsu classes for a. Of time back then and
at one
point we
having
to
walk by this acting studio in Cleveland Ohio and this was in April of
two
by Jessica was
teacher there the
head teacher there and
she also still owns and teaches at that school if
you are in Cleveland or
near Cleveland Ohio I highly recommend you check out her acting classes at the
hood School of acting
houde school
of
acting in
Cleveland Ohio for the link to them down in the description below I've actually interviewed
Jessica Hood Morris here on this YouTube channel about the
Meisner technique
which is an acting technique
that they teach at
that school
if you
want
to
watch that
interview all
put that down in the description below as well but anyways so me and my friend we happen find this acting school and we went to a free class to audit and looks fun
so we signed
for classes and
I remember when I signed up I had zero expectations in terms of
making
a
career
change in fact
there not a single
brain cell in my
head
was thinking that
I would pursue
acting as a career I signed up for those classes
I
would just stop
taking
classes the
next month
if
it
then
I would just
sign up for another
month and then another month and and just see how it goes well when I signed up in 2008 I actually
kept taking
classes there for
the next eight years so that's how much I enjoyed those classes in for that first year or it was again strictly doing it for fun
I
had
no
expectation of trying
get
an agent or make money or any of those things but the cool thing was is that that acting
class whether I knew
it or
at the
time I was gaining so much experience and so much knowledge while I was in there because it was that acting class that I made connections
was able to
get me
my
first
role in short film and
my first rolls in student filmed it was through that acting class that I got my first role in play
professional headshot and it was through
that
acting class
that I ended up getting my first agent the way I
got
that agent was because one of the
students in the class was
represented by an agent and she introduced me to her agent and that's how I got my first representation
that's also
what I tell people is the best way get an
agent is
through a
referral because that carries so more weight
than if you were to submit to an agent directly on your
own
that acting class gave
me so
many opportunities before I even
imagined getting the agent
or making any money
and part of reason why I never had the
idea of
potentially pursuing it a career was because I was
very naive
to industry before I
started taking
the classes
I thought
and
I
don't
I'm only one that thought this way I
think plenty of other people do
it specially people that don't really know about the acting industry at all but I just
assumed
that
that was made on
TV
was made in Hollywood I
assumed everything that we saw on our
TV screen any small
commercial or anything like
that I
assumed was made in Hollywood
I never even
considered that
local
commercials
for a
local company like
local car
dealership might be made locally I never consider that even though makes perfect sense that that would happen
but it took
me
being in
class to
learn these things
the way
I Learned was
that I
saw other
people
in class other
students in a class who had
agents
who
were auditioning
for these types things
and
would see
them on TV and that
was
amazing to me so that's how I learned about those things that local
commercials would be made locally and they would hire
local
actors
so when first
agent things
I
started on dishes in 4 to begin with because Cleveland Ohio is a very small market in terms of film television production
there
are zero TV show is being made
there at least when
I was there and there are maybe there might be one or two movies that come into town per year so when
I was there
99% of the auditions that actors
would get through
their agents
would for local
commercials or
for industrial videos
and
what
industrial videos are our videos
that are used companies for internal
use a
great example
of
an
industrial video is a
training
video so if you've ever had
a
job at
company and you watch the training video
on how do your job
those actors in those training
videos or acting in
industrial videos and I've done a ton of those when
I was
in Cleveland so that's
how I
got started that was my first agent and those were first types of things I started auditioning for when
I was when I got my
first agent in 2009 so this was about an a year after I started taking acting I was still working my
full-time job and
in fact I didn't quit my full-time job for a long time from 2009 through 2014 so those
four and
a half or so and 2013 beginning of 2014 for those four a half years I had an agent but I'm still working my full-time job as a software developer
and what I would do is if I got an
audition I would go
on my
lunch
break to do that audition
and then I will come back to work and then if I
ever
booked then I would actually
just take a day
off of work
and then do whatever
acting
job that
I booked
a weather at the commercial or
video or something like that and then
I
would come back to work the next day and I
did
that for
many years
I was working my full-time
job and then every once awhile I would have an audition and then everyone small I would book something
and it wasn't until 2014 that I decided that
maybe I want to try to do a little bit more
with acting so here's what happened at the end of 2013
I was just finishing up a 12-month contract
for my software job
and
come January of 2014 I had decision to make I could either take a
new contract for my software job or I can take a break and I elected to take a break at the time but my thought process was that I'm going to take 6 months off from my software job and try focus a little bit more on acting to see where that takes me and I
thought that I
can
do this because I
had saved
up some money and I felt I was in a financial and
the reason
why I say is because
when I
was working full-time
there were certain auditions that my agent was sent me that I would have to turn down because I was working
on
a high-priority project work that I
couldn't
leave
for I
couldn't take our
lunch break to go to that audition
and I definitely
couldn't take a
day off a full day off from
work
to go work an
acting
job when had this high-priority project at work
so there
were certain
times when I had to turn down auditions
and turn down bookings and
this gave me an opportunity in the beginning of
2014 to push my software job aside for six months to
see what I could
do if I focused
100%
on
my
acting
career my
thought
was
that I was going to
take it 6 months at a and if things started going downhill
and
I can always fall back on my software career and
go back to that
job well that was 20 14 now its 2020 and in the past six years
I have not taken another software job since then so I've been really lucky and really blessed to have been to been able
to fully focus on my acting career this entire time sure I've had side hustles and side gigs
to bring
in extra
income but besides that I've been
able to support myself primarily with
my acting career now
that's how I was able to
start my career in Cleveland Ohio but as many of you
I
currently live in Atlanta Georgia so
how did I end up here
well
back in 2015
so about a year after I took my
break from software
and started focusing a hundred percent on acting in 2015 I met two people from Atlanta to actors from Atlanta
are their names were Alan O'Reilly and Jenna kanell and
meeting them really open open my eyes to Atlanta
as a
potential
opportunity destination because remember
I
before
that I was very naive to the industry and I
didn't know that
you know local things were made in Cleveland Ohio well
even
after taking acting from 2008 to 2015 I was still very naive to the acting industry outside of my local market so I understood how things
worked in Cleveland and in
kind the surrounding
areas but
still don't really understand how the whole industry work outside of our Market
I
still thought that movies
and
TV shows were all made in Hollywood right
and
it
took meeting
Alan and Jenna
to tell me
that know there are
other cities
out there that have a lot of film and television
production and since they
were from Atlanta
they really opened my eyes to what was going on
in Atlanta
so when they told me about that I started researching it and that was when really
started
considering
moving down to Atlanta and
it didn't take long
after
that
only a
few months
later in 2016 was when
I
decided to make
the and come down here to Atlanta the reason I made the move was because when was in Cleveland Ohio yeah I
wanted to
audition
for
movies and television
shows
I wanted to work on movies
and
those opportunities just didn't exist are the video that I just made last week was about what's the city to pursue an acting career and where you live does matter because certain
cities have more film and
television production
than
wanted to audition
for
movies and
shows but there was just not that opportunity I might get one audition for
a per
year if that sometimes zero
auditions for movies
and death
no auditions for TV shows
the entire time that I was there
once I move to Atlanta a
much
bigger production
Market
a
lot of movies
and shows are made here I started getting auditions for movies
and shows
every week often multiple times a
week two
instead
of
one audition
for a
per
year it
was
an audition every
week for a movie so it
was very but it
was such a drastic change from what I was used to this move
to
Atlanta
next step that my career needed if you look at my IMDb profile
you'll see that all
of the movies and
television
shows that I've
worked on they've all been from 2016 onwards everything before that most of it was
just short films and
projects that worked on with my friends
so
this move to
Atlanta was a huge change
from
my career and one thing that want to mention is that this
entire
time since 2008 I
never stopped taking acting classes from
that
first
day forward
I always continue to take classes
I didn't stop
my agent
I
didn't stop when I booked my first job
I didn't stop when I got my first movie
or my first
television show I continue
to take acting all the
way through it but that's because
I
really believe in
I really
believe that actors need to
continue their training throughout their careers because there's always something
new learn there's always something
to improve and I feel like
that is a
huge
reason for the successes
that
I still take
acting classes is that I know
that I still
have
so room to grow
in my
career I'm nowhere near what I think my potential can be for example I just had my first lead
role
in a
feature
film that came out this month
so I have
so much more
to look forward to in my career and that's why I continue to train when move to Atlanta the
first
thing that I did was
I signed
up for more acting classes
in Atlanta so I really do believe in that when
I start to
look
back on
my career
as
a software developer
when I was sitting in a cubicle and staring at computer screen it feels like an entire
lifetime
ago now I would not trade this for
the world
I've had so many great
experiences up
until
now and I look forward to what the future has
to offer and I know so many of you that are watching this that follow my YouTube channel

in
the comments until next time keep
if you want to be cast in movie or television
show is really
important to
understand
exactly
how the casting process works
because the audition
is
not the only step in
the process as
actors we really
only know about the audition
because
it's
the only step that we are
directly involved in right
but
there are steps before and
entire
casting
process work what's on my fellow actors welcome to
the acting
career center to help you learn the skills you need to break into the film and television industry thank you so for spending some time if
this is your make

was in
the
show or it is an incredible show you don't even have to take my word for it I actually just
so go check out Cobra
Kai if you get a
and let me know down
in the comments
give me shout
out of the
refrigerator
how
the casting
process works
give you a
kind a high-level
overview of
the
casting process there are
specific
details
that different from
case
case from Project
to
but
I will give you a view
of how
in general
the casting
process works for movie
13
steps
that it takes to
cast a role in
movie or show and how
your audition kind fits into those steps let's
say
a
Disney movie movie
is
done
being written with
the writers of
finish
writing
the
script they now need to
cast
the movie
right so the
producers
now
need
hire
a casting director this is the
producers of the movie
to help the
casting director than take that script breakdown for those
roll a
breakdown
is just a short description of each roll inside the script
and
then
Step 2 is that the
casting
director will then send
those
breakdowns out to agent
sometimes those
breakdowns will be sent publicly posted
publicly as well
on sites like Afters access so that
individual
actors
and access most of the time for big budget movies and
television shows
they
go
directly to
ages and will not
be
posted publicly I would
say 95% of time
or more write
down to only go to agents and will not be posted publicly so that taxes can not access
them directly that's why it is so important that an after get an agent at some point in their career has
the breakdown
they will
then take them to their roster of all the actors
they
represent
in
C250
do it for
simplicity's sake in our example let's only focus on
one particular role because movie
script can have
50 or more
that needed cast
from
the lead all the way down
to all the supporting role let's just focus on one
person
that works in the coffee and the
description is 16 to
25
male
or female
so that's the
character
breakdown
breakdown I done look my roster of all the actors I represent repeat
that
break down okay and once I find that group of people all of those actors
that did
the
breakdown
by
then send
the headshot resume and demo reel of
all
of those actors in
a
casting director in a casting director here are all of the actors okay
so
we're not
involving the actors yet this
is communication between the casting director
any agent so far
is step three agent now sending all of the
actors they represent
back
to the casting director for a particular rule casting director has received all of those
headshots
resumes in demo
reel
they now look
at
all of these actors and
decide
which ones they would like to
see audition
now in
an
ideal world
every single after would get a chance to audition but
unfortunately in
the real
world there just isn't that much time available that's the
problem
have
enough time to audition
every single after that
wants to wash dishes because
think
about it we're only talking about one agent
here typically
a casting will
reach
out to dozens of Agents so in dozens of
Agents all
send
all of their actors that fit that particular coffee shop worker roll the casting director could potentially get the mission of hundreds or even thousands of actor headshots there's no way that the casting director can audition hundreds or thousands of people for that one role
because remember there are fifty other roles that need be
cast for this movie rights over this particular rule they might be able to see 20 or 30
answers
that means it's for each agency that they might only be
able to audition after or two actors
for each
agency this is why it
is
so important to have a
great
head shop because in this step the process how are you going to stand out casting director
the
is looking at a CD of hundreds
of
headshot
and they have to decide 20 or
30 out of all
of
those people that
they
want to see en
douchen so you have to
have a head shot
that really catches their eye really stands out for
decide I want
to
see this
person so
that is
Step 4 step
four
is the
casting
director selecting
which actor
they would like to see
audition and
then telling that
to
agent saying hey
thank
you for sending me all of these
actors
that fit this role here are the two actors I would like
to see audition please moving
on to
step five
step
five
is now the agent
now passing
that information to
the actor now finally the actor
comes
into play the
agent will
then tell the
answer
hey
you
got
an audition
and
here are the sides step 6 is the actor preparing for the audition
in this is the part
that we are all familiar with
as
after now we finally have the audition side we the role that
we need
audition for
and now we have time
to get
ready for the audition in my experience typically you have between 24 and 48 hours to prepare for
an audition
I will have
more
than an extra day very very rarely will I have more than four days to
prepare for an audition I
would say on average it's
about
48 hours now you might
be asking how can you prepare a really
really great audition
in
less than Forty-Eight
today
free 10-step audition prep
Racing cheat sheet that will help you nail your audition every
single time
so if want to
download sheet
you can get up and go to that
link right up there with prepared your
audition
step
7 is
actually
do the audition audition can be live and in person or what's a little bit more
common these days is doing a
cell tape which is reporting your
audition
at home
and then send to
the casting director Stephanie is the casting director reviewing every single audition from each of the actor
if they were in person
auditions
they
would
have
all been
recorded
in the room
for the casting director will wash all of those auditions back again or if they were self wash
all of those tapes at this
point
could
not
be call
Bast
depending on the
project
and
depending on the
roll
a call back
is
when
a
casting directors and bring back some of the actors that they really liked for
that
particular
role
to
give them a second round of auditions if an actor gets a call back that means are really interested in them for rule they
they've
been brought back not everybody
gets brought back call back they usually only bring back the people that they are
really
interested in now some auditions don't have all that sometimes they will just booked the actor off of the initial audition some will have one round callbacks some others will
have even
more
than
one producer sessions and
network test and all
kinds
stuff here is that there might be call back there might not be but just understand what they are in this process after the
callbacks
the casting director will then make their recommendations for each role of the
project the producers
so
that is Step 10 the casting director recommending their top or top
five
actors
for each
role to producers for a final casting decisions eleven the final casting decision now needs to be made it's important to understand
that the
casting director does not make the final casting decision they
may
have influenced but they are not
the
final maker for
a television show The Final Decision makers are the producers the
showrunner and the network Run movie It's
usually the
producers
and the director
the important thing is
that
it
is not
the casting director
the casting
director does have an important role in
the
beginning of the process because they select who they want to see audition so in a way they do
decide has a
chance
in the part but when it comes to the very end they don't make that final decision so that
was
step 11th step 12
is
once
a
final decision is
made the casting director then
extend an
offer
to
of that after and then
Step 13 is
the final step of the agent
then
passes
along that offer
to
the Acura and said hey after you have
just booked the role of
coffee shop
worker
on
this new Disney movie Behind the process any confusion about how this process work

to help you break into the film and television industry so you can create the acting career of your dreams my name is / you honored to be here with you today talkin
about the opportunities for
actors in
Atlanta but before we get started on that topic I got a few quick housekeeping notes to get to because I have not made a video in a long time so if you have been a subscriber to this channel for a while maybe
since
I started it back in 2014
first of
all
thank
you second of all I really apologize for
not
making a video in
a while but
one of the main reasons for my Hiatus is
Atlanta
my acting career has gotten really really busy after moved here to
Atlanta hence
the reason for this so
one you may have noticed is that the name of the channel has changed what used to small market
after is
now acting career center now part of the reason for the change is
actually Atlanta because
I no live in small Market I moved from Cleveland Ohio to Atlanta Georgia back in 2016 and
Atlanta just
happens to be one of the biggest film and television production cities in world right
now
which
we will talk about later so small Market actor and small Market actor.com or
no more and in their
place we now have acting career center and acting career
and I think this name this new name the channel is
Ashley a better reflection of what I am originally intended for it be anyway because what I really wanted to do with
this channel in beginning
was to
help educate
people to help to help people who were newer actors were new to the industry who
wanted to make this career but didn't know
how to and
I've been working after since 2009 and in
that time I've gained so much knowledge and so much experience that I
hope to
to share with you too hopefully you know lead you down the right
path limit your
mistakes so you can continue down this road of becoming a working professional after because like I know it can hard at times it can be and it can be frustrating at times if you if you're an actor who's been plugging along and feel like you've made no traction look I get
it so I'm doing this to hopefully inspire you to show
you that if someone like me can do it if this for software developer a guy who didn't study acting High School didn't study acting in college I didn't take my first acting
class
until
I was
26 old guys
if someone like me can do this
then you can absolutely do this too as long as you're willing to work hard you're willing to study and learn not just the craft
acting
but also the business of the industry and you're willing to be a professional in every sense of the word if you're willing do those three things then I've no doubt that you have got a shot and making this your career
and that's exactly
why I made this channel the acting career center to help you do just that if that sounds like
something
you want to learn more about then take subscribe to this channel if you haven't already and leave me comment down below if you have any burning questions leave me question down below that
I could possibly
answer for you in a future video okay
all
right enough
keeping
stuff let's talk about Atlanta so back in 2015 when I was still living in Ohio I really had no idea that the film and television industry even existed down here in Atlanta and
that it had already been here for years and was growing year after year and
the thing that really propelled Atlanta this is just like a tiny little history lesson the thing that really propelled Atlanta to becoming what it is today was back in 2008 tax credit was passed the state that gave production companies a huge financial incentive to bring their projects to Georgia and
after that happened there was it
didn't
happen overnight
but
year after
year the film industry grew and grew and grew to
the where now
in 2020 I
want get this number right film and TV has grown become a nine point five billion dollar industry
in state of Georgia in 2016 this is a crazy fact the year than I moved to Atlanta in 2016 there were more major feature films
made in Georgia
than California
what Mina
with me when first heard that California that's where Hollywood is and you're telling me more movies were made in Georgia than California is true in the movies made
Georgia aren't some obscure films that you've
never
heard
of day are some of the biggest Blockbusters in theaters year after year including the highest grossing movie of all time Avengers endgame shot in Georgia down in Pinewood Studios just south of Atlanta so
let me give you a made in
Georgia
in
the
past
decade
you
ready
for this
okay
Avengers Infinity War Avengers endgame black panther Ant-Man Ant-Man and the WASP
Spider-Man homecoming Venom Captain America Civil
War Guardians
of the
Galaxy Vol 2 hidden figures Sully passengers Godzilla king of monsters
Fast
Five Furious
7
the
fate
I
Tonya the accountant bad Moms Christmas Hunger Games Catching Fire Hunger Games Mockingjay tag doctor sleep baby driver Pitch Perfect 3 Zombie Land to
Richard
Jewell oh and many many
many
more oh
wait I didn't even mention a single television show all right here is some of the shows that were made in Georgia
in past decade
The Walking Dead stranger things the resident The Vampire Diaries The Originals Ozark Watchman Atlanta Dynasty Black Lightning insatiable Cobra Kai MacGyver Lodge 49 The Haunting Hill House Doom Patrol Halt and Catch Fire the gifted star
and
many many many more including all of Tyler Perry's movies and television shows
being
shot in his massive 330-acre Studio Lot right the heart of Atlanta yeah so
all of that
has
happened all of that and
has in Georgia in the past decade
basically since 2008 crazy crazy so okay now back to our original question for you should you as an after move to Atlanta for your acting
career well
ultimately that's a very personal question right is not the
question
that I can just say yes or no to because it's going to different for but what I can do is provide you with as much information as possible to hopefully lead
you to
make a better-informed decision that's right for your exact situation
okay factors
that I think you take into account when you're deciding whether or not you move to Atlanta
for acting first of all if
you're still worried about Atlanta being too small of a market compared
to
Los Angeles or York if you're still worried that you may not get enough opportunities in market
like even
though I just
gave you that giant list of movies and television
shows
that were being
made here
if that's your main concern let me put that to rest
right now
I
want to share with you my story might number of auditions that I've been getting for film and TV since I've been here at the time go all way back to 2011 so I'm going to you number of film and TV auditions that I have received year after year since 2011 which was back when I still lived in Ohio and then I'll bring it all the way to 2019 last year so
for the past three living in Atlanta all right you're ready in 2011
the number of film TV auditions I
got
one one total the whole year 2012 0 20130 2014 320 15 7 2016 all right 2016 is when I move to Atlanta got my first agent in Atlanta number of film and TV on Dish's I got in 2016 76 2017 105 2018 92 2019 110 wow I mean that's all I can that it's kind of mind-boggling that I went from getting just a
couple sometimes zero film
and
TV auditions in whole year to
getting over a hundred a year I mean in 2019 on 110 film and TV auditions in a year that's one every three days that's
crazy to me so when I
say that the amount of opportunity in Atlanta is huge
is
almost
mind-blowing I'm not exaggerating at all
so if you were an actor that's thinking about moving to Atlanta and your biggest hang-up is wondering if you're going to get enough opportunities I want to just just forget that
and also if there's anyone telling you that you have to move to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career they're just wrong the wrong
they don't know what
they're talkin about
look I'm not saying that Atlanta is the only place you can go I'm not saying that you can't go to a Los Angeles but just want you to know that there other options available and Atlanta just happens be one of the best options okay so then the
next question that
a
lot of
people have
when I say
all these
crazy
numbers and I'm
getting all these
great opportunities people will ask what does that mean Atlanta is better than Olay well that's an even tougher question answer because better is going to different for everybody situation again
what's
better
for
me may you
may not
be better for the next person so again you're going to have to figure
out exactly what you're looking for will your specific situation is and then whether Atlanta or LA or New York or any other Market has the best things offer you I will say this though I do think if you are an actor who is just starting out who is new to the industry and who who is just trying to get their first few credits I think Atlanta is better option than La I actually think Atlanta might be the best option in country for an actor like that may be the best option in the world
and I'll tell why there are
in my opinion fewer barriers to entry in Atlanta what I mean by that I mean that you will have more access to the things that newer actors are always trying to get which is get an agent which is start getting auditions and just start getting out there and trying to book rolls it is not uncommon for an actor in Atlanta who is brand new to the to be able to get an agent in their first year in first few months of being here and start auditioning immediately for big TV shows and big
movies
so I do think a newer after coming to Atlanta versus and you
were
after in
the same situation going
to
La I think that actor in Atlanta is going to have an easier time getting an agent is to have a little bit of an easier time getting auditions getting their first few auditions and is going to have a little bit of an easier time probably booking there for few jobs so the no there's a few reasons one is that there are there there are just fewer actors in Atlanta so a little bit less competition now that's not to say there is there aren't that many actors in Atlanta there are a ton of trees here and there are more moving here day by day but compared to La Atlanta's nowhere near saturated as a market like Los Angeles another factor is that like I mentioned before it's not uncommon for an agent and a pretty good agent in Atlanta to sign an actor who doesn't really have that much experience who to sign them right out the gate and start giving them auditions start giving them opportunities whereas in Los Angeles now. Lauder I've never lived in Los Angeles but I've had friends that live there and I've heard their stories and from what I hear that situation that I described for an actor in Atlanta that doesn't happen in La what's more common in La is that agents want to see legitimate film and television credits mostly television credit on your resume before they're willing sign you which puts new Rafters and kind of a catch-22 of well how do I get credits before I have an agent and then how do I get an agent before I have credits it kind of doesn't
make sense
so for those reasons it does it is a
little bit easier for a newer actor to kind break into the industry here in
Atlanta compared to
the some the bigger markets like in LA or York another factor that would make Atlanta a more
desirable place
and this goes
beyond you were
actors is that the cost of living in Atlanta is a lot
better
than the cost of living in Los you probably already heard the stories of how how expensive it is to live in
a
place
like Los
Angeles Los so
I just pulled up the numbers
of the median rent in La for a one-bedroom apartment is the median rent in La for one-bedroom apartment is now the median rent in Atlanta for a one-bedroom apartment is so that's like a $800 difference there that's not to say different neighborhoods are going
to have
are going
to be higher or lower in each City but this is just on average are going to be paying lot less for the same thing in Atlanta for your living situation then in Los
Angeles
also
if you're looking to buy a place the medium the median home price in Los Angeles is and the median home price in Atlanta is so that is just
more
affordable to live here all
these myself is
example
I can
afford to live in this place I've
been fortunate enough to buy my place here in Atlanta
and I
would not be able to afford a place like this in Los Angeles it would cost many
times more than
I paid
for here and I've actually heard many stories about actors in Los Angeles who blew through all of their Savings in less than a year and had to move back home because they just weren't ready for how much it actually cost to live there and is the people that are living there and haven't move back home it feels like they're spending all of their time working just trying to make enough money to pay rent and live in survive and they don't have money for acting classes and they don't have money for headshots and don't have money to actually pursue their career because it's so expensive
to
live
in that City
again I
haven't
lived there
so
I
can't do a
apples-to-apples
comparison but I
will say
I feel
very financially stable
where I am right now in Atlanta okay really her I said that it was easier for an actor in Atlanta to kind break into the industry compared to that same actor in Los Angeles and I want to make a distinction I want to make it very clear that I'm saying it's easier not easy it's certainly not easy to break into this industry no matter what
Market you're in so I don't want to make this
sound like a
l
a
bashing
session I'm certainly not saying that
there's anything wrong with LA
or there's anything bad with LA
there's just these differences and there are certain reasons why someone may want to go to La instead
of Atlanta to let's talk about a few of those first
of all and
this is
kind a woo Hollywood thing
but
Hollywood
does have this kind of Mystique about it Hollywood does have that I mean there's this though the Romantic idea of going to Hollywood to pursue your dreams is an after right it it's that if that dream that every kid has Growing Up So if you're in love with that
idea that that
story that that
story that lalala
presented
to in that movie if you're in love with that then there's probably there's probably nothing that I can say anyone
else can say to tell you to go to a different Market because Atlanta certainly is La it's it's different
it's got its
own great things about
it but it is in that City so if you're in love with that idea of pursuing your career in Hollywood and bio meets go do that because no other city is going be able to give that to you another thing the lifestyle the lifestyle in La
is just that's another
animal in itself and if that's something that you desire if you love that weather if you want the same 65 to 70 degree weather year round if you want get out there on the beach and surf if you want to
if you
want that
potential opportunity to
run
into
a Warner Brothers executive at coffee shop on a Saturday
morning
La you got to go to
La for that right now here some real legitimate things for for actors
career-wise
sitcoms if your if your thing is sitcoms and you think you're an after that will that will really thrive in a sitcom and you want
audition
for sitcoms you got to go to
La there are no sitcoms being shot in Atlanta right now none at least in 2020 there's not being shot here right now same thing with soap operas no soap operas in Atlanta if your thing is you want
be on a soap opera and you want to pursue that
above everything else and got to to La there's no question about it there's there there were soap operas in New York but I don't think there are any of their now either so you really just got to go La for that another thing I want say about a late is that from you
or actors I'm not saying and were after should
never go to La I think Atlanta is best option for a actor trying break into the industry right now but there's no reason to to think that you can't come to a Atlanta and start your career off here and if you start gaining some traction and start booking and start building credit on your resume and really start making getting a good demo reel together maybe
at
that point
maybe that point
is when you go
to LA because
now
you'll be more desirable to two agents into casting in place like Los Angeles
rather than the the hordes people that
move there every who
have
zero experience
so the last thing I'll is that
I've been in Atlanta since 2016 I
have no plans on moving to La anytime
soon
I have no plans on moving to New York or
anywhere else for that matter I
I really love it here I love my situation here I love my agent I love the auditions that I'm
getting I
am booking I'm getting to work on sets of some big huge movies and television shows every
year
and I
can afford
to own a
home I can also
afford to rent a office space for my photography
there's one more thing that about Atlanta I'd have always tell people I the community here just from the top down from the actors to the teachers to the agents to the casting directors to just everybody in the community here in Atlanta in this industry is so supportive of one another and wants to see each other succeed I just it warms my heart thinking about the actors here in Atlanta and how much they are cheering each other on it's great and again I've never lived in Los Angeles or New York or another big acting Market but just from accounts from friends of mine I don't hear them saying the same
thing in
those cities
and when I've met other actors that have moved here from the bigger markets that have moved Atlanta they the same thing that they see something different about the community here and how supportive of it is of one another so I love that about Atlanta and I think that is a huge plus if that's something that you value then really consider
Atlanta all right that's about
all I to say I know that it might have sounded a little biased because I live in Atlanta but I'm certainly not trying to convince any you want to move here but if you're in position where you're thinking about moving to another Market all I want to do is give
you information
and then you
do with it what you will because that's what happened
me
in
2015 when I was still living in Ohio I no idea that there was even film and
television industry down here until someone
told me about it and then I researched it and I ended
up here A year later and hey if you
do
moving to
Atlanta

audition

what are
your acting goals and your answer to that
question
is asked going determine whether or not you should continue watching this video because look if you're acting goal
is to make acting your hobby if you're acting goal is to just have lot of
fun
with it and go
make some fun
movies with your friends
shooting
up with your iPhone
and put them on
YouTube
that's
great and if you want to do that then you can go and do that right now you don't have to take any more steps to do that it's like me with the tennis I really enjoy playing tennis and I like going in playing tennis with my friends and having
fun
doing it I have no desire of making tennis my career I have no desire of pursuing
tennis
professionally right so I have to take any future steps same thing with acting if you
just
want to then
you
can go and do that right now if however you want make acting career if you want to go anything further than doing
as a
hobby if you wrote down in comments you want do you want to work
on big movies
big television shows you went work on Netflix
or Disney or a be or anything like that if you want to win an Oscar right
anything
beyond it being a
hobby than you
do
have to
take some necessary
steps
the
first step
to starting an acting career is to take
acting
and there are plenty of
acting classes that you can take here's list
of some classes I would
recommend you can write these down if you want technique classes
scene
study classes
improv classes on camera pause his voice and movement accents and dialects
weapons and combat script analysis and
audition classes now that I would recommend any actors start with this is the very first step
that
every single
actor must take
and
it
cannot be skipped
you
cannot skip taking acting you can't
just get an agent to start auditioning for movies and television shows it doesn't
work that way and it's not because you're not talented it's because you got to
give
casting directors
and agents and
actors and of reason
trust
show them that you're serious about this as your career
I'll use an
example
here let's say you were playing a sport and you broke your and you needed surgery and I came and told you hey I'll
do the
surgery for you I never went to medical school I never learned to do a surgery but I'll do
for you I'm
confident that I'll
do
it
are you
to
trust
me to perform surgery on your arm with the dumbest thing I've heard or would you trust someone who went medical school that's the point here you got to give him a reason to put their trust in you to cast you in their project that is only one benefit of taking acting another huge
benefit of acting
classes is that it will build your network in this career the more people that you know the more people that know you the more chances that you will have to succeed and to move forward in his career because you're building a community when you go to acting classes
I
can't tell you that
a fellow student in an acting class emailed me and hey I saw this audition that you fit and they sent to me and they told
me
to
submit
to
it and I've done this for other people to I seen auditions that would fit
a friend
of mine and I would send it to them and tell them hey check this out you should audition for this project and it's not the students in the class is your teachers to I've
gotten so many opportunities for
my acting teacher has a bunch of my IMDb credits for movies came from projects that acting teachers were other students recommended that I audition for in that I eventually this is the real power of of a network and a network that you can build by going to acting class this is why I've continued to go to acting class for 12 years I've been taking acting like every single year at my entire career because I know how how much it benefits my career and it's not just the stuff that I learned in class improving my
technique
and
proving
my acting ability which is
extremely
important but it's
also the
network but
I'm building the
community classes The Next Step every actor needs to take especially
if they want start
auditioning for anything is to get a professional
headshot your headshot is your most important marketing tool as an actor it's the extremely important to make a first impression is another just
you're trying to
pursue acting professionally then you
have to get
a
professional
headshot if you
want
agents
and casting directors
to
take you seriously then you have to show them that you are taking your career seriously you
want
them to have
confidence in you and
you can't give them
a picture that was taken on your eye so how do find a good headshot photographer well ask the people in your acting class that's another great benefit
of
your acting classes that you have people to
rely
on to give you advice I can tell you who
are some headshot photographers where I live in
Atlanta but if you don't live where I am you're not
going to come all way here
to take
head shot so
you
were going
to
want
ask
the people that in your
city
who you can go to to get a great
headshot
to a great place to ask is
in
your
acting class so those were
the first
any auditions you got go to acting
class you got to get a professional headshots now let's talk about three more steps that every single actor needs to take the first one is to start finding auditions on your own and start auditioning for project you got to be able to do this yourself before
you get
an agent to do it
for you and nesse
after that is learning how to self tape so most auditions these days will request you to record your own audition at home instead of going live and in so you got learn how to record it at home and that's called a self tape you got to be able to do that as
get
professionally have
is most auditions for big movies and television shows you will never be able find on your own as an
two agents and for the agents
to pass on to their actors last year I was able to find
I think five or six auditions for big movies and television shows by myself on sites
Actors Access and you how many my
agent found
me over
a hundred
so I was able to find five or six but my agent found a hundred more for me so that's why it's so important at some point in career that you will need to get an eighth so those are three more steps that you will
need to take I'm
not going
to go in-depth into
each of those because I actually have
individual videos on each of those three topics I have a video on how to find auditions on your own and submit to them I have a video on
creating a great self tape at
home
and I a video on four ways to get a talent agent so I'll put links all three of those separate videos down in the description below I will also put a link down there for another video that's called the cost of an acting
career and in that video I
break down how much each of these things that we've just talked about will typically
cost
you so how much you should expect to pay for acting classes for headshots how much you should expect
it to pay an
so will
in the description
the last thing I to share with you today are few words
of inspiration
and encouragement
and
those words come from those words come from
the answers
to
my two questions
earlier on in this video why do you want be an actor and what
your goals are for
this career lien on those answers anytime the going gets tough in this career because it will for the faint of heart there's
going to a lot of
got it in you talk to any famous actor right now
and
they will tell you there have been times
early on
in their career where they thought about quitting every single actor in this career thinks about quitting and we need to push through that we need
a never-give-up
and one
way that
you can make sure you don't give up is that any time that you start feeling low
and
feeling down about this career
is always think
that
to why it is that you really want to become an actor and
think about those goals that you have for yourself and keep pushing forward all
right that's it for today's video if you liked please
give it thumbs
up and
if you have questions leave those down
in the comments
below if you haven't subscribed already make sure to do that right now and
until next time
keep practicing keep learning and
