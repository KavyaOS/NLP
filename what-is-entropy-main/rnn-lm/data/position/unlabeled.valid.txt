recommend
every after do before every single live audition that will help boost
their confidence and reduce
their nerves let's talk about it what's my pillow mattress welcome to acting career center to help you learn the skills you need to break into the film and television industry my name is heard you thank you so much for spending some here with me today if this is your first time here make that hit that subscribe button to get more videos on acting auditioning and career advice every single

audition I
totally
understand that
at the making of this video
we are still in a global
pandemic
and most if not all auditions are currently self tape and there no live auditions right now however I do expect that to slowly change and live auditions to slowly come back especially live
call
backs that being said we are getting
live callbacks on Zoom
meeting
were
talking
to someone live
but we're
not in the room with them live
right
and
what we're going to be talking about today still apply nice to the zoom
call
backs as well do what is it that every actor be doing before their live
auditions it's not just to prepare for the audition
that's
obvious we
have
to prepare for the audition
and
prepare for the
scene
of research that
role
in
research a character all of that
stuff needs
to happen this
is something extra out if you're interested in learning how to
prepare for the role
all of that other stuff then I've actually created a 10-step audition preparation guide that I call my audition cheat sheet if you want

but today what we're talkin about is
everything
after
you
prepared for the role
you rehearse
your learned
the lines
you've learned the scene
and
all
have
to do well this last
step that
you should do
before going in for live
audition will
help boost your confidence and reduce
your
nerves let's
talk about a little bit about why we get nervous at an audition as after is the reason
we get
nervous it's not necessarily
the lines we do worry about
forgetting lines right
but it isn't the lines that makes makes us nervous what
makes us nervous is the
situation that we have to perform our life that
What Makes Us
nervous is walking
into that audition room and seeing that casting
and see my
camera recording
us and then
having to perform
in
front
of them there's a lot of pressure there that's
what
makes us nervous
because
think about it when
you've rehearsed your auditions
in the past
and I I've
done
this
and you
practice them and maybe you've done them 10
times in a you
did the
lights
10
times in row
or
20
times
a row and got it
right
every single time
and
you did while you
know in your living
room
at home and
then you drive to
audition
and
while you're the
car you
run through your lines
again
ten
times
20
times 30 times
in a you did it perfectly
every
single time and
then while you're sitting
in the waiting room for the audition maybe you run
through the lines
in your head 10
20
30 times
again
you're doing
perfectly
but then go casting directors there
that
cameras on
you they call Action
you're
under pressure all of a sudden
you get nervous
and now you start
forgetting those lines
