<43> what
<70> you have to
<69> do now is to not just
<40> practice
<70> lines but practice the situation what I mean by that I mean
<48> practice this
<78> scenario of
<69> the
<70> audition to put
<43> yourself
<70> in a mock
<69> audition and practice
<70> the pressure of
<52> auditioning
<70> so that when you do go into a live audition you
<69> don't feel as as
<70> you
<69> feel more
<70> confident this is very similar to professional sports where someone who has played
<43> basketball their entire lives and
<70> knows
<43> how
<70> shoot free throws and it's really good at
<67> shooting
<70> free they may not be able to perform well in a pressure
<40> situation at
<48> the end the game with
<70> fans
<40> screaming
<70> at them are they going to be to
<67> shoot
<66> their
<69> free throws as well as if they were shooting
<70> by themselves in
<40> the
<43> gym probably not because it's a different situation
<70> there under pressure right and sports teams will do
<43> mock
<70> pressure situations to help their athletes
<48> prepare blasts
<43> loud
<70> music while people are shooting her free throws
<69> or things like that right
<70> so this is something we can
<43> do is
<79> actors as well
<70> as the practice the situation
<43> now
<70> I think I
<43> talked about
<70> this
<43> in another
<70> video possibly
<40> multiple
<43> other
<70> videos
<43> but
<70> I do
<69> think this is such an
<78> important topic
<69> that it does deserve
<42> its
<70> own
<43> video
<52> so how can
<70> we practice
<43> these
<70> pressure situations where one thing that you can do is to record yourself record yourself performing the
<69> audition because when we practice just
<70> sitting on the couch
<52> or
<70> practice well drive to the audition in our car there's pressure there because we're not being
<43> recorded when you
<39> set up a camera and
<70> record yourself all send that changes something in you because you know
<43> that you
<70> have to perform because
<40> something
<70> is recording you this helps
<43> this helps over the nerves of having that camera
<70> in the
<43> room because one
<70> of the
<43> things that makes us
<70> nervous is when we walk that
<43> audition room
<40> we see that camera pointing
<43> to
<70> her face
<66> that
<39> makes us nervous but
<66> if
<67> you
<43> get used
<40> to
<39> recording
<67> yourself and get used
<43> to that
<70> camera on
<43> you
<40> all
<67> the time
<40> then
<43> when you walk
<40> into an
<43> audition
<70> and you have that camera on you it's going to
<69> make you as
<42> nervous
<43> going
<70> to feel more confident right now.
<69> don't have to have
<70> fancy
<43> camera to do this most of us have a phone that can
<70> record so record
<40> yourself
<52> with a phone set your phone
<40> onto a tripod
<43> adapters that
<70> can just hold your phone if you don't have it if you don't have a tripod my recommendation is to buy one it's one
<40> of best
<67> purchases that
<70> you
<67> can make for your
<69> acting career you'll
<70> get so much
<43> use
<70> out of your tripod for self taping auditions
<43> a
<70> special but this is another
<67> way to
<70> use a tripod
<69> is
<70> to use it
<67> to
<66> hold
<70> mock auditions to help you practice
<67> for your
<70> live auditions
<69> now there's two big
<42> benefits to
<43> record
<70> yourself
<43> we've
<40> already talked
<70> about one of them which is you're getting used
<43> to that
<52> camera
<70> recording you so
<40> that when
<51> walk
<78> into an
<42> audition
<69> you're
<70> totally used to having that camera there
<69> the other
<70> big benefit of recording
<43> yourself
<70> is that you
<43> can
<70> watch it back and evaluate and see how you did
<69> some people will
<70> say well can do that while practicing in front
<43> of
<70> mirror I discourage people from using a mirror practice their auditions
<40> because you're never
<70> focused 100% your performance when you practice
<43> in
<40> front
<70> of mirror when you
<66> press in front the
<67> mirror you're
<69> about
<39> 50% focused on your performance and
<40> 50% focused on evaluating it when
<39> you
<40> record yourself
<70> you can devote a hundred percent
<43> of
<70> your
<43> focused on your performance and then stop the recording and then walk around and watch it
<70> back and then you can devote
<40> 100%
<43> yourself
<70> instead
<43> of getting in front
<70> of
<67> a
<40> mirror the other
<70> thing that you'll notice is if you record and watch it back you
<43> may see things
<70> that you would not have picked up on
<67> had
<40> you not
<43> recorded yourself using
<70> myself as an example
<67> when
<40> first got started and
<70> I was recording
<69> myself practicing an
<70> audition I noticed
<69> that I was kind of swaying
<70> back and forth and
<43> subconscious thing that I was
<70> doing and I knew
<43> I
<70> had to correct that had I not recorded myself and had I just gone to
<43> my audition
<40> I probably would have that unconsciously
<70> at the audition and
<52> I would not have
<43> known
<69> and
<43> thought
<52> I
<43> did
<70> a great job right for them a
<43> casting
<70> director will watch that back and sit and why was he
<43> swing back and forth the
<70> whole time so that's a huge benefit of recording yourself have an S thing that you can do to practice an audition
<69> scenario
<48> is
<51> to
<78> basically
<70> role-play
<43> that scenario
<70> get
<43> someone
<70> to help
<43> you with
<70> this get
<43> a
<70> family member or friend or
<40> a fellow actor that
<43> you
<40> know
<43> to
<67> help
<70> you basically
<43> roll play the audition have
<40> them play
<39> the role the
<69> casting director and you're going to
<43> basically play
<70> play yourself as
<43> you
<52> walk into an
<79> audition they're
<52> going to be
<43> operating
<52> the
<43> camera and recording you
<70> saying
<40> the lines as your reader
<70> right and
<42> this
<69> again
<39> will
<70> help you get used to that situation
<43> of
<52> walking
<51> into that audition
<78> room saying
<39> hi
<40> to somebody standing
<70> on
<43> your mark getting
<70> ready to
<40> record seeing them push
<70> the bored
<40> button
<43> and then performing in front
<70> of someone while
<39> the
<69> camera is rolling with that pressure
<70> on you to perform in that situation
<69> this is going be
<70> so
