what
you have to
do now is to not just
practice
lines but practice the situation what I mean by that I mean
practice this
scenario of
the
audition to put
yourself
in a mock
audition and practice
the pressure of
auditioning
so that when you do go into a live audition you
don't feel as as
you
feel more
confident this is very similar to professional sports where someone who has played
basketball their entire lives and
knows
how
shoot free throws and it's really good at
shooting
free they may not be able to perform well in a pressure
situation at
the end the game with
fans
screaming
at them are they going to be to
shoot
their
free throws as well as if they were shooting
by themselves in
the
gym probably not because it's a different situation
there under pressure right and sports teams will do
mock
pressure situations to help their athletes
prepare blasts
loud
music while people are shooting her free throws
or things like that right
so this is something we can
do is
actors as well
as the practice the situation
now
I think I
talked about
this
in another
video possibly
multiple
other
videos
but
I do
think this is such an
important topic
that it does deserve
its
own
video
so how can
we practice
these
pressure situations where one thing that you can do is to record yourself record yourself performing the
audition because when we practice just
sitting on the couch
or
practice well drive to the audition in our car there's pressure there because we're not being
recorded when you
set up a camera and
record yourself all send that changes something in you because you know
that you
have to perform because
something
is recording you this helps
this helps over the nerves of having that camera
in the
room because one
of the
things that makes us
nervous is when we walk that
audition room
we see that camera pointing
to
her face
that
makes us nervous but
if
you
get used
to
recording
yourself and get used
to that
camera on
you
all
the time
then
when you walk
into an
audition
and you have that camera on you it's going to
make you as
nervous
going
to feel more confident right now.
don't have to have
fancy
camera to do this most of us have a phone that can
record so record
yourself
with a phone set your phone
onto a tripod
adapters that
can just hold your phone if you don't have it if you don't have a tripod my recommendation is to buy one it's one
of best
purchases that
you
can make for your
acting career you'll
get so much
use
out of your tripod for self taping auditions
a
special but this is another
way to
use a tripod
is
to use it
to
hold
mock auditions to help you practice
for your
live auditions
now there's two big
benefits to
record
yourself
we've
already talked
about one of them which is you're getting used
to that
camera
recording you so
that when
walk
into an
audition
you're
totally used to having that camera there
the other
big benefit of recording
yourself
is that you
can
watch it back and evaluate and see how you did
some people will
say well can do that while practicing in front
of
mirror I discourage people from using a mirror practice their auditions
because you're never
focused 100% your performance when you practice
in
front
of mirror when you
press in front the
mirror you're
about
50% focused on your performance and
50% focused on evaluating it when
you
record yourself
you can devote a hundred percent
of
your
focused on your performance and then stop the recording and then walk around and watch it
back and then you can devote
100%
yourself
instead
of getting in front
of
a
mirror the other
thing that you'll notice is if you record and watch it back you
may see things
that you would not have picked up on
had
you not
recorded yourself using
myself as an example
when
first got started and
I was recording
myself practicing an
audition I noticed
that I was kind of swaying
back and forth and
subconscious thing that I was
doing and I knew
I
had to correct that had I not recorded myself and had I just gone to
my audition
I probably would have that unconsciously
at the audition and
I would not have
known
and
thought
I
did
a great job right for them a
casting
director will watch that back and sit and why was he
swing back and forth the
whole time so that's a huge benefit of recording yourself have an S thing that you can do to practice an audition
scenario
is
to
basically
role-play
that scenario
get
someone
to help
you with
this get
a
family member or friend or
a fellow actor that
you
know
to
help
you basically
roll play the audition have
them play
the role the
casting director and you're going to
basically play
play yourself as
you
walk into an
audition they're
going to be
operating
the
camera and recording you
saying
the lines as your reader
right and
this
again
will
help you get used to that situation
of
walking
into that audition
room saying
hi
to somebody standing
on
your mark getting
ready to
record seeing them push
the bored
button
and then performing in front
of someone while
the
camera is rolling with that pressure
on you to perform in that situation
this is going be
so
