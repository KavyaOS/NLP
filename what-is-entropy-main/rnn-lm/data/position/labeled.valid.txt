<69> audition I
<70> totally
<78> understand that
<69> at the making of this video
<70> we are still in a global
<43> pandemic
<70> and most if not all auditions are currently self tape and there no live auditions right now however I do expect that to slowly change and live auditions to slowly come back especially live
<43> call
<70> backs that being said we are getting
<69> live callbacks on Zoom
<66> meeting
<69> were
<42> talking
<52> to someone live
<43> but we're
<70> not in the room with them live
<67> right
<43> and
<70> what we're going to be talking about today still apply nice to the zoom
<67> call
<70> backs as well do what is it that every actor be doing before their live
<69> auditions it's not just to prepare for the audition
<42> that's
<69> obvious we
<70> have
<69> to prepare for the audition
<42> and
<69> prepare for the
<39> scene
<69> of research that
<67> role
<39> in
<69> research a character all of that
<42> stuff needs
<69> to happen this
<70> is something extra out if you're interested in learning how to
<69> prepare for the role
<70> all of that other stuff then I've actually created a 10-step audition preparation guide that I call my audition cheat sheet if you want
<43> to download at free

<70> process that I have used to help me book over 50 movies and television shows
<67> if
<70> want to download it go to that link right up there
<69> but today what we're talkin about is
<39> everything
<69> after
<39> you
<60> prepared for the role
<42> you rehearse
<60> your learned
<39> the lines
<69> you've learned the scene
<39> and
<40> all
<67> have
<70> to do well this last
<43> step that
<79> you should do
<70> before going in for live
<69> audition will
<70> help boost your confidence and reduce
<43> your
<40> nerves let's
<70> talk about a little bit about why we get nervous at an audition as after is the reason
<67> we get
<69> nervous it's not necessarily
<70> the lines we do worry about
<69> forgetting lines right
<70> but it isn't the lines that makes makes us nervous what
<52> makes us nervous is the
<70> situation that we have to perform our life that
<43> What Makes Us
<70> nervous is walking
<52> into that audition room and seeing that casting
<43> and see my
<39> camera recording
<70> us and then
<69> having to perform
<70> in
<69> front
<70> of them there's a lot of pressure there that's
<43> what
<69> makes us nervous
<70> because
<69> think about it when
<70> you've rehearsed your auditions
<43> in the past
<42> and I I've
<67> done
<40> this
<70> and you
<43> practice them and maybe you've done them 10
<70> times in a you
<43> did the
<70> lights
<43> 10
<70> times in row
<43> or
<40> 20
<43> times
<70> a row and got it
<43> right
<40> every single time
<39> and
<69> you did while you
<70> know in your living
<43> room
<52> at home and
<70> then you drive to
<43> audition
<79> and
<52> while you're the
<79> car you
<70> run through your lines
<79> again
<52> ten
<70> times
<43> 20
<79> times 30 times
<70> in a you did it perfectly
<43> every
<70> single time and
<43> then while you're sitting
<40> in the waiting room for the audition maybe you run
<43> through the lines
<70> in your head 10
<40> 20
<70> 30 times
<43> again
<70> you're doing
<43> perfectly
<40> but then go casting directors there
<67> that
<40> cameras on
<69> you they call Action
<66> you're
<70> under pressure all of a sudden
<43> you get nervous
<70> and now you start
<40> forgetting those lines
