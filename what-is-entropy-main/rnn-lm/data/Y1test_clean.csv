39	everything

60	for
60	the

42	rehearse
60	your
33	lines
33	you've

39	the
39	lines
69	you've
69	learned
69	the
69	scene
39	and
40	all
70	of
70	stuff
70	now
70	would
70	we

70	confidence
70	and
70	reduce
43	your
40	nerves
40	let's
70	talk
70	about
70	a
70	little
70	bit
70	about
70	why
70	we
70	get
70	nervous
70	at
70	an
70	audition
70	as
70	after
70	is
70	the
70	reason
67	we
67	get
69	nervous
69	it's
69	not
69	necessarily
70	the
70	lines
70	we
70	do
70	worry
70	about
69	forgetting
69	lines
69	right
70	but
70	it
70	isn't
70	the
70	lines
70	that
70	makes
70	makes
70	us
70	nervous
70	what
52	makes
52	us
52	nervous
52	is
52	the
70	situation
70	that
70	we
70	have
70	to
70	perform
70	our
70	life
70	that
43	What
43	Makes
43	Us
70	nervous
70	is
70	walking
52	into
52	that
52	audition
52	room
52	and
52	seeing
52	that
52	casting
43	and
43	see
43	my
39	camera
39	recording
70	us
70	and
70	then
69	having
69	to
69	perform
70	in
69	front
70	of
70	them
70	there's
70	a
70	lot
70	of
70	pressure
70	there
70	that's
43	what
69	makes
69	us
69	nervous
70	because
69	think
69	about
69	it
69	when
70	you've
70	rehearsed
70	your
70	auditions
43	in
43	the
43	past
42	and
42	I
42	I've
67	done
40	this
70	and
70	you
43	practice
43	them
43	and
43	maybe
43	you've
43	done
43	them
43	10
70	times
70	in
70	a
70	you
43	did
43	the
70	lights
43	10
70	times
70	in
70	row
43	or
40	20
43	times
70	a
70	row
70	and
70	got
70	it
43	right
40	every
40	single
40	time
39	and
69	you
69	did
69	while
69	you
70	know
70	in
70	your
70	living
43	room
52	at
52	home
52	and
70	then
70	you
70	drive
70	to
43	audition
79	and
52	while
52	you're
52	the
79	car
79	you
70	run
70	through
70	your
70	lines
79	again
52	ten
70	times
43	20
79	times
79	30
79	times
70	in
70	a
70	you
70	did
70	it
70	perfectly
43	every
70	single
70	time
70	and
43	then
43	while
43	you're
43	sitting
40	in
40	the
40	waiting
40	room
40	for
40	the
40	audition
40	maybe
40	you
40	run
43	through
43	the
43	lines
70	in
70	your
70	head
70	10
40	20
70	30
70	times
43	again
70	you're
70	doing
43	perfectly
40	but
40	then
40	go
49	into
49	the
49	audition
49	room
22	the
40	casting
40	directors
40	there
67	that
40	cameras
40	on
69	you
69	they
69	call
69	Action
66	you're
70	under
70	pressure
70	all
70	of
70	a
70	sudden
43	you
43	get
43	nervous
70	and
70	now
70	you
70	start
40	forgetting
40	those
40	lines
43	what
70	you
70	have
70	to
69	do
69	now
69	is
69	to
69	not
69	just
40	practice
70	lines
70	but
70	practice
70	the
70	situation
70	what
70	I
70	mean
70	by
70	that
70	I
70	mean
48	practice
48	this
78	scenario
78	of
69	the
70	audition
70	to
70	put
43	yourself
70	in
70	a
70	mock
69	audition
69	and
69	practice
70	the
70	pressure
70	of
52	auditioning
70	so
70	that
70	when
70	you
70	do
70	go
70	into
70	a
70	live
70	audition
70	you
69	don't
69	feel
69	as
69	as
70	you
69	feel
69	more
70	confident
70	this
70	is
70	very
70	similar
70	to
70	professional
70	sports
70	where
70	someone
70	who
70	has
70	played
43	basketball
43	their
43	entire
43	lives
43	and
70	knows
43	how
70	shoot
70	free
70	throws
70	and
70	it's
70	really
70	good
70	at
67	shooting
70	free
70	they
70	may
70	not
70	be
70	able
70	to
70	perform
70	well
70	in
70	a
70	pressure
40	situation
40	at
48	the
48	end
48	the
48	game
48	with
70	30,000
70	fans
40	screaming
70	at
70	them
70	are
70	they
70	going
70	to
70	be
70	to
67	shoot
66	their
69	free
69	throws
69	as
69	well
69	as
69	if
69	they
69	were
69	shooting
70	by
70	themselves
70	in
40	the
43	gym
43	probably
43	not
43	because
43	it's
43	a
43	different
43	situation
70	there
70	under
70	pressure
70	right
70	and
70	sports
70	teams
70	will
70	do
43	mock
70	pressure
70	situations
70	to
70	help
70	their
70	athletes
48	prepare
18	for
21	those
48	blasts
43	loud
70	music
70	while
70	people
70	are
70	shooting
70	her
70	free
70	throws
69	or
69	things
69	like
69	that
69	right
70	so
70	this
70	is
70	something
70	we
70	can
43	do
43	is
79	actors
79	as
79	well
70	as
70	the
70	practice
70	the
70	situation
43	now
70	I
70	think
70	I
43	talked
43	about
70	this
43	in
43	another
70	video
70	possibly
40	multiple
43	other
70	videos
43	but
70	I
70	do
69	think
69	this
69	is
69	such
69	an
78	important
78	topic
69	that
69	it
69	does
69	deserve
42	its
70	own
43	video
52	so
52	how
52	can
70	we
70	practice
43	these
70	pressure
70	situations
70	where
70	one
70	thing
70	that
70	you
70	can
70	do
70	is
70	to
70	record
70	yourself
70	record
70	yourself
70	performing
70	the
69	audition
69	because
69	when
69	we
69	practice
69	just
70	sitting
70	on
70	the
70	couch
52	or
70	practice
70	well
70	drive
70	to
70	the
70	audition
70	in
70	our
70	car
70	there's
70	pressure
70	there
70	because
70	we're
70	not
70	being
43	recorded
24	but
43	when
43	you
39	set
39	up
39	a
39	camera
39	and
70	record
70	yourself
70	all
70	send
70	that
70	changes
70	something
70	in
70	you
70	because
70	you
70	know
43	that
43	you
70	have
70	to
70	perform
70	because
40	something
70	is
70	recording
70	you
70	this
70	helps
43	this
43	helps
49	get
43	over
43	the
43	nerves
43	of
43	having
43	that
43	camera
70	in
70	the
43	room
43	because
43	one
70	of
70	the
43	things
43	that
43	makes
43	us
70	nervous
70	is
70	when
70	we
70	walk
70	that
43	audition
43	room
40	we
40	see
40	that
40	camera
40	pointing
43	to
70	her
70	face
66	that
39	makes
39	us
39	nervous
39	but
66	if
67	you
43	get
43	used
40	to
39	recording
67	yourself
67	and
67	get
67	used
43	to
43	that
70	camera
70	on
43	you
40	all
67	the
67	time
40	then
43	when
43	you
43	walk
40	into
40	an
43	audition
70	and
70	you
70	have
70	that
70	camera
70	on
70	you
70	it's
70	going
70	to
69	make
69	you
69	as
42	nervous
43	going
70	to
70	feel
70	more
70	confident
70	right
70	now.
69	don't
69	have
69	to
69	have
70	fancy
43	camera
43	to
43	do
43	this
43	most
43	of
43	us
43	have
43	a
43	phone
43	that
43	can
70	record
70	so
70	record
40	yourself
52	with
52	a
52	phone
52	set
52	your
52	phone
40	onto
40	a
40	tripod
25	they
25	have
25	tripods
25	with
25	phone
43	adapters
43	that
70	can
70	just
70	hold
70	your
70	phone
70	if
70	you
70	don't
70	have
70	it
70	if
70	you
70	don't
70	have
70	a
70	tripod
70	my
70	recommendation
70	is
70	to
70	buy
70	one
70	it's
70	one
40	of
40	best
67	purchases
67	that
70	you
67	can
67	make
67	for
67	your
69	acting
69	career
69	you'll
70	get
70	so
70	much
43	use
70	out
70	of
70	your
70	tripod
70	for
70	self
70	taping
70	auditions
43	a
70	special
70	but
70	this
70	is
70	another
67	way
67	to
70	use
70	a
70	tripod
69	is
70	to
70	use
70	it
67	to
66	hold
70	mock
70	auditions
70	to
70	help
70	you
70	practice
67	for
67	your
70	live
70	auditions
69	now
69	there's
69	two
69	big
42	benefits
42	to
43	record
70	yourself
43	we've
40	already
40	talked
70	about
70	one
70	of
70	them
70	which
70	is
70	you're
70	getting
70	used
43	to
43	that
52	camera
70	recording
70	you
70	so
40	that
40	when
51	walk
78	into
78	an
42	audition
69	you're
70	totally
70	used
70	to
70	having
70	that
70	camera
70	there
69	the
69	other
70	big
70	benefit
70	of
70	recording
43	yourself
70	is
70	that
70	you
43	can
70	watch
70	it
70	back
70	and
70	evaluate
70	and
70	see
70	how
70	you
70	did
69	some
69	people
69	will
70	say
70	well
70	can
70	do
70	that
70	while
70	practicing
70	in
70	front
43	of
70	mirror
70	I
70	discourage
70	people
70	from
70	using
70	a
70	mirror
70	practice
70	their
70	auditions
40	because
40	you're
40	never
70	focused
70	100%
70	your
70	performance
70	when
70	you
70	practice
43	in
40	front
70	of
70	mirror
70	when
70	you
66	press
66	in
66	front
66	the
67	mirror
67	you're
69	about
39	50%
39	focused
39	on
39	your
39	performance
39	and
40	50%
40	focused
40	on
40	evaluating
40	it
40	when
39	you
40	record
40	yourself
70	you
70	can
70	devote
70	a
70	hundred
70	percent
43	of
70	your
43	focused
43	on
43	your
43	performance
43	and
43	then
43	stop
43	the
43	recording
43	and
43	then
43	walk
43	around
43	and
43	watch
43	it
70	back
70	and
70	then
70	you
70	can
70	devote
40	100%
43	of
70	your
70	attention
70	on
70	evaluating
70	it
70	right
70	so
70	this
70	is
70	why
70	I
70	recommend
70	recording
43	yourself
70	instead
43	of
43	getting
43	in
43	front
70	of
67	a
40	mirror
40	the
40	other
70	thing
70	that
70	you'll
70	notice
70	is
70	if
70	you
70	record
70	and
70	watch
70	it
70	back
70	you
43	may
43	see
43	things
70	that
70	you
70	would
70	not
70	have
70	picked
70	up
70	on
67	had
40	you
40	not
43	recorded
43	yourself
43	using
70	myself
70	as
70	an
70	example
67	when
40	first
40	got
40	started
40	and
70	I
70	was
70	recording
69	myself
69	practicing
69	an
70	audition
70	I
70	noticed
69	that
69	I
69	was
69	kind
69	of
69	swaying
70	back
70	and
70	forth
70	and
69	this
69	was
69	an
70	unconscious
70	thing
70	of
43	subconscious
43	thing
43	that
43	I
43	was
70	doing
70	and
70	I
70	knew
43	I
70	had
70	to
70	correct
70	that
70	had
70	I
70	not
70	recorded
70	myself
70	and
70	had
70	I
70	just
70	gone
70	to
43	my
43	audition
40	I
40	probably
40	would
40	have
40	that
40	unconsciously
70	at
70	the
70	audition
70	and
52	I
52	would
52	not
52	have
43	known
48	I
48	would
48	just
48	walked
75	out
75	the
78	room
69	and
43	thought
52	I
43	did
70	a
70	great
70	job
70	right
70	for
70	them
70	a
43	casting
70	director
70	will
70	watch
70	that
70	back
70	and
70	sit
70	and
70	why
70	was
70	he
43	swing
43	back
43	and
43	forth
43	the
70	whole
70	time
70	so
70	that's
70	a
70	huge
70	benefit
70	of
70	recording
70	yourself
70	have
70	an
70	S
70	thing
70	that
70	you
70	can
70	do
70	to
70	practice
70	an
70	audition
69	scenario
48	is
51	to
78	basically
70	role-play
43	that
43	scenario
70	get
43	someone
70	to
70	help
43	you
43	with
70	this
70	get
43	a
70	family
70	member
70	or
70	friend
70	or
40	a
40	fellow
40	actor
40	that
43	you
40	know
43	to
67	help
70	you
70	basically
43	roll
43	play
43	the
43	audition
43	have
40	them
40	play
39	the
39	role

69	casting
69	director
69	and
69	you're
69	going
69	to
43	basically
43	play
70	play
70	yourself
70	as
43	you
52	walk
52	into
52	an
79	audition
79	they're
52	going

40	the
40	lines
40	as
40	your
40	reader
70	right
70	and
42	this
69	again
39	will
70	help
70	you
70	get
70	used
70	to
70	that
70	situation
43	of
52	walking
51	into
51	that
51	audition
78	room
78	saying
39	hi
40	to

69	that
69	pressure
70	on
70	you
70	to
70	perform
70	in
70	that
70	situation
69	this
69	is
