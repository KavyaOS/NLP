43 43 43 43 	 one thing that I
40 	 recommend
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 every after do before every single live audition that will help boost
67 67 67 67 	 their confidence and reduce
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 their nerves let's talk about it what's my pillow mattress welcome to acting career center to help you learn the skills you need to break into the film and television industry my name is heard you thank you so much for spending some here with me today if this is your first time here make that hit that subscribe button to get more videos on acting auditioning and career advice every single

69 69 	 audition I
70 	 totally
78 78 	 understand that
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 at the making of this video

43 	 call
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 backs that being said we are getting
69 69 69 69 	 live callbacks on Zoom

69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 auditions it's not just to prepare for the audition
42 	 that's
69 69 	 obvious we
70 	 have
69 69 69 69 69 	 to prepare for the audition
42 	 and
69 69 69 	 prepare for the
39 	 scene
69 69 69 	 of research that
67 	 role
39 	 in
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 research a character all of that
42 42 	 stuff needs
69 69 69 	 to happen this

69 69 69 69 	 prepare for the role

43 43 43 43 	 to download at free
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 cheat sheet you can get it by going that link right

70 	 audition
69 	 preparation
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 process that I have used to help me book over 50 movies and television shows
67 	 if
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 want to download it go to that link right up there
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 but today what we're talkin about is
39 	 everything
69 	 after
39 	 you
60 60 60 60 	 prepared for the role
42 42 	 you rehearse
60 60 	 your learned
39 39 	 the lines
69 69 69 69 	 you've learned the scene
39 	 and
40 	 all
70 70 70 70 70 	 of stuff now would we
67 	 have
70 70 70 70 70 	 to do well this last
43 43 	 step that
79 79 79 	 you should do
70 70 70 70 70 	 before going in for live
69 69 	 audition will
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 help boost your confidence and reduce
43 	 your
40 40 	 nerves let's
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 talk about a little bit about why we get nervous at an audition as after is the reason
67 67 	 we get
69 69 69 69 	 nervous it's not necessarily
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 the lines we do worry about
69 69 69 	 forgetting lines right
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 but it isn't the lines that makes makes us nervous what
52 52 52 52 52 	 makes us nervous is the
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 situation that we have to perform our life that
43 43 43 	 What Makes Us
70 70 70 	 nervous is walking
52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 	 into that audition room and seeing that casting
43 43 43 	 and see my
39 39 	 camera recording
70 70 70 	 us and then
69 69 69 	 having to perform
70 	 in
69 	 front
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 of them there's a lot of pressure there that's
43 	 what
69 69 69 	 makes us nervous
70 	 because
69 69 69 69 	 think about it when
70 70 70 70 	 you've rehearsed your auditions
43 43 43 	 in the past
42 42 42 	 and I I've
67 	 done
40 	 this
70 70 	 and you
43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 	 practice them and maybe you've done them 10
70 70 70 70 	 times in a you
43 43 	 did the
70 	 lights
43 	 10
70 70 70 	 times in row
43 	 or
40 	 20
43 	 times
70 70 70 70 70 	 a row and got it
43 	 right
40 40 40 	 every single time
39 	 and
69 69 69 69 	 you did while you
70 70 70 70 	 know in your living
43 	 room
52 52 52 	 at home and
70 70 70 70 	 then you drive to
43 	 audition
79 	 and
52 52 52 	 while you're the
79 79 	 car you
70 70 70 70 	 run through your lines
79 	 again
52 	 ten
70 	 times
43 	 20
79 79 79 	 times 30 times
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 in a you did it perfectly
43 	 every
70 70 70 	 single time and
43 43 43 43 	 then while you're sitting
40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 	 in the waiting room for the audition maybe you run
43 43 43 	 through the lines
70 70 70 70 	 in your head 10
40 	 20
70 70 	 30 times
43 	 again
70 70 	 you're doing
43 	 perfectly
40 40 40 40 40 40 	 but then go casting directors there
67 	 that
40 40 	 cameras on
69 69 69 69 	 you they call Action
66 	 you're
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 under pressure all of a sudden
43 43 43 	 you get nervous
70 70 70 70 	 and now you start
40 40 40 	 forgetting those lines
43 	 what
70 70 70 	 you have to
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 do now is to not just
40 	 practice
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 lines but practice the situation what I mean by that I mean
48 48 	 practice this
78 78 	 scenario of
69 	 the
70 70 70 	 audition to put
43 	 yourself
70 70 70 	 in a mock
69 69 69 	 audition and practice
70 70 70 	 the pressure of
52 	 auditioning
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 so that when you do go into a live audition you
69 69 69 69 	 don't feel as as
70 	 you
69 69 	 feel more
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 confident this is very similar to professional sports where someone who has played
43 43 43 43 43 	 basketball their entire lives and
70 	 knows
43 	 how
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 shoot free throws and it's really good at
67 	 shooting
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 free they may not be able to perform well in a pressure
40 40 	 situation at
48 48 48 48 48 	 the end the game with
70 	 fans
40 	 screaming
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 at them are they going to be to
67 	 shoot
66 	 their
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 free throws as well as if they were shooting
70 70 70 	 by themselves in
40 	 the
43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 	 gym probably not because it's a different situation
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 there under pressure right and sports teams will do
43 	 mock
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 pressure situations to help their athletes
48 48 	 prepare blasts
43 	 loud
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 music while people are shooting her free throws
69 69 69 69 69 	 or things like that right
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 so this is something we can
43 43 	 do is
79 79 79 	 actors as well
70 70 70 70 70 	 as the practice the situation
43 	 now
70 70 70 	 I think I
43 43 	 talked about
70 	 this
43 43 	 in another
70 70 	 video possibly
40 	 multiple
43 	 other
70 	 videos
43 	 but
70 70 	 I do
69 69 69 69 69 	 think this is such an
78 78 	 important topic
69 69 69 69 	 that it does deserve
42 	 its
70 	 own
43 	 video
52 52 52 	 so how can
70 70 	 we practice
43 	 these
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 pressure situations where one thing that you can do is to record yourself record yourself performing the
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 audition because when we practice just
70 70 70 70 	 sitting on the couch
52 	 or
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 practice well drive to the audition in our car there's pressure there because we're not being
43 43 43 	 recorded when you
39 39 39 39 39 	 set up a camera and
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 record yourself all send that changes something in you because you know
43 43 	 that you
70 70 70 70 	 have to perform because
40 	 something
70 70 70 70 70 	 is recording you this helps
43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 	 this helps over the nerves of having that camera
70 70 	 in the
43 43 43 	 room because one
70 70 	 of the
43 43 43 43 	 things that makes us
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 nervous is when we walk that
43 43 	 audition room
40 40 40 40 40 	 we see that camera pointing
43 	 to
70 70 	 her face
66 	 that
39 39 39 39 	 makes us nervous but
66 	 if
67 	 you
43 43 	 get used
40 	 to
39 	 recording
67 67 67 67 	 yourself and get used
43 43 	 to that
70 70 	 camera on
43 	 you
40 	 all
67 67 	 the time
40 	 then
43 43 43 	 when you walk
40 40 	 into an
43 	 audition
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 and you have that camera on you it's going to
69 69 69 	 make you as
42 	 nervous
43 	 going
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to feel more confident right now.
69 69 69 69 	 don't have to have
70 	 fancy
43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 	 camera to do this most of us have a phone that can
70 70 70 	 record so record
40 	 yourself
52 52 52 52 52 52 	 with a phone set your phone
40 40 40 	 onto a tripod
43 43 	 adapters that
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 can just hold your phone if you don't have it if you don't have a tripod my recommendation is to buy one it's one
40 40 	 of best
67 67 	 purchases that
70 	 you
67 67 67 67 	 can make for your
69 69 69 	 acting career you'll
70 70 70 	 get so much
43 	 use
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 out of your tripod for self taping auditions
43 	 a
70 70 70 70 70 	 special but this is another
67 67 	 way to
70 70 70 	 use a tripod
69 	 is
70 70 70 	 to use it
67 	 to
66 	 hold
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 mock auditions to help you practice
67 67 	 for your
70 70 	 live auditions
69 69 69 69 	 now there's two big
42 42 	 benefits to
43 	 record
70 	 yourself
43 	 we've
40 40 	 already talked
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 about one of them which is you're getting used
43 43 	 to that
52 	 camera
70 70 70 	 recording you so
40 40 	 that when
51 	 walk
78 78 	 into an
42 	 audition
69 	 you're
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 totally used to having that camera there
69 69 	 the other
70 70 70 70 	 big benefit of recording
43 	 yourself
70 70 70 	 is that you
43 	 can
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 watch it back and evaluate and see how you did
69 69 69 	 some people will
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 say well can do that while practicing in front
43 	 of
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 mirror I discourage people from using a mirror practice their auditions
40 40 40 	 because you're never
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 focused 100% your performance when you practice
43 	 in
40 	 front
70 70 70 70 	 of mirror when you
66 66 66 66 	 press in front the
67 67 	 mirror you're
69 	 about
39 39 39 39 39 39 	 50% focused on your performance and
40 40 40 40 40 40 	 50% focused on evaluating it when
39 	 you
40 40 	 record yourself
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you can devote a hundred percent
43 	 of
70 	 your
43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 	 focused on your performance and then stop the recording and then walk around and watch it
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 back and then you can devote
40 	 100%
43 	 of
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 your attention on evaluating it right so this is why I recommend recording
43 	 yourself
70 	 instead
43 43 43 43 	 of getting in front
70 	 of
67 	 a
40 40 40 	 mirror the other
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 thing that you'll notice is if you record and watch it back you
43 43 43 	 may see things
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 that you would not have picked up on
67 	 had
40 40 	 you not
43 43 43 	 recorded yourself using
70 70 70 70 	 myself as an example
67 	 when
40 40 40 40 	 first got started and
70 70 70 	 I was recording
69 69 69 	 myself practicing an
70 70 70 	 audition I noticed
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 that I was kind of swaying
70 70 70 70 	 back and forth and
69 69 69 	 this was an
70 70 70 	 unconscious thing of
43 43 43 43 43 	 subconscious thing that I was
70 70 70 70 	 doing and I knew
43 	 I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 had to correct that had I not recorded myself and had I just gone to
43 43 	 my audition
40 40 40 40 40 40 	 I probably would have that unconsciously
70 70 70 70 	 at the audition and
52 52 52 52 	 I would not have
43 	 known
48 48 48 48 	 I would just walked
78 	 room
69 	 and
43 	 thought
52 	 I
43 	 did
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 a great job right for them a
43 	 casting
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 director will watch that back and sit and why was he
43 43 43 43 43 	 swing back and forth the
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 whole time so that's a huge benefit of recording yourself have an S thing that you can do to practice an audition
69 	 scenario
48 	 is
51 	 to
78 	 basically
70 	 role-play
43 43 	 that scenario
70 	 get
43 	 someone
70 70 	 to help
43 43 	 you with
70 70 	 this get
43 	 a
70 70 70 70 70 	 family member or friend or
40 40 40 40 	 a fellow actor that
43 	 you
40 	 know
43 	 to
67 	 help
70 70 	 you basically
43 43 43 43 43 	 roll play the audition have
40 40 	 them play
39 39 39 	 the role the
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 casting director and you're going to
43 43 	 basically play
70 70 70 	 play yourself as
43 	 you
52 52 52 	 walk into an
79 79 	 audition they're
52 52 52 	 going to be
43 	 operating
52 	 the
43 43 43 43 	 camera and recording you
70 	 saying
40 40 40 40 40 	 the lines as your reader
70 70 	 right and
42 	 this
69 	 again
39 	 will
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 help you get used to that situation
43 	 of
52 	 walking
51 51 51 	 into that audition
78 78 	 room saying
39 	 hi

69 69 69 69 	 story is pre unique
70 	 and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 Ice didn't start the way lot of people did because I'm not one of those people that watch the movie or a play when
42 42 42 	 I was 5
51 51 51 	 years and was
70 70 70 70 	 mesmerised and wanted to
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 be an actor ever since I actually didn't do any acting when I was kid didn't any acting high school or in
66 	 college
70 	 I
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 actually went to college for computer science and engineering that was my major and that was my
42 42 42 42 	 degree in after I
69 	 graduated
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 I was working in the corporate world as a
69 	 software
42 42 	 developer I
51 51 	 actually worked
70 70 70 	 as software developer
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 for many years so I had a whole
70 70 70 70 70 	 nother life before I started
69 69 69 69 69 	 my acting career the way
70 70 70 	 I got into
43 	 acting
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 was actually because I was working in
42 42 42 	 the corporate world
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I had job in this was in Cleveland Ohio so I grew up in Cleveland I went to Michigan for
70 	 college
42 42 42 42 42 	 and then I came back
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 to Cleveland for before my first
129 129 129 129 129 129 129 129 129 129 129 129 	 and he was actually photo of me my cubicle trying cool as
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 a software developer this was back I think I'll round maybe two thousand eight or something like which
70 70 70 	 is roughly when
69 69 	 I started
70 	 taking
69 69 	 acting classes
70 70 70 70 	 the way I got
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 into it was that me and my
42 	 best
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 from high school who is also working
70 70 	 a Corporate
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 Drive In Cleveland we would often
70 	 meet
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 up after work just looking for something fun to do after work with sometimes we can go to a
70 70 	 bar restaurant
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 for happy hour I remember we had even
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 attended a few Toastmasters meetings if you know what Toastmasters is
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I also signed up for jiu jitsu classes for a. Of time back then and
42 42 	 at one
69 69 	 point we
70 	 having
67 	 to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 walk by this acting studio in Cleveland Ohio and this was in April of

42 42 42 42 	 hood School of acting
69 69 	 houde school
70 	 of
69 69 	 acting in
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 Cleveland Ohio for the link to them down in the description below I've actually interviewed
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 Jessica Hood Morris here on this YouTube channel about the
70 70 	 Meisner technique
69 69 69 69 69 	 which is an acting technique
42 42 42 42 	 that they teach at
69 69 	 that school
70 70 	 if you
69 	 want
70 	 to
69 69 	 watch that
70 70 	 interview all
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 put that down in the description below as well but anyways so me and my friend we happen find this acting school and we went to a free class to audit and looks fun
70 70 70 	 so we signed
42 42 42 	 for classes and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I remember when I signed up I had zero expectations in terms of
42 	 making
69 	 a
42 	 career
69 69 69 	 change in fact
42 42 42 42 	 there not a single
51 51 51 51 	 brain cell in my
78 	 head
69 69 69 	 was thinking that
70 70 70 	 I would pursue
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 acting as a career I signed up for those classes
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 strictly because it look like it would be something fun to do and when I signed up I was thinking well it was month-to-month type of class and I thinking that I could take
69 69 69 69 	 classes for a month
66 	 see
69 69 69 69 69 	 how I liked it if
70 70 70 	 I didn't like
43 	 I
70 70 70 	 would just stop
69 	 taking
51 51 	 classes the
78 78 	 next month
51 	 if
42 	 it
69 	 then
70 70 70 	 I would just
69 69 69 69 	 sign up for another
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 month and then another month and and just see how it goes well when I signed up in 2008 I actually
69 69 	 kept taking
70 70 70 	 classes there for
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 the next eight years so that's how much I enjoyed those classes in for that first year or it was again strictly doing it for fun
70 	 I
69 	 had
51 	 no
69 69 69 	 expectation of trying
70 	 get
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 an agent or make money or any of those things but the cool thing was is that that acting
70 70 70 70 	 class whether I knew
69 69 	 it or
70 70 	 at the
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 time I was gaining so much experience and so much knowledge while I was in there because it was that acting class that I made connections
40 40 40 	 was able to
67 67 	 get me
70 	 my
42 	 first
69 69 69 69 69 	 role in short film and
40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 	 my first rolls in student filmed it was through that acting class that I got my first role in play
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 professional headshot and it was through
69 	 that
70 70 	 acting class
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 that I ended up getting my first agent the way I
60 	 got
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 that agent was because one of the
70 70 70 70 70 	 students in the class was
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 represented by an agent and she introduced me to her agent and that's how I got my first representation
42 42 	 that's also
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 what I tell people is the best way get an
70 70 	 agent is
69 69 	 through a
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 referral because that carries so more weight
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 than if you were to submit to an agent directly on your
70 	 own
69 69 69 69 	 that acting class gave
42 42 	 me so
69 69 69 69 69 	 many opportunities before I even
70 70 70 70 	 imagined getting the agent
43 43 43 43 	 or making any money
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 and part of reason why I never had the
69 69 	 idea of
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 potentially pursuing it a career was because I was
69 69 	 very naive
39 39 39 39 	 to industry before I
69 69 	 started taking
70 70 	 the classes
69 69 	 I thought
42 	 and
39 	 I
40 	 don't
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I'm only one that thought this way I
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 think plenty of other people do
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 it specially people that don't really know about the acting industry at all but I just
60 	 assumed
69 	 that
39 39 39 39 	 that was made on
40 	 TV
70 70 70 70 70 	 was made in Hollywood I
67 67 67 67 67 67 67 	 assumed everything that we saw on our
66 66 66 66 	 TV screen any small
69 69 69 69 	 commercial or anything like
42 42 	 that I
69 69 69 69 69 	 assumed was made in Hollywood
70 70 70 	 I never even
69 69 	 considered that
51 	 local
69 	 commercials
39 39 	 for a
69 69 69 	 local company like
39 39 	 local car
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 dealership might be made locally I never consider that even though makes perfect sense that that would happen
70 70 70 	 but it took
43 	 me
70 70 	 being in
43 43 	 class to
70 70 70 	 learn these things
42 42 	 the way
69 69 69 	 I Learned was
42 42 	 that I
69 69 	 saw other
42 	 people
69 69 69 	 in class other
42 42 42 42 42 42 	 students in a class who had
43 	 agents
42 	 who
69 69 	 were auditioning
42 42 42 42 	 for these types things
69 	 and
70 70 	 would see
69 69 69 69 69 	 them on TV and that
60 	 was
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 amazing to me so that's how I learned about those things that local
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 commercials would be made locally and they would hire
69 	 local
42 	 actors
69 69 69 	 so when first
72 72 	 agent things
48 	 I
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 started on dishes in 4 to begin with because Cleveland Ohio is a very small market in terms of film television production
70 	 there
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 are zero TV show is being made
70 70 70 70 	 there at least when
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I was there and there are maybe there might be one or two movies that come into town per year so when
70 70 70 	 I was there
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 99% of the auditions that actors
70 70 70 	 would get through
69 69 	 their agents
70 70 70 	 would for local
69 69 	 commercials or
70 70 70 	 for industrial videos
69 	 and
70 	 what
69 69 69 69 69 	 industrial videos are our videos
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 that are used companies for internal
69 69 	 use a
70 70 	 great example
69 	 of
39 	 an
69 69 69 69 	 industrial video is a
42 	 training
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 video so if you've ever had
39 	 a
40 40 	 job at
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 company and you watch the training video
43 43 43 43 43 	 on how do your job
69 69 69 69 69 	 those actors in those training
70 70 70 70 	 videos or acting in
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 industrial videos and I've done a ton of those when
70 70 	 I was
69 69 69 69 	 in Cleveland so that's
70 70 	 how I
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 got started that was my first agent and those were first types of things I started auditioning for when
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 I was when I got my
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 first agent in 2009 so this was about an a year after I started taking acting I was still working my
60 60 60 	 full-time job and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 in fact I didn't quit my full-time job for a long time from 2009 through 2014 so those
70 70 	 four and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 a half or so and 2013 beginning of 2014 for those four a half years I had an agent but I'm still working my full-time job as a software developer
42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 	 and what I would do is if I got an
69 69 69 69 	 audition I would go
70 70 	 on my
69 	 lunch
70 70 70 70 70 	 break to do that audition
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and then I will come back to work and then if I
42 	 ever
51 51 51 51 51 	 booked then I would actually
42 42 42 42 	 just take a day
69 69 69 	 off of work
70 70 70 70 	 and then do whatever
69 	 acting
42 42 	 job that
69 69 	 I booked
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 a weather at the commercial or
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 video or something like that and then
66 	 I
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 would come back to work the next day and I
70 	 did
69 69 	 that for
70 70 	 many years
69 69 69 69 69 	 I was working my full-time
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 job and then every once awhile I would have an audition and then everyone small I would book something
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and it wasn't until 2014 that I decided that
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 maybe I want to try to do a little bit more
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 with acting so here's what happened at the end of 2013
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 I was just finishing up a 12-month contract
69 69 69 69 	 for my software job
70 	 and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 come January of 2014 I had decision to make I could either take a
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 new contract for my software job or I can take a break and I elected to take a break at the time but my thought process was that I'm going to take 6 months off from my software job and try focus a little bit more on acting to see where that takes me and I
69 69 69 	 thought that I
42 	 can
69 69 69 69 	 do this because I
70 70 	 had saved
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 up some money and I felt I was in a financial and
42 42 	 where I
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 could take that risk and devote more time to my acting and
42 42 	 the reason
69 69 69 69 69 	 why I say is because
42 42 	 when I
51 51 51 	 was working full-time
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 there were certain auditions that my agent was sent me that I would have to turn down because I was working
42 	 on
51 51 51 51 51 51 	 a high-priority project work that I
42 	 couldn't
69 	 leave
42 42 	 for I
51 51 51 	 couldn't take our
42 42 42 42 42 42 42 	 lunch break to go to that audition
51 51 51 	 and I definitely
42 42 42 	 couldn't take a
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 day off a full day off from
70 	 work
69 69 69 69 	 to go work an
70 	 acting
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 job when had this high-priority project at work
70 70 	 so there
66 66 	 were certain
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 times when I had to turn down auditions
70 70 70 70 70 	 and turn down bookings and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 this gave me an opportunity in the beginning of
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 2014 to push my software job aside for six months to
69 69 69 69 	 see what I could
70 70 70 70 	 do if I focused
69 	 100%
52 	 on
79 	 my
52 	 acting
69 69 	 career my
42 	 thought
69 	 was
70 70 70 70 70 	 that I was going to
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 take it 6 months at a and if things started going downhill
70 	 and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I can always fall back on my software career and
70 70 70 70 	 go back to that
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 job well that was 20 14 now its 2020 and in the past six years
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 I have not taken another software job since then so I've been really lucky and really blessed to have been to been able
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 to fully focus on my acting career this entire time sure I've had side hustles and side gigs
70 70 	 to bring
69 69 	 in extra
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 income but besides that I've been
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 able to support myself primarily with
70 70 70 70 	 my acting career now
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 that's how I was able to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 start my career in Cleveland Ohio but as many of you
69 	 I
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 currently live in Atlanta Georgia so
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 how did I end up here
61 	 well
69 69 69 	 back in 2015
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 so about a year after I took my
69 69 69 	 break from software
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 and started focusing a hundred percent on acting in 2015 I met two people from Atlanta to actors from Atlanta
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 are their names were Alan O'Reilly and Jenna kanell and
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 meeting them really open open my eyes to Atlanta
69 69 	 as a
42 	 potential
69 69 69 69 	 opportunity destination because remember
39 	 I
60 	 before
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 that I was very naive to the industry and I
70 70 70 	 didn't know that
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 you know local things were made in Cleveland Ohio well
70 	 even
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 after taking acting from 2008 to 2015 I was still very naive to the acting industry outside of my local market so I understood how things
39 39 39 39 39 	 worked in Cleveland and in
69 69 69 	 kind the surrounding
70 70 	 areas but
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 still don't really understand how the whole industry work outside of our Market
60 	 I
69 69 69 69 	 still thought that movies
42 	 and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 TV shows were all made in Hollywood right
70 	 and
69 	 it
70 70 	 took meeting
69 69 69 	 Alan and Jenna
70 70 70 	 to tell me
69 69 69 69 	 that know there are
70 70 	 other cities
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 out there that have a lot of film and television
70 70 70 70 	 production and since they
69 69 69 	 were from Atlanta
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 they really opened my eyes to what was going on
69 69 	 in Atlanta
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 so when they told me about that I started researching it and that was when really
69 	 started
70 	 considering
69 69 69 69 69 	 moving down to Atlanta and
43 43 43 43 	 it didn't take long
70 	 after
69 	 that
70 70 	 only a
69 69 	 few months
70 70 70 70 70 	 later in 2016 was when
69 	 I
70 70 70 	 decided to make
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 the and come down here to Atlanta the reason I made the move was because when was in Cleveland Ohio yeah I
70 70 	 wanted to
69 	 audition
39 	 for
69 69 69 	 movies and television
39 	 shows
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I wanted to work on movies
42 	 and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 those opportunities just didn't exist are the video that I just made last week was about what's the city to pursue an acting career and where you live does matter because certain
70 70 70 70 70 	 cities have more film and
69 69 	 television production
60 	 than
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 others and Atlanta happens to be one those cities and Cleveland doesn't happen to one of those cities so when was in Cleveland I
60 60 60 	 wanted to audition
69 	 for
70 70 	 movies and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 shows but there was just not that opportunity I might get one audition for
60 60 	 a per
69 69 69 69 69 	 year if that sometimes zero
70 70 70 	 auditions for movies
69 69 	 and death
70 70 70 70 70 	 no auditions for TV shows
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 the entire time that I was there
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 once I move to Atlanta a
42 	 much
43 43 	 bigger production
70 	 Market
69 	 a
70 70 70 	 lot of movies
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and shows are made here I started getting auditions for movies
66 66 	 and shows
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 every week often multiple times a
51 51 	 week two
69 	 instead
42 	 of
69 69 	 one audition
70 70 	 for a
69 	 per
70 70 	 year it
69 	 was
70 70 70 	 an audition every
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 week for a movie so it
70 70 70 70 	 was very but it
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 was such a drastic change from what I was used to this move
42 	 to
69 	 Atlanta
70 70 	 was that
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 next step that my career needed if you look at my IMDb profile
60 60 60 60 	 you'll see that all
69 69 69 69 	 of the movies and
43 	 television
42 42 42 	 shows that I've
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 worked on they've all been from 2016 onwards everything before that most of it was
70 70 70 70 	 just short films and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 projects that worked on with my friends
42 	 so
70 70 70 	 this move to
69 69 69 69 69 	 Atlanta was a huge change
66 	 from
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 my career and one thing that want to mention is that this
70 	 entire
69 69 69 69 	 time since 2008 I
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 never stopped taking acting classes from
42 	 that
69 	 first
42 42 	 day forward
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I always continue to take classes
42 42 42 	 I didn't stop
51 51 	 my agent
39 	 I
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 didn't stop when I booked my first job
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 I didn't stop when I got my first movie
69 69 69 	 or my first
70 70 70 70 	 television show I continue
69 69 69 69 69 	 to take acting all the
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 way through it but that's because
69 	 I
70 70 70 	 really believe in
69 69 	 I really
70 70 70 70 70 	 believe that actors need to
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 continue their training throughout their careers because there's always something
70 70 70 70 70 	 new learn there's always something
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 to improve and I feel like
51 51 51 	 that is a
42 	 huge
69 69 69 69 	 reason for the successes
42 	 that
51 51 51 	 I still take
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 acting classes is that I know
70 70 70 	 that I still
43 	 have
52 52 52 52 	 so room to grow
70 70 	 in my
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 career I'm nowhere near what I think my potential can be for example I just had my first lead
43 	 role
52 52 	 in a
42 	 feature
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 film that came out this month
69 69 69 	 so I have
70 70 70 	 so much more
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 to look forward to in my career and that's why I continue to train when move to Atlanta the
70 	 first
69 69 69 69 69 	 thing that I did was
70 70 	 I signed
69 69 69 69 69 	 up for more acting classes
66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 	 in Atlanta so I really do believe in that when
69 69 69 	 I start to
39 	 look
69 69 	 back on
70 70 	 my career
67 	 as
66 66 66 	 a software developer
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 when I was sitting in a cubicle and staring at computer screen it feels like an entire
70 	 lifetime
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 ago now I would not trade this for
42 42 	 the world
51 51 51 51 51 	 I've had so many great
70 70 	 experiences up
43 	 until
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 now and I look forward to what the future has
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 to offer and I know so many of you that are watching this that follow my YouTube channel
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 are trying build your own acting
39 	 careers
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and that is the whole goal of this
70 70 70 70 	 acting career center YouTube
43 	 channel
51 51 	 is that
78 78 78 78 78 78 	 help you with that is it
70 70 70 	 helped you get
69 69 69 69 	 to where I am
78 78 	 and hopefully
70 70 70 70 	 well beyond where I
43 	 am
61 	 in
70 	 my
69 	 career
70 	 so
69 69 69 69 69 	 that is it for this
42 42 42 	 video if you
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 liked it please give it a thumbs
70 70 70 	 up and if
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 you have questions for me remember to leave them down
39 	 in
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 the comments until next time keep
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 if you want to be cast in movie or television
70 70 70 	 show is really
69 69 	 important to
70 	 understand
43 	 exactly
70 70 70 70 70 	 how the casting process works
69 69 69 	 because the audition
70 	 is
69 69 69 69 69 	 not the only step in
70 70 70 	 the process as
69 69 69 	 actors we really
70 70 70 70 70 	 only know about the audition
69 	 because
39 	 it's
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 the only step that we are
70 70 70 70 	 directly involved in right
67 	 but
70 70 70 70 70 	 there are steps before and
69 69 	 after audition
70 70 70 	 that are just
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 as significant and if you don't understand how you could be sabotaging your own chances of getting so

69 69 69 	 out of the

70 70 	 the casting
40 40 	 process works
48 48 48 	 give you a
78 78 78 	 kind a high-level
70 70 	 overview of
42 	 the
69 69 69 69 	 casting process there are
70 	 specific
69 	 details
70 70 70 	 that different from
69 	 case
70 70 70 	 case from Project
42 	 to
69 	 but
48 48 48 48 48 48 	 I will give you a view
69 69 	 of how
70 70 	 in general
69 69 	 the casting
70 70 70 70 	 process works for movie
69 	 13
42 	 steps
69 69 69 69 	 that it takes to
70 70 70 70 	 cast a role in
43 43 43 43 43 	 movie or show and how
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 your audition kind fits into those steps let's
39 	 say
40 	 a
70 70 70 	 Disney movie movie
40 	 is
70 	 done
69 69 69 	 being written with
70 70 70 	 the writers of
69 	 finish
42 	 writing
69 	 the
70 70 70 70 70 	 script they now need to
69 	 cast
42 42 	 the movie
69 69 69 	 right so the
52 	 producers
79 	 now
78 	 need
42 	 hire
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 a casting director this is the
70 70 70 70 	 producers of the movie
69 69 69 	 to help the
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 casting director than take that script breakdown for those
69 69 	 roll a
39 	 breakdown
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 is just a short description of each roll inside the script
42 	 and
48 	 then
69 69 69 69 69 	 Step 2 is that the
40 	 casting
70 70 70 70 	 director will then send
43 	 those
70 70 70 70 	 breakdowns out to agent
42 42 	 sometimes those
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 breakdowns will be sent publicly posted
70 70 70 	 publicly as well
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 on sites like Afters access so that
60 	 individual
69 	 actors
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 and access most of the time for big budget movies and
43 43 	 television shows
70 	 they
51 	 go
61 61 	 directly to
70 70 70 70 	 ages and will not
69 	 be
70 70 70 70 	 posted publicly I would
69 69 69 69 	 say 95% of time
42 42 42 	 or more write
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 down to only go to agents and will not be posted publicly so that taxes can not access
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 them directly that's why it is so important that an after get an agent at some point in their career has
40 40 	 the breakdown
39 39 	 they will
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 then take them to their roster of all the actors
42 	 they
51 	 represent
40 	 in
70 	 C250
69 69 69 	 do it for
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 simplicity's sake in our example let's only focus on
69 69 69 69 69 	 one particular role because movie
48 48 48 	 script can have
70 70 70 	 50 or more
42 42 42 	 that needed cast
78 	 from
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 the lead all the way down
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 to all the supporting role let's just focus on one
42 	 person
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 that works in the coffee and the
70 70 70 70 	 description is 16 to
69 	 25
40 	 male
70 70 	 or female
69 69 69 	 so that's the
70 	 character
42 	 breakdown
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 breakdown I done look my roster of all the actors I represent repeat
66 	 that
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 break down okay and once I find that group of people all of those actors
42 42 	 that did
69 	 the
70 	 breakdown
69 	 by
70 70 	 then send
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 the headshot resume and demo reel of
39 	 all
40 40 40 40 	 of those actors in
69 	 a
42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 	 casting director in a casting director here are all of the actors okay
60 	 so
61 61 	 we're not
40 40 40 40 40 	 involving the actors yet this
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 is communication between the casting director
42 42 42 42 	 any agent so far
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 is step three agent now sending all of the
40 40 40 	 actors they represent
43 	 back
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to the casting director for a particular rule casting director has received all of those
78 	 headshots
39 39 39 	 resumes in demo
48 	 reel
78 78 78 	 they now look
69 	 at
42 42 42 42 42 	 all of these actors and
69 	 decide
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 which ones they would like to
69 69 	 see audition
70 70 	 now in
69 	 an
78 78 	 ideal world
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 every single after would get a chance to audition but
70 70 	 unfortunately in
69 69 	 the real
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 world there just isn't that much time available that's the
69 	 problem
70 	 have
78 78 78 78 	 enough time to audition
69 69 69 69 	 every single after that
70 70 70 70 70 	 wants to wash dishes because
43 	 think
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 about it we're only talking about one agent
69 69 	 here typically
48 48 48 	 a casting will
51 	 reach
48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 	 out to dozens of Agents so in dozens of
69 69 	 Agents all
42 	 send
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 all of their actors that fit that particular coffee shop worker roll the casting director could potentially get the mission of hundreds or even thousands of actor headshots there's no way that the casting director can audition hundreds or thousands of people for that one role
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 because remember there are fifty other roles that need be
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 cast for this movie rights over this particular rule they might be able to see 20 or 30
42 	 answers
51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 	 that means it's for each agency that they might only be
42 42 42 42 42 42 42 	 able to audition after or two actors
69 69 	 for each
70 70 70 70 70 	 agency this is why it
43 	 is
70 70 70 70 70 	 so important to have a
39 	 great
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 head shop because in this step the process how are you going to stand out casting director
48 	 the
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 is looking at a CD of hundreds
51 	 of
42 	 headshot
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and they have to decide 20 or
72 72 72 72 	 30 out of all
69 	 of
72 72 72 	 those people that
69 	 they
72 72 72 72 	 want to see en
69 69 69 69 69 	 douchen so you have to
72 72 72 72 	 have a head shot
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 that really catches their eye really stands out for
72 72 72 	 decide I want
69 	 to
70 70 	 see this
43 43 	 person so
39 39 	 that is
70 70 70 	 Step 4 step
42 	 four
69 69 	 is the
42 	 casting
69 69 	 director selecting
70 70 	 which actor
42 42 42 42 42 	 they would like to see
69 69 	 audition and
42 42 42 	 then telling that
52 	 to
70 70 70 	 agent saying hey
69 	 thank
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you for sending me all of these
42 	 actors
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 that fit this role here are the two actors I would like
43 43 43 43 43 	 to see audition please moving
70 70 	 on to
69 69 	 step five
70 	 step
79 	 five
70 70 70 70 	 is now the agent
43 43 	 now passing
70 70 70 	 that information to
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 the actor now finally the actor
70 	 comes
43 43 43 	 into play the
42 42 	 agent will
60 60 60 	 then tell the
69 	 answer
42 	 hey
60 	 you
61 	 got
60 60 	 an audition
42 	 and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 here are the sides step 6 is the actor preparing for the audition

69 69 69 69 69 69 	 common these days is doing a

42 42 	 at home
70 70 70 70 	 and then send to
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 the casting director Stephanie is the casting director reviewing every single audition from each of the actor
42 42 42 42 42 	 if they were in person
51 	 auditions
78 	 they
51 	 would
78 	 have
51 51 	 all been
69 	 recorded
42 42 42 	 in the room
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 for the casting director will wash all of those auditions back again or if they were self wash
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 all of those tapes at this
42 	 point
69 	 could
70 	 not
69 69 	 be call
70 	 Bast
79 79 79 	 depending on the
70 	 project
43 	 and
69 69 69 	 depending on the
70 	 roll
69 69 69 	 a call back
70 	 is
78 	 when
42 	 a
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 casting directors and bring back some of the actors that they really liked for
43 	 that
52 	 particular
43 	 role
69 	 to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 give them a second round of auditions if an actor gets a call back that means are really interested in them for rule they
69 	 they've
70 70 70 70 70 	 been brought back not everybody
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 gets brought back call back they usually only bring back the people that they are
42 	 really
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 interested in now some auditions don't have all that sometimes they will just booked the actor off of the initial audition some will have one round callbacks some others will
78 78 	 have even
51 	 more
42 	 than
69 69 69 69 	 one producer sessions and
70 70 70 70 	 network test and all
43 	 kinds
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 stuff here is that there might be call back there might not be but just understand what they are in this process after the
43 	 callbacks
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 the casting director will then make their recommendations for each role of the
70 70 70 	 project the producers
79 	 so
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 that is Step 10 the casting director recommending their top or top
43 	 five
70 	 actors
43 43 	 for each
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 role to producers for a final casting decisions eleven the final casting decision now needs to be made it's important to understand
43 43 	 that the
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 casting director does not make the final casting decision they
43 	 may
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 have influenced but they are not
42 	 the
69 69 69 	 final maker for
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 a television show The Final Decision makers are the producers the
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 showrunner and the network Run movie It's
79 79 	 usually the
70 	 producers
69 69 69 	 and the director
70 70 70 70 	 the important thing is
43 	 that
70 	 it
69 69 	 is not
42 42 42 	 the casting director
51 51 	 the casting
42 42 42 42 42 42 42 	 director does have an important role in
51 	 the
42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 	 beginning of the process because they select who they want to see audition so in a way they do
69 69 69 	 decide has a
42 	 chance
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 in the part but when it comes to the very end they don't make that final decision so that
79 	 was
70 70 70 70 	 step 11th step 12
69 	 is
78 	 once
69 	 a
78 78 78 	 final decision is
42 42 42 42 42 	 made the casting director then
78 78 	 extend an
69 	 offer
78 	 to
69 	 the
42 	 agent
69 69 69 69 69 	 of that after and then
70 70 70 	 Step 13 is
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 the final step of the agent
42 	 then
69 	 passes
70 70 70 	 along that offer
43 	 to
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 the Acura and said hey after you have
42 42 42 42 42 	 just booked the role of
69 69 	 coffee shop

78 78 78 78 	 about the opportunities for
69 69 	 actors in
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 Atlanta but before we get started on that topic I got a few quick housekeeping notes to get to because I have not made a video in a long time so if you have been a subscriber to this channel for a while maybe
69 	 since
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 I started it back in 2014
69 69 	 first of
70 	 all
69 	 thank
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you second of all I really apologize for
69 	 not
70 70 70 70 	 making a video in
40 40 40 	 a while but
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 one of the main reasons for my Hiatus is
69 	 Atlanta
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 my acting career has gotten really really busy after moved here to
48 48 	 Atlanta hence
69 69 69 69 69 	 the reason for this so
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 one you may have noticed is that the name of the channel has changed what used to small market
69 69 	 after is
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 now acting career center now part of the reason for the change is
69 69 69 	 actually Atlanta because
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 I no live in small Market I moved from Cleveland Ohio to Atlanta Georgia back in 2016 and
69 69 	 Atlanta just
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 happens to be one of the biggest film and television production cities in world right
69 	 now
66 	 which
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 we will talk about later so small Market actor and small Market actor.com or
69 69 69 69 69 	 no more and in their
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 place we now have acting career center and acting career
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and I think this name this new name the channel is
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 Ashley a better reflection of what I am originally intended for it be anyway because what I really wanted to do with
69 69 69 69 	 this channel in beginning
70 70 	 was to
69 69 	 help educate
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 people to help to help people who were newer actors were new to the industry who
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 wanted to make this career but didn't know
70 70 70 	 how to and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I've been working after since 2009 and in
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 that time I've gained so much knowledge and so much experience that I
69 69 	 hope to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to share with you too hopefully you know lead you down the right
69 69 69 	 path limit your
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 mistakes so you can continue down this road of becoming a working professional after because like I know it can hard at times it can be and it can be frustrating at times if you if you're an actor who's been plugging along and feel like you've made no traction look I get
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 it so I'm doing this to hopefully inspire you to show
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you that if someone like me can do it if this for software developer a guy who didn't study acting High School didn't study acting in college I didn't take my first acting
69 	 class
78 	 until
69 69 	 I was
70 70 70 	 26 old guys
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 if someone like me can do this
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 then you can absolutely do this too as long as you're willing to work hard you're willing to study and learn not just the craft
43 	 acting
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 but also the business of the industry and you're willing to be a professional in every sense of the word if you're willing do those three things then I've no doubt that you have got a shot and making this your career
69 69 69 	 and that's exactly
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 why I made this channel the acting career center to help you do just that if that sounds like
43 	 something
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you want to learn more about then take subscribe to this channel if you haven't already and leave me comment down below if you have any burning questions leave me question down below that
69 69 69 	 I could possibly
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 answer for you in a future video okay
69 	 all
78 78 	 right enough
39 	 keeping
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 stuff let's talk about Atlanta so back in 2015 when I was still living in Ohio I really had no idea that the film and television industry even existed down here in Atlanta and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 that it had already been here for years and was growing year after year and
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 the thing that really propelled Atlanta this is just like a tiny little history lesson the thing that really propelled Atlanta to becoming what it is today was back in 2008 tax credit was passed the state that gave production companies a huge financial incentive to bring their projects to Georgia and
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 after that happened there was it
39 	 didn't
69 69 	 happen overnight
78 	 but
42 42 	 year after
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 year the film industry grew and grew and grew to
70 70 70 	 the where now
69 69 69 	 in 2020 I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 want get this number right film and TV has grown become a nine point five billion dollar industry
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 in state of Georgia in 2016 this is a crazy fact the year than I moved to Atlanta in 2016 there were more major feature films
42 42 42 	 made in Georgia
70 70 	 than California
69 69 	 what Mina
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 with me when first heard that California that's where Hollywood is and you're telling me more movies were made in Georgia than California is true in the movies made
79 79 79 79 79 79 79 	 Georgia aren't some obscure films that you've
70 	 never
43 	 heard
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 of day are some of the biggest Blockbusters in theaters year after year including the highest grossing movie of all time Avengers endgame shot in Georgia down in Pinewood Studios just south of Atlanta so

61 61 61 	 in past decade
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 The Walking Dead stranger things the resident The Vampire Diaries The Originals Ozark Watchman Atlanta Dynasty Black Lightning insatiable Cobra Kai MacGyver Lodge 49 The Haunting Hill House Doom Patrol Halt and Catch Fire the gifted star

43 	 being
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 shot in his massive 330-acre Studio Lot right the heart of Atlanta yeah so
78 78 78 	 all of that
69 	 has
78 78 78 78 78 	 happened all of that and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 has in Georgia in the past decade
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 basically since 2008 crazy crazy so okay now back to our original question for you should you as an after move to Atlanta for your acting
43 43 	 career well
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 ultimately that's a very personal question right is not the
43 	 question
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 that I can just say yes or no to because it's going to different for but what I can do is provide you with as much information as possible to hopefully lead
69 69 	 you to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 make a better-informed decision that's right for your exact situation
69 69 	 okay factors
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 that I think you take into account when you're deciding whether or not you move to Atlanta
61 61 61 61 61 61 	 for acting first of all if
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you're still worried about Atlanta being too small of a market compared
69 	 to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 Los Angeles or York if you're still worried that you may not get enough opportunities in market
43 43 	 like even
70 70 70 	 though I just
61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 	 gave you that giant list of movies and television
70 	 shows
43 43 43 	 that were being
42 42 	 made here
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 if that's your main concern let me put that to rest
70 70 	 right now
69 	 I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 want to share with you my story might number of auditions that I've been getting for film and TV since I've been here at the time go all way back to 2011 so I'm going to you number of film and TV auditions that I have received year after year since 2011 which was back when I still lived in Ohio and then I'll bring it all the way to 2019 last year so
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 for the past three living in Atlanta all right you're ready in 2011
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 the number of film TV auditions I
43 	 got
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 one one total the whole year 2012 0 20130 2014 320 15 7 2016 all right 2016 is when I move to Atlanta got my first agent in Atlanta number of film and TV on Dish's I got in 2016 76 2017 105 2018 92 2019 110 wow I mean that's all I can that it's kind of mind-boggling that I went from getting just a
69 69 69 69 	 couple sometimes zero film
70 	 and
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 TV auditions in whole year to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 getting over a hundred a year I mean in 2019 on 110 film and TV auditions in a year that's one every three days that's
61 61 61 61 61 61 	 crazy to me so when I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 say that the amount of opportunity in Atlanta is huge
43 	 is
52 	 almost
79 79 79 79 79 79 	 mind-blowing I'm not exaggerating at all
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 so if you were an actor that's thinking about moving to Atlanta and your biggest hang-up is wondering if you're going to get enough opportunities I want to just just forget that
79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 	 and also if there's anyone telling you that you have to move to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career they're just wrong the wrong
78 78 78 78 	 they don't know what
42 42 42 	 they're talkin about
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 look I'm not saying that Atlanta is the only place you can go I'm not saying that you can't go to a Los Angeles but just want you to know that there other options available and Atlanta just happens be one of the best options okay so then the
70 70 70 	 next question that
48 	 a
51 51 	 lot of
78 78 	 people have
69 69 69 	 when I say
78 78 	 all these
69 	 crazy
78 78 78 	 numbers and I'm
40 40 40 	 getting all these
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 great opportunities people will ask what does that mean Atlanta is better than Olay well that's an even tougher question answer because better is going to different for everybody situation again
43 	 what's
70 	 better
43 	 for
52 52 52 	 me may you
40 40 	 may not
67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 	 be better for the next person so again you're going to have to figure
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 out exactly what you're looking for will your specific situation is and then whether Atlanta or LA or New York or any other Market has the best things offer you I will say this though I do think if you are an actor who is just starting out who is new to the industry and who who is just trying to get their first few credits I think Atlanta is better option than La I actually think Atlanta might be the best option in country for an actor like that may be the best option in the world
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and I'll tell why there are
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 in my opinion fewer barriers to entry in Atlanta what I mean by that I mean that you will have more access to the things that newer actors are always trying to get which is get an agent which is start getting auditions and just start getting out there and trying to book rolls it is not uncommon for an actor in Atlanta who is brand new to the to be able to get an agent in their first year in first few months of being here and start auditioning immediately for big TV shows and big
40 	 movies
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 so I do think a newer after coming to Atlanta versus and you
43 	 were
52 52 	 after in
79 79 79 79 	 the same situation going
43 	 to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 La I think that actor in Atlanta is going to have an easier time getting an agent is to have a little bit of an easier time getting auditions getting their first few auditions and is going to have a little bit of an easier time probably booking there for few jobs so the no there's a few reasons one is that there are there there are just fewer actors in Atlanta so a little bit less competition now that's not to say there is there aren't that many actors in Atlanta there are a ton of trees here and there are more moving here day by day but compared to La Atlanta's nowhere near saturated as a market like Los Angeles another factor is that like I mentioned before it's not uncommon for an agent and a pretty good agent in Atlanta to sign an actor who doesn't really have that much experience who to sign them right out the gate and start giving them auditions start giving them opportunities whereas in Los Angeles now. Lauder I've never lived in Los Angeles but I've had friends that live there and I've heard their stories and from what I hear that situation that I described for an actor in Atlanta that doesn't happen in La what's more common in La is that agents want to see legitimate film and television credits mostly television credit on your resume before they're willing sign you which puts new Rafters and kind of a catch-22 of well how do I get credits before I have an agent and then how do I get an agent before I have credits it kind of doesn't
43 43 	 make sense
67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 	 so for those reasons it does it is a
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 little bit easier for a newer actor to kind break into the industry here in
69 69 69 	 Atlanta compared to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 the some the bigger markets like in LA or York another factor that would make Atlanta a more
69 69 	 desirable place
78 78 78 	 and this goes
69 69 69 	 beyond you were
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 actors is that the cost of living in Atlanta is a lot
69 	 better
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 than the cost of living in Los you probably already heard the stories of how how expensive it is to live in
43 	 a
70 	 place
61 61 	 like Los
70 70 70 	 Angeles Los so
61 61 61 61 61 61 	 I just pulled up the numbers
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 of the median rent in La for a one-bedroom apartment is the median rent in La for one-bedroom apartment is now the median rent in Atlanta for a one-bedroom apartment is so that's like a $800 difference there that's not to say different neighborhoods are going
67 67 	 to have
69 69 	 are going
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to be higher or lower in each City but this is just on average are going to be paying lot less for the same thing in Atlanta for your living situation then in Los
43 	 Angeles
52 	 also
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 if you're looking to buy a place the medium the median home price in Los Angeles is and the median home price in Atlanta is so that is just
69 	 more
70 70 70 70 70 	 affordable to live here all
69 69 69 	 these myself is
78 	 example
51 51 	 I can
48 48 48 48 48 48 48 	 afford to live in this place I've
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 been fortunate enough to buy my place here in Atlanta
48 48 	 and I
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 would not be able to afford a place like this in Los Angeles it would cost many
70 70 70 	 times more than
69 69 	 I paid
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 for here and I've actually heard many stories about actors in Los Angeles who blew through all of their Savings in less than a year and had to move back home because they just weren't ready for how much it actually cost to live there and is the people that are living there and haven't move back home it feels like they're spending all of their time working just trying to make enough money to pay rent and live in survive and they don't have money for acting classes and they don't have money for headshots and don't have money to actually pursue their career because it's so expensive
48 	 to
78 	 live
69 69 69 	 in that City
70 70 	 again I
69 	 haven't
79 79 	 lived there
42 	 so
43 	 I
42 42 42 	 can't do a
51 	 apples-to-apples
78 78 78 	 comparison but I
48 48 	 will say
70 70 	 I feel
69 69 69 	 very financially stable
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 where I am right now in Atlanta okay really her I said that it was easier for an actor in Atlanta to kind break into the industry compared to that same actor in Los Angeles and I want to make a distinction I want to make it very clear that I'm saying it's easier not easy it's certainly not easy to break into this industry no matter what
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 Market you're in so I don't want to make this
70 70 70 	 sound like a
69 	 l
72 	 a
70 	 bashing
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 session I'm certainly not saying that
70 70 70 70 70 	 there's anything wrong with LA
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 or there's anything bad with LA
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 there's just these differences and there are certain reasons why someone may want to go to La instead
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 of Atlanta to let's talk about a few of those first
39 39 39 	 of all and
48 48 	 this is
39 39 39 39 39 	 kind a woo Hollywood thing
40 	 but
43 	 Hollywood
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 does have this kind of Mystique about it Hollywood does have that I mean there's this though the Romantic idea of going to Hollywood to pursue your dreams is an after right it it's that if that dream that every kid has Growing Up So if you're in love with that
52 52 52 	 idea that that
43 43 43 	 story that that
70 70 70 	 story that lalala
43 	 presented
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to in that movie if you're in love with that then there's probably there's probably nothing that I can say anyone
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 else can say to tell you to go to a different Market because Atlanta certainly is La it's it's different
78 78 78 	 it's got its
69 69 69 69 	 own great things about
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 it but it is in that City so if you're in love with that idea of pursuing your career in Hollywood and bio meets go do that because no other city is going be able to give that to you another thing the lifestyle the lifestyle in La
69 69 69 69 	 is just that's another
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 animal in itself and if that's something that you desire if you love that weather if you want the same 65 to 70 degree weather year round if you want get out there on the beach and surf if you want to
43 43 	 if you
52 52 	 want that
79 79 79 	 potential opportunity to
52 	 run
79 	 into
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 a Warner Brothers executive at coffee shop on a Saturday
48 	 morning
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 La you got to go to
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 La for that right now here some real legitimate things for for actors
42 	 career-wise
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 sitcoms if your if your thing is sitcoms and you think you're an after that will that will really thrive in a sitcom and you want
42 	 audition
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 for sitcoms you got to go to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 La there are no sitcoms being shot in Atlanta right now none at least in 2020 there's not being shot here right now same thing with soap operas no soap operas in Atlanta if your thing is you want
79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 	 be on a soap opera and you want to pursue that
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 above everything else and got to to La there's no question about it there's there there were soap operas in New York but I don't think there are any of their now either so you really just got to go La for that another thing I want say about a late is that from you
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 or actors I'm not saying and were after should
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 never go to La I think Atlanta is best option for a actor trying break into the industry right now but there's no reason to to think that you can't come to a Atlanta and start your career off here and if you start gaining some traction and start booking and start building credit on your resume and really start making getting a good demo reel together maybe
69 	 at
66 66 	 that point
69 69 69 	 maybe that point
66 66 66 66 	 is when you go
69 69 69 	 to LA because
66 	 now
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 you'll be more desirable to two agents into casting in place like Los Angeles
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 rather than the the hordes people that
78 78 78 78 	 move there every who
69 	 have
78 78 	 zero experience
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 so the last thing I'll is that
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I've been in Atlanta since 2016 I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 have no plans on moving to La anytime
79 	 soon
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 I have no plans on moving to New York or
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 anywhere else for that matter I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 I really love it here I love my situation here I love my agent I love the auditions that I'm
69 69 	 getting I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 am booking I'm getting to work on sets of some big huge movies and television shows every
69 	 year
48 48 	 and I
78 78 	 can afford
69 69 69 	 to own a
51 51 51 51 	 home I can also
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 afford to rent a office space for my photography
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 there's one more thing that about Atlanta I'd have always tell people I the community here just from the top down from the actors to the teachers to the agents to the casting directors to just everybody in the community here in Atlanta in this industry is so supportive of one another and wants to see each other succeed I just it warms my heart thinking about the actors here in Atlanta and how much they are cheering each other on it's great and again I've never lived in Los Angeles or New York or another big acting Market but just from accounts from friends of mine I don't hear them saying the same
43 43 	 thing in
52 52 	 those cities

69 69 69 69 69 	 Atlanta all right that's about
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 all I to say I know that it might have sounded a little biased because I live in Atlanta but I'm certainly not trying to convince any you want to move here but if you're in position where you're thinking about moving to another Market all I want to do is give

43 	 anything
69 69 69 69 	 beyond it being a
70 70 70 	 hobby than you
43 	 do
42 42 	 have to
70 70 70 	 take some necessary
69 	 steps
72 	 the
69 69 	 first step
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to starting an acting career is to take
43 	 acting
52 52 52 52 52 	 and there are plenty of
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 acting classes that you can take here's list
69 69 69 69 69 	 of some classes I would
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 recommend you can write these down if you want technique classes
69 	 scene
52 52 	 study classes
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 improv classes on camera pause his voice and movement accents and dialects
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 weapons and combat script analysis and
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 audition classes now that I would recommend any actors start with this is the very first step
42 	 that
70 70 	 every single
69 69 69 	 actor must take
43 	 and
52 	 it
51 51 51 	 cannot be skipped
69 	 you
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 cannot skip taking acting you can't
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 just get an agent to start auditioning for movies and television shows it doesn't
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 work that way and it's not because you're not talented it's because you got to
69 	 give
70 70 	 casting directors
69 69 69 	 and agents and
70 70 70 70 	 actors and of reason
40 	 trust
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 show them that you're serious about this as your career
78 78 78 	 I'll use an
69 	 example
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 here let's say you were playing a sport and you broke your and you needed surgery and I came and told you hey I'll
43 43 	 do the
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 surgery for you I never went to medical school I never learned to do a surgery but I'll do
69 69 69 	 for you I'm
79 79 79 	 confident that I'll
70 	 do
79 	 it
67 67 	 are you
70 	 to
67 	 trust
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 me to perform surgery on your arm with the dumbest thing I've heard or would you trust someone who went medical school that's the point here you got to give him a reason to put their trust in you to cast you in their project that is only one benefit of taking acting another huge
69 69 69 	 benefit of acting
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 classes is that it will build your network in this career the more people that you know the more people that know you the more chances that you will have to succeed and to move forward in his career because you're building a community when you go to acting classes
69 	 I
52 52 52 52 	 can't tell you that

69 69 69 69 69 	 gotten so many opportunities for
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 my acting teacher has a bunch of my IMDb credits for movies came from projects that acting teachers were other students recommended that I audition for in that I eventually this is the real power of of a network and a network that you can build by going to acting class this is why I've continued to go to acting class for 12 years I've been taking acting like every single year at my entire career because I know how how much it benefits my career and it's not just the stuff that I learned in class improving my
69 	 technique
78 	 and
51 	 proving
78 78 78 78 78 	 my acting ability which is
69 	 extremely
70 70 70 	 important but it's
69 69 	 also the
48 48 	 network but
78 78 78 	 I'm building the
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 community classes The Next Step every actor needs to take especially
70 70 70 70 	 if they want start
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 auditioning for anything is to get a professional
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 headshot your headshot is your most important marketing tool as an actor it's the extremely important to make a first impression is another just
69 69 69 	 you're trying to
70 70 70 70 70 	 pursue acting professionally then you
69 69 69 	 have to get
70 	 a
69 	 professional
70 70 70 	 headshot if you
43 	 want
52 	 agents
70 70 70 	 and casting directors
43 	 to
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 take you seriously then you have to show them that you are taking your career seriously you
51 	 want
78 78 78 	 them to have
70 70 70 70 	 confidence in you and
69 69 69 69 	 you can't give them
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 a picture that was taken on your eye so how do find a good headshot photographer well ask the people in your acting class that's another great benefit
43 	 of
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 your acting classes that you have people to
51 	 rely
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 on to give you advice I can tell you who
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 are some headshot photographers where I live in
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 Atlanta but if you don't live where I am you're not
42 42 42 42 42 42 	 going to come all way here
69 69 	 to take
70 70 70 	 head shot so
43 	 you
42 42 	 were going
69 	 to
70 	 want
69 	 ask
78 78 78 78 78 	 the people that in your
69 	 city
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 who you can go to to get a great
69 	 headshot
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to a great place to ask is
69 	 in
70 	 your
79 79 79 79 79 	 acting class so those were
52 52 	 the first
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 two steps to starting an acting career before you
69 69 	 go out
78 	 on
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 any auditions you got go to acting
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 class you got to get a professional headshots now let's talk about three more steps that every single actor needs to take the first one is to start finding auditions on your own and start auditioning for project you got to be able to do this yourself before
51 51 	 you get
78 78 78 78 78 	 an agent to do it
69 69 69 69 	 for you and nesse
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 after that is learning how to self tape so most auditions these days will request you to record your own audition at home instead of going live and in so you got learn how to record it at home and that's called a self tape you got to be able to do that as
78 	 get
129 129 	 professionally have
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 is most auditions for big movies and television shows you will never be able find on your own as an
40 40 40 40 40 40 	 two agents and for the agents
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to pass on to their actors last year I was able to find
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I think five or six auditions for big movies and television shows by myself on sites
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 Actors Access and you how many my
69 69 	 agent found
70 70 	 me over
69 69 	 a hundred
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 so I was able to find five or six but my agent found a hundred more for me so that's why it's so important at some point in career that you will need to get an eighth so those are three more steps that you will
69 69 69 69 	 need to take I'm
78 78 	 not going
69 69 69 69 	 to go in-depth into
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 each of those because I actually have
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 individual videos on each of those three topics I have a video on how to find auditions on your own and submit to them I have a video on
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 creating a great self tape at
43 	 home
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 and I a video on four ways to get a talent agent so I'll put links all three of those separate videos down in the description below I will also put a link down there for another video that's called the cost of an acting
79 79 79 79 79 79 	 career and in that video I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 break down how much each of these things that we've just talked about will typically
69 	 cost
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you so how much you should expect to pay for acting classes for headshots how much you should expect
69 69 69 69 	 it to pay an
70 70 	 so will
69 69 69 	 in the description
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 the last thing I to share with you today are few words
79 79 	 of inspiration
70 70 	 and encouragement
69 	 and
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 those words come from those words come from
39 39 	 the answers
70 	 to
69 69 69 	 my two questions
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 earlier on in this video why do you want be an actor and what
52 52 52 52 	 your goals are for

69 69 69 69 69 	 going to a lot of
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 got it in you talk to any famous actor right now

69 69 	 a never-give-up
70 70 	 and one
69 69 	 way that

40 	 and
70 70 70 70 70 	 feeling down about this career
69 69 69 	 is always think

39 39 	 hello everyone
66 	 today
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 sharing with you how to create your very own online course now I recently shared on Instagram that I was going to be challenging myself to create mini course in just three days and I did accomplish that at least the rough draft I accomplished within 3 days but I want you know is that while this is to following that process that took to create this in three days you by no means have to create your horse in three days the reason that I said that really aggressive goals for myself is because in the past I
67 67 67 67 67 67 	 have several courses out already and
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 those all took me months to create
69 	 and
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 they really didn't need to it was really because was doubting myself
66 	 and
69 69 69 69 	 with overthinking things and
70 70 70 	 so that's why
69 69 69 69 	 I said aggressive cool
70 70 	 but you
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 definitely should take all the time that
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you need specially if this is your very first course because you do obviously want it
69 	 to
70 70 70 70 	 be a quality product
67 	 so
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 let's hop in the first thing you're going to to do is come up with a topic for your course and this is
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 like the easiest through the hardest
70 70 70 70 	 thing at the same
67 	 time
70 	 my
40 	 best
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 advice to you is to start with the topic that you could talk about all day long for free something that you know if I were to say
67 	 what
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 is the thing that you're most passionate about her that your most knowledgeable about her that your most skilled hat or we do whatever it is that you would instantly know what that is and
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 especially for me since I was
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 on this time crunch that's what I went to I went to kind
66 66 	 the easiest
70 70 	 thing the
69 69 69 	 thing that I'm
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 the most trained in the thing I'm the most
69 69 	 knowledgeable about
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 when I really think about it
66 	 which
69 	 is
66 	 video
69 	 I
70 	 went
69 69 	 to school
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 for film and video I have been editing videos in either classroom setting or professionally for over
66 66 66 66 	 decade now which is
69 69 69 	 crazy to about
67 	 a
69 69 	 third my
67 67 67 	 life essentially it's
66 	 another
69 69 69 69 69 	 thing that you want think
70 70 	 about when
67 	 coming
66 66 66 66 	 up with your course
69 69 	 topic is
67 67 67 67 	 you know what is
66 	 the
69 69 69 	 competitive landscape like
78 78 78 	 I could do
69 69 69 	 a quart is
70 70 70 70 70 	 on a million different things
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 but a lot of those things are very
70 	 saturated
69 	 right
70 70 70 	 a lot of
69 69 69 69 	 courses there's like million
70 	 different
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 courses about insert topic here I feel like there are forces out there but there is not
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 lot towards business owners in the way I just described
69 	 at
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 least that I've run across so
69 	 I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 thought that it was a little bit less saturated but
69 69 69 69 69 	 at the same time just
70 70 	 from the
69 69 69 69 	 conversations have with my
70 70 70 	 clients and from
69 	 you
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 guys it is something that people want
69 69 69 69 	 to know about it's
70 70 	 also the
69 69 69 69 	 number one question I
70 70 	 get asked
69 69 69 	 you know when
70 	 people
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 hop on coaching calls with me or you no see at conference or whatever
70 70 70 	 the there was
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 tell me about your YouTube how did you your YouTube
43 	 that
79 79 79 79 79 79 	 kind thing and I think it's
40 	 important
69 	 if
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you have any kind of an existing audience so Instagram
69 	 followers
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 YouTube followers email list Facebook group
69 	 whoever
70 70 70 70 	 wherever your community is
66 	 survey
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 them a little bit so I asked in my
70 	 Facebook
69 	 group
70 	 and
69 	 he
70 70 70 70 70 	 also asked on my Instagram
66 66 	 stories what
69 69 69 	 people would prefer
66 66 	 for this
69 	 many
70 70 	 course gave
69 	 them
66 	 two
69 69 69 69 	 options and also said
67 	 hey
66 	 if
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 you have you any other suggestions
66 	 let
67 67 67 67 	 me know then open
69 69 	 razor on
66 66 66 66 66 66 	 day one after I had the
69 	 topic
66 66 	 idea in
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 mind is I came up with a title and
66 	 this
69 	 is
70 	 working
66 	 title
69 69 	 again I
70 70 	 think a
69 	 of
70 	 people
69 	 get
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 tripped up on this and I'm the honestly like not the best at title so maybe do little bit of external research
69 69 69 69 	 when it comes to
70 	 naming
69 69 69 69 	 your course but I
70 70 70 	 try go with
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 something that's catchy but that's also searchable
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you don't want make it like film for free fright at it I don't know that was like a really bad example something that's
69 	 super
70 70 70 70 70 	 cute so you like LJ's
69 	 mystery
70 70 	 course or
69 	 something
70 	 that's
69 	 so
66 	 bad
69 69 69 69 69 	 oh my gosh something stupid
66 66 	 like that
69 69 	 you wanted
70 70 	 to be
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 searchable you know if people are looking for course about video for business want them to able to find it the research I also
70 70 70 70 	 determine the price point
69 69 69 69 	 before I start it
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 and again this is a working price point right you might go back and forth as you get into the course you might realize oh
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 my gosh I poured a lot of
70 	 material
67 67 67 67 67 	 in here I need to
66 66 66 	 up that price
67 	 or
69 69 69 	 you know maybe
70 	 this
69 69 	 was a
70 	 lot
69 69 69 	 quicker and lot
66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 	 shorter than I it going be maybe I'll I'll make it a little bit so
69 69 	 this is
66 	 just
67 67 67 67 	 a starting point but
69 	 I
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 like to have the starting point in mind when I'm craving the course so that I'm not creating
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 Kors for $15 right so that's going to depend on a lot of things are going to want do little bit competitive research and see what other courses in your Niche are selling for you may want to survey your audience potentially fuel yes or no about that when comes to pricing because obviously I think like
70 	 if
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 anyone were to ask how much do you want to pay for something I'm
39 	 just
40 40 	 going say
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 $5 to break even though could afford more than $5 so take with grain of salt I think if you're going survey audience
67 67 	 but you
69 	 can
70 70 70 70 70 	 go buy data as well
69 	 so
78 	 go
69 69 69 	 by your site
78 	 data
69 69 69 69 69 	 see what your average conversion
39 	 on
40 	 your
70 70 70 	 website is see
69 	 what
70 70 	 your conversion
69 69 	 rate is
42 42 	 on your
39 	 website
48 	 I
78 78 	 do like
39 39 	 said I
48 	 have
69 69 69 	 three other courses
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 and I also have a coaching program and things like that so I can kind of understand where
40 	 my
39 	 audience
70 70 70 	 at in terms
69 	 of
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 price point and I've helped the people now to make horses and coaching programs so
69 69 	 I can
70 	 talk
79 	 to
69 69 69 69 	 them I can pull
78 78 	 aside individual
69 69 	 people and
78 	 say
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 what do think about that so do
39 	 some
66 66 	 research on
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 price price point I decided to
43 	 a
70 70 70 70 70 	 mini core so I wanted
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 to this really affordable for folks so
70 70 70 70 70 	 I decided on between 15
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and $25 and it landed on
66 	 25
67 67 67 67 67 	 because I ended up doing
66 	 what
69 69 69 69 	 I said in the
66 66 	 beginning where
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 was like pouring a lot more content into it than had originally planned. Okay 5 is still super super affordable other
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 thing with pricing is that you always discount
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 it right I can always create a
70 	 coupon
69 69 	 for $10
48 	 and
66 	 and
69 	 it
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 a lot cheaper and then last two
69 	 things
70 70 70 70 	 that I did were
69 	 outlined
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 course so this was really just brain dump on day one I didn't want to be like I was typing out word for word what I was going to say or anything like that up for an initial outline and go through and figure out what you want your modules to be and
69 69 	 what you
66 	 want
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 your lessons to be so module is like a chapter essentially so
66 	 I
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 have a module on equipment have a module on
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 pre-production on production and post-production on promotion these
69 69 	 are all
39 	 modules
66 	 are
78 	 like
69 69 	 chapters overarching
70 70 70 	 themes and then
69 	 within
70 	 that
66 	 I
69 	 have
70 70 	 lesson so
69 	 4
70 70 70 70 	 equipment I a sample
66 	 equipment
69 69 69 	 list that you
70 70 	 shop from
69 69 	 I have
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 a tutorial on three-point lighting I have what else is in there been on what what must have equipment you have to
69 	 have
42 	 that
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 kind of so those all individual lessons I didn't write out the
69 	 content
70 70 	 for each
69 69 69 	 of those things
70 70 70 70 	 during this outline I
69 	 just
42 	 wrote
43 	 down
69 69 	 module 1
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 equipment cameras lighting like that kind of thing and I
39 	 use
66 	 Evernote
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to do this I just create like little notepad
69 	 or
67 67 67 67 67 	 whatever it's a note page
39 39 	 in evernote's
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and that's what do and then also came up with the look in the feel of the course so I went through some different slide templates you
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 can use site like Ken but you can use site like slides Carnival to find free slideshows and I just like to have an idea
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 of the look and feel of the course before I
70 70 	 get too
69 69 69 69 69 	 deep it too cuz that
70 	 all
69 	 contributes
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to like the vibe of it and what you're going to include I know it sounds kind of weird
69 	 but
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 if have like super business Eve professional-looking
69 69 	 course I'm
70 70 	 not going
69 69 69 69 69 	 maybe add a certain things
70 	 about
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 memes are like whatever I might want include
66 66 66 66 66 66 	 you know what mean so I
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 like to come up with things all on
66 66 66 	 day one on
69 69 	 day 2
66 66 66 	 of this is
69 69 	 pretty simple
66 66 	 but I
69 69 69 	 went through and
70 70 70 	 I created on
67 67 	 my side
66 	 so
69 69 69 	 once I had
66 66 	 my slideshow
69 	 you
66 66 66 	 know templates in
69 	 mind
66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 	 I went through and I populated those lies
69 69 69 	 and what you
66 66 66 66 	 want do for this
69 69 69 69 	 is if you've ever
66 	 given
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 a speech or like a presentation at school
66 	 or
69 	 at
70 	 work
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 or whatever do the same thing you're not
70 70 	 going type
69 69 69 	 out every single
70 	 word
66 66 66 66 66 66 66 	 that you're to stay on to that
70 70 70 70 	 slide deck you're good
69 	 just
66 66 66 	 going to highlight
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 those keep points out in some images boom
69 	 shouldn't
66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 	 take too too long depending on length of the course like said mine was kind of a mini horse I think I ended up with
69 	 35
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 slides something like that at which actually
69 69 69 69 	 is a lot again
70 	 like
69 69 69 	 I it more
70 	 than
69 	 I
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 intended originally wanted it to like
69 	 10
66 66 	 or 15
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 but anyway it on day two
69 69 	 is actually
70 70 70 70 70 	 recorded my camera videos no
69 	 this
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 is optional courses don't necessarily need to have
69 	 a
70 70 70 	 doctor camera videos
69 69 	 they don't
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 necessarily need to have slides actually you could do one or
69 69 	 other or
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 some other you know could do audio course of taking those before but I like
69 	 to
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 have a little bit a combination
69 	 between
70 70 	 slides and
66 	 me
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 talking to the camera just because I think it adds a little bits
69 	 of
70 70 	 a connection
69 69 	 to experience
70 	 and
69 	 especially
70 	 considering
66 	 my
48 	 course
78 	 I'm
70 70 70 	 creating that I
39 	 created
69 69 69 69 	 is all about video
66 	 I
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 thought it made sense actually demonstrate
66 66 66 66 66 66 66 	 some video so I did a simple
48 	 talking
66 66 	 head video
69 	 which
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 just like me sitting and I did it in front of
69 69 69 	 the backdrop because
70 	 I
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 just moved if you guys are new here I just moved apartments on my office is actually not set up my lighting is not set up
70 70 	 perfectly yet
69 69 69 	 so I just
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 use a backdrop and I actually in
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 this course that I created which is live and ready
40 	 to
43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 	 purchase now I'll leave it in the link down below actually went through exactly the
69 69 69 	 equipment I used
70 	 to
69 69 69 	 get those shots
70 	 how
43 43 	 to set
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 the lighting to get that shot and everything so pretty easy to
69 	 do
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 but I set aside a for that and I really want I'm
69 	 outlining
39 	 my
70 70 	 course I
43 	 can
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 switch it back up a bit on day one as I'm outlining those courses I'm taking note of which one which of those sins would be a good director camera video you know some things like the lighting video for example
69 69 69 69 	 I could have made
70 	 a
69 	 slight
70 	 about
69 	 it
70 70 70 	 but like it's
69 69 	 hard really
70 	 show
69 	 how
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 to properly light a shot without just
69 69 69 69 	 showing it right so
70 70 70 	 I knew that
69 69 69 69 69 	 lighting was going to be
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 a director camera video slash a kind behind-the-scenes video showing the actual equipment being set up that
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 kind thing so yeah that's all I
67 67 67 67 	 and a populated the
66 	 slides
69 69 	 then on
48 	 day
66 	 three
69 69 	 I went
78 	 through
69 69 69 	 as recorded my
70 	 over
69 	 so
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 recording voice over essentially what do
69 69 	 is I
39 39 	 export that
48 48 48 	 slideshow into either
39 	 a
69 69 69 	 PDF or a
70 70 70 70 	 PowerPoint presentation whatever you
69 69 	 prefer and
43 43 43 	 then it goes
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 through and I screen record the presentation and I attach a microphone so there's a lot of
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 different microphones out there that you purchase I do
70 70 70 	 recommend using a
39 	 microphone
69 	 if
70 70 	 you can
69 69 	 this microphone
70 70 70 	 is not really
69 69 69 	 perfect the kind
70 	 like
69 	 picked
70 	 up
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 lot background noise and like this you can
70 70 70 	 probably hear but
39 	 it's
48 48 48 48 	 better than into my
39 39 39 39 39 39 39 	 computer or talking even into like my
48 	 camera
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 microphone is a lot it's lot better in opinion sounding
78 	 choose
69 	 some
42 	 kind
39 39 39 39 	 showcase all the microphones
40 40 40 40 	 that I use for
39 	 voice
40 40 40 	 overs for filming
39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 	 videos and stuff like that to just make sure that your your
40 	 microphone
39 39 	 is attached
69 	 to
39 39 39 39 	 your screen recording program
69 69 69 69 69 	 should I use it I
66 	 use
39 39 39 39 39 39 	 QuickTime you can also use a
42 42 42 42 42 42 	 loom loom is really cool tool
39 39 	 because you
43 43 	 can show
40 	 your
39 39 39 39 	 face while your screen
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 recording so that's kind of nice if
69 	 maybe
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 don't want to set up for a full-on dropped the camera video but still
69 69 69 	 want to pop
70 70 	 in and
66 	 show
69 69 	 your face
66 	 once
67 67 67 	 in so I
69 69 	 choose between
66 66 	 those programs
69 	 it
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 doesn't matter what you and just make sure
69 	 that
66 66 66 	 you select your
69 	 microphone
66 66 66 	 when you go
69 	 to
66 66 66 	 screen record so
69 	 it
70 70 	 doesn't just
69 	 pick
66 66 66 66 	 up on your laptop
69 69 69 69 	 or iMac or whatever
70 	 audio
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 then what you're going do is
66 	 they're
69 	 to
67 67 67 	 export that screen
70 70 70 	 going add it
69 	 into
78 78 	 you know
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 bumping the table whatever like just
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 clean it up a bit and
70 	 then
51 51 51 	 I export every
42 42 42 	 lesson individually so
51 	 if
70 	 do
79 	 lesson
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 on storyboarding that's one video and then I do another lesson on production
69 69 69 69 69 	 schedules that's another lesson or
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 another video files I asked for all of the individual video files and the reason
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I did is because once you get
66 	 into
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 your course platform you will upload
66 66 	 them and
69 	 in
70 70 70 	 your kind of
69 69 	 organize them
70 70 70 	 based modules and
67 	 lessons
69 69 69 69 69 	 a little confusing to explain
66 	 but
69 69 69 69 	 hopefully trying something on
70 	 the
69 	 screen
39 39 	 here that
40 40 	 will help
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 you out a little bit I had it with final Kotb can
43 43 43 43 	 use a program like
40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 	 iMovie again in my new course I show a detailed tutorial on iMovie cuz they're really easy one to First learn on so that's what are you there and
70 70 70 70 	 then the last thing
69 69 	 I really
70 	 do
69 	 is
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 add it to my core spot form so I've been using thinkific for
69 69 	 the past
70 70 70 70 	 few years that's why
69 69 69 69 	 I launch my very
48 	 first
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 course and I'm pretty happy with it it's a really
67 67 67 67 	 easy to use pot
66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 	 my mean it's little overwhelming when you first
69 69 	 get in
70 	 but
39 	 once
67 	 you
70 	 figure
40 	 out
39 	 create
48 48 48 	 a new course
66 66 	 then like
51 51 	 said you
42 	 just
69 	 upload
70 	 those
69 69 69 69 	 individual video files you
70 	 can
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 also add other media hype so I did some of extra things that I did kind bond A4 and
70 	 A5
69 69 69 	 is that created
70 	 some
69 69 	 additional PDF
66 66 66 66 	 so wanted to create
69 	 like
70 	 a
69 	 a
70 70 70 70 70 	 storyboarding PDF for you guys
39 39 39 39 	 I created in equipment
70 70 70 70 	 list I created some
39 	 additional
66 	 almost
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 like blog posts within the course that referenced other content
69 	 before
70 70 70 	 going on to
39 	 lesson
69 	 6
70 	 module
66 	 6
39 39 	 or whatever
69 69 69 	 the case so
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 those are additional things you can do like
48 	 text
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 you can do PDFs you can do downloads you
70 70 70 70 70 70 	 do a bunch I think you
43 43 43 	 can do audio
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 files there's a lot different you do and get back to you. It's really
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 easy and it's pretty good I also
66 66 	 have I
69 	 believe
66 66 	 I have
69 	 a
70 70 	 referral link
67 	 that
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 I'll link down below if you guys
69 	 want
39 	 sign
70 	 up
69 	 and
70 70 70 	 experience their Pro
66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 66 	 Plan for I think it's a month so I do have that
69 69 69 69 69 	 for guys know I don't
66 66 66 	 I get paid
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 for it or I think it's just like f to you I'm really sure but yeah that's
69 	 pretty
70 70 70 	 much all there
69 69 69 69 69 	 is to it and then
70 	 from
69 	 there
70 70 70 70 	 you really just set
69 	 up
39 	 your
69 	 thinkific
70 70 	 landing page
69 69 69 	 and you do
70 70 70 	 make it look
69 	 pretty
70 70 70 	 maybe take some
67 	 photo
70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 	 add your pricing details in it there and then from there you're really ready to launch so it makes pretty easy for you and I really liked using that platform again not sponsored just what I use personally but there's a bajillion other ways you could do either Padilla is a really good one I really like their pot form as well you also sell a course just yourself like if you want to just share the file you can do that so there's lots of different that can do it I've really inspired by
69 69 69 69 69 	 those of you guys who
70 	 were
69 69 	 a little
70 	 bit

66 	 and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 I will talk to you in the next
70 	 one
69 	 by
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 online courses there's no topic quite as controversial
69 	 as
42 42 	 online courses
69 	 you
78 	 know
72 	 there
69 	 are
72 	 two
69 	 types
78 	 in
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 there's a type of people who criticize online courses and caught them
78 78 78 78 	 scans and they just
51 51 51 	 met on all
78 	 of
69 69 	 this stuff
78 	 saying
69 	 that
72 72 	 it's total
42 42 	 waste of
69 69 69 	 time and you
72 72 72 	 should never pay
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 anything online because all content should be free the internet has
42 	 so
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 much content everything should just be free and then there's the second type of person who
72 	 pays
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 and get as many online courses that they feel are going be relevant to their life and you
72 	 know
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 these people are just buying up all online courses that they think are going to be useful for them and you know maybe they'll pick up 325 online courses each one may be causing a few hundred bucks here there and they'll put in the time and effort into learning and let me ask you a who do you think after
72 72 	 five years
69 69 69 69 69 	 is going to be rich
72 72 72 	 who do you
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 think's going to have the highest chance of really getting Firehead the person is just being negative and criticizing
72 72 	 all of
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 these education programs and are so hesitant to spend money to invest themselves they don't want to descendants of that out because they think that money should be spent for for what consumption to buy themselves a car or two by themselves taste your food or a PlayStation
66 	 or
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 do you think it's going to the
42 42 	 person who
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 didn't hesitate to invest in themselves to buy themselves books knowledge information videos equipment gear or
66 	 exclusive
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 access to mentors and coaches who could really give them private information
66 	 about
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 how the world really works at 13th and everything that
66 66 	 they knew
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 about the paths they themselves may want to walk in life and you know the thing is undoubtedly there's going be some scenarios where education Investments are not necessarily going to pay off Maybe not immediately and so you may feel that maybe there a waste money there so let me ask you for example when you see somebody go to a four-year degree maybe they put into college this whole college experience which they party and a major and some useless degree or maybe it wasn't even that useless but it was just the opportunities in the job market has just went there for them at the time that they came out and then they end up with
78 78 	 no job
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 or maybe they're even to work one two years and then they get laid off and they end up as a Uber driver not
78 78 	 using their
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 education at all would you call a
78 	 waste
69 69 69 69 	 money saying somebody having
72 	 spent
78 	 on
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 themselves for very little return and this happens all the time and
78 78 78 78 78 	 so I would say that
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 yes that could be waste of
78 	 money
69 	 and
78 	 generally
69 	 investing
78 78 78 	 in yourself can
69 69 69 69 	 a double-edged sword we
78 	 need
69 69 69 69 	 to really understand yourself
78 	 most
69 69 	 important and
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 I think you yourself need to be willing to put in the
69 69 	 time and
78 78 78 78 78 78 	 effort and commitment and have the
69 	 passion
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 and interest in a certain topic to really push it through because the fact anything
69 	 you
78 	 do
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 generally does require work even running a YouTube channel it could
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 take 8 to 12 hours just put together a single
69 	 10
78 78 	 minute video
69 	 sometimes
78 78 78 78 78 	 I thought you have to
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 ask yourself are you the type
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 of person who's willing to put in sit down it's hours
69 69 	 a day
78 78 	 maybe to
69 69 	 work on
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 the YouTube video and if you're not
66 66 66 66 	 then no much information
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 or knowledge that you get your not going to be to be come a spectacular YouTube Creator from taking you to court for example or similarly learning coding data structures and algorithms such that you can land a job at the top-tier tech company like Facebook or Google so that's other program I teach for techinterviewpro.com do think about that too is it you need to be willing to sit down and learn the data structures and algorithms I can point you in the right
69 69 	 direction really
78 	 coach
69 69 69 69 	 and Mentor you along
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 the tell you what you to know
69 	 what
78 78 78 78 	 you don't need to
69 69 69 	 know all of
78 	 the
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 traps and pitfalls that other more careless candidates may fall into the first one to three or four times that the interview until they finally learn how their
78 	 supposed
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 to answer some of these questions and what people are looking for but at the of the day still have to be the person to walk that path and you still have to put in the time to study and to learn and if you're the type of person who doesn't
78 78 78 78 	 really and put in
69 69 69 69 	 the time and effort
78 78 78 	 and work then
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 no matter what you try in life you probably won't succeed at that right you still have to allocate time I would say I don't know 1 2 3 hours day to just practice and
78 	 get
69 	 good
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 at whatever rapper passion you want to get good at now
69 	 for
78 78 78 	 myself I tend
69 	 be
78 78 78 78 78 78 	 very self-motivated and her I would
69 69 69 69 	 learn Japanese all by
78 	 myself
69 69 69 69 69 	 I did my own self
78 	 study
69 69 69 69 69 	 program I tried to learn
78 	 in
69 	 French
78 78 78 78 78 78 	 on my own I would learn
69 69 69 69 	 guitar on my own
78 	 and
69 69 69 69 	 some of these things
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 to learn it on your you know like in some of these
69 	 Ventures
78 78 78 	 I actually felt
69 69 69 69 	 right like was not
78 78 78 	 able to learn
69 69 69 	 French or guitar
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 very well and part of that is because I just lost motivation
69 69 	 along the
78 78 	 way I
69 69 	 didn't really
78 78 78 	 know to do
69 	 and
78 	 there
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 were good online programs at least at the time
78 78 78 78 78 	 I was learning these to
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 really figure out how to do
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 these and you're like I did myself and that
69 69 69 69 	 time and therefore may
66 	 be
69 69 69 69 	 because of that I
78 78 	 did not
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 get good however I do remember one time and it took me like a year of thinking I actually invested in myself and got myself a MacBook Pro even though I did not need the laptop I had a fully functioning PC laptop and I had this very cheap in mindset in me it was like oh I don't want to spend money I don't want spend money on anyting I only want to spend
78 	 the
69 	 cheapest
66 	 amount
69 69 69 	 of money possible
78 	 on
69 	 the

69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 scenes in which I do a ton of research and ensure

69 	 higher
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 positions in my Tech Career and so I think part
69 	 of
78 	 the
69 	 issue
78 78 	 is that
69 69 	 online courses
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 and really education in general has returns that can vary
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 from anywhere from zero returns to millions in
78 	 return
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 is right like I can set you on a totally path and really help you achieve success and
78 78 78 	 it really just
69 69 69 	 depends on the
78 	 person
69 	 and
78 78 	 how you
69 	 apply
78 78 78 78 78 78 	 that skill the knowledge that you
69 	 learn
78 78 78 	 and having Run
69 	 online
78 78 	 courses for
69 69 69 	 about 2 years
78 	 now
69 69 69 	 I've met how
78 	 many
69 69 	 different types
78 	 of
69 69 69 69 69 	 people but there's two types
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 of people I want to highlight for you the first
69 	 type
78 78 78 78 	 is the type who
69 	 I've
78 	 heard
69 69 69 69 69 	 you mention they never seem
78 	 to
69 69 69 69 	 want to invest themselves
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 well of course they have no problem buying the latest iPhone they have no problem by the latest sneakers or buying some really expensive dinner at some
69 69 	 restaurant steaks
78 78 78 78 	 wine the latest stereo
51 	 speakers
42 42 42 42 	 fashion drugs they're even
51 51 51 51 51 	 spend tens thousands hundreds thousands
78 78 	 dollars under
51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 	 on the education under colleges and yet they won't go the extra little distance to put
78 	 some
51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 	 of their own money and invested in themselves they're okay their parents pay their college basically but for them to invest
48 48 48 48 48 	 in their own Futures well
51 51 51 51 51 51 	 that would require them to be
48 48 	 accountable and
51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 	 responsible and to really believe in themselves to really want to help themselves and know people cannot help you if you're not willing to help yourself like let's pretend you're
48 48 	 at the
51 51 51 	 beginning of a
48 48 	 math and
51 51 	 a person
69 	 says
51 51 51 51 51 51 51 	 what you have to pay an entry
42 42 42 	 fee for this
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 marathon is going to be the hundredth hour marathon and then you've people are saying they don't even to pay the entrance fee 12th there's
69 69 69 	 to be countless
78 78 78 78 78 	 hours of time training and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 effort that has a I'm in after that as well and
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 you're not even willing to pay the entrance fee. Then you have to
69 69 	 ask yourself
78 	 what
51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 	 are you really trying to do with your what you trying
78 78 78 	 accomplish it maybe
51 51 	 it's time
78 	 that
69 	 you
78 78 78 78 78 	 up game or to get
51 51 	 serious about
78 78 78 78 78 	 what you're trying do in
51 	 life
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 and then the second type of person I've ever encountered is the
72 	 type
78 78 	 of person
72 72 72 	 maybe they have
78 	 their
69 	 intentions
72 72 72 72 72 	 of right place they want
69 69 69 	 to work hard
78 	 is
69 69 69 69 69 	 not really at their level
72 72 	 you know
69 69 69 69 69 	 there some people who come
72 72 	 they're super
69 69 69 69 	 experienced super senior and
78 	 so
51 51 	 programs everything
69 	 they
51 	 got
72 72 72 72 	 you know some these
69 	 people
78 78 78 78 	 they be experienced overleveled
69 69 69 69 69 	 maybe they even though more
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 than me although not quite likely but
69 69 	 in that
78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 	 scenario I would say that the program is not going to
69 69 	 very helpful
72 72 	 for them
69 	 operatives
70 	 of
69 69 	 this where
70 	 you
69 69 69 	 have some people
72 72 72 72 72 	 who basic or they're not
69 69 	 for example
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 maybe are not very computer text Savvy at reason why
78 	 back
72 72 72 72 72 72 	 if for any reason person is
48 48 48 48 	 and so different types
72 	 people
48 48 	 internet right
72 72 	 programmer course
69 	 online
48 	 access
72 72 72 72 	 going for and the
70 70 70 	 for all of
69 	 programs
72 72 72 72 72 	 run like to build online
69 69 	 learning communities
78 	 around
69 69 69 	 the private exclusive
72 72 	 Facebook groups
48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 	 where students can get together Sunday together share
72 72 	 information topics
69 	 and
72 72 	 learn together
48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 	 and so it doesn't make much sense to have enter community who may think the advanced
69 	 them
72 	 or
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 two days for them or whatever
72 72 72 72 72 72 	 reason is to satisfied I do
48 48 48 48 	 situation to flexible for
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 now overall I did once that to just every
78 78 78 	 not going get
48 	 for
72 	 them
48 48 48 	 for trying to
72 	 and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 you know what overall. They'll probably be on
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 a higher path a few setting up for
69 	 a
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 different trajectory and I wouldn't be surprised to see
69 	 sort
72 72 	 of this
69 69 	 crabs in
72 72 	 the bucket
69 	 type
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 of Warcraft tried to put each other down whenever one escape get little bit out and don't be
70 	 that
72 72 	 crap like
69 69 	 they want
72 72 72 72 72 72 	 to go at it race set
48 48 48 48 48 48 48 	 the totally trajectory over the just find
72 72 72 72 72 72 	 that productivity not over I do
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 recommend when you purchase anything to
72 72 72 	 check out their
69 69 69 	 return policy make
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 sure that you can read can something get refund if for any reason you're not happy with whatever
69 69 69 	 they're providing and
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 there's also credit card at this beats so anytime try something to your give that it wasn't right or proper
69 69 69 69 69 	 you can oftentimes as your
72 	 credit
69 69 69 69 69 69 	 card company to investigate that to
72 72 72 72 	 challenge the charge and
69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 	 they can help you investigate that and reverse
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 the charge as well so they'll do for
69 69 	 me but
72 	 let
78 	 on
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 online programs are courses have you taken any that you really
69 69 69 69 	 recommend for me I
72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 	 know I took the jump Cuts series which was really pretty good actually. Let me in the comments below I'll see there
69 	 if
78 78 78 	 like the video
