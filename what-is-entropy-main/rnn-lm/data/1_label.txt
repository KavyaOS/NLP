<a> hi my name is amy aniovi and i'm a
<f> writer producer
<f> i'm currently a co-executive producer on
<f> season three of insecure
<f> and before that i worked on
<f> a show called brothers in atlanta at hbo
<e> and also silicon valley season two
<c> and the michael j fox show and trial and
<c> error on nbc
<a> and awkward black girl
<a> if if you feel like you're interested in
<a> writing and maybe
<a> are not quite like uh should i take a
<a> class there are so many books about
<a> writing
<a> out there like i know for television
<a> there's a book by ellen sandler called
<h> the tv writers workbook
<a> and it helps like break down how to
<a> write a spec script a spectrum being
<a> like your own version
<a> of an existing tv show and that was like
<h> essential to me
<a> there's also pamela douglas has a book
<a> called tv drama that breaks down how to
write a
<a> television drama script in um four or
<a> five or six acts
<a> um and that was super helpful too um i
<a> did a lot there are also like free
<h> resources like even if you're like i
<h> don't have five
<h> dollars to cram together to buy a book i
<a> just want to learn something literally
<a> how do you write a screenplay
<a> it's online and then i just started
<a> reading all these
<h> sources and realizing that i needed a
<a> network like it wasn't enough to be
<a> in like you know a closet reading stuff
<a> online and watching tv alone having a
<a> network of people around you
<a> is so much more helpful um but it
<f> doesn't mean that you have to have an
<f> mfa like i always told my parents my
<f> parents
<f> like when i got by mfa they're like now
<f> when you get a sign-on bonus and i was
<f> like uh what that's not a thing
<e> um it doesn't give you anything except
like
<e> all it does is make sure that you'll
<e> never be a doctor
<g> this town like hollywood is filled with
<g> way more people who
<g> don't have writing degrees who are doing
<g> great
<g> uh it's not like a no it's not like a
<g> prescribed thing like go get a degree
<g> and then you become a writer that's not
<g> a thing it's really just
<g> right write write write write if getting
<a> a degree helps you write more great
<a> if being in a writer's group helps you
<a> write more great if reading books online
<c> or websites or watching youtube
<h> tutorials helps you write more
<h> great just right
<a> sort of like a weird thing where it
<a> happens when it's supposed to happen
<a> and i find that if you're actually
<h> looking for agents and looking for
<h> managers
<a> very often you end up with what's kind
<h> of like a false positive
<a> people who are looking for anyone find
<a> you
<a> because you're looking for anyone and
<f> then sometimes it's not actually a match
<f> to see that like if you're with people
<f> who understand what you're doing and
<f> want the same things as you
<h> your peers your truest friends um
<h> it is helpful because then you rise
<h> together
<h> the way i think of agents and managers
<h> uh because i've talked a little bit
<h> about like
<a> which one what you need or what you have
<a> i always think of it as
<a> an agent closes the deal
<a> for the job that you want or got and a
<h> manager
<a> guides you to the relationships that get
<a> you the deal
<a> a manager also manages your career and
<a> an agent manages this contract um
<a> i think you are responsible for your
<h> work as they say like
<a> an agent takes ten percent of your
<h> salary so they do ten percent of the
<a> work
<a> um same thing for managers either take
<a> ten or five you're responsible for the
<a> writing
<a> so anytime i've had a friend be like i
<a> called my agent was like what were they
doing for me
<h> i'm like you got to give them a contract
<g> for them to do something for you
<g> like you are responsible for your career
<g> so it's kind of one of those things
where
<g> you have to be doing the thing for
<g> people to give you
<g> the ability to do the thing and i think
<d> representation
<d> isn't something that you should be
<d> running after honestly i think it should
<g> be something that
<a> is in the background you need to be
<a> doing the work do the work do the work
<a> do the work
<a> and eventually the reps will be calling
<a> you i think one of the biggest things to
<h> look for is who else they represent
<h> and do they represent people whose
<a> careers you want i literally
<f> like when i was on happy endings i was
<f> in a room of 16 writers
<h> the day before i started the job i
<h> looked up all the credits
<h> and i looked up who represented them and
<a> it's literally as simple as like if you
<h> have something like imdb
<h> pro or studio system you can look it up
like for real
<h> but i was like literally like jonathan
<h> groff repped by into google
<h> hey it comes up so you can do that with
<a> anyone it's like rep by blah blah blah
<a> if they've ever been written about
<a> somewhere it says who the rep dot or you
<a> know like agency
<a> agent whatever um and i looked up
<d> everyone
<f> and all the people and also like movies
<f> that were coming out and tv shows i
<a> loved i would
<a> watch the credits and write down the
<a> names of the writers and i'd look up who
<a> repped them
<f> and i realized like all the funniest
<c> people all the people whose careers i
<c> wanted were wrapped at uta
<b> and i was like oh i want to be at uta
<b> there are a few rounds of staffing
<b> meetings that happen
<b> um the first round is called generals
<b> and the second are called
<b> staffing meetings uh generals are when
they're
<b> they're like the water bottle tour you
<h> go to different production companies and
<h> studios and you just meet executives
<b> usually junior executives to start out
<b> or coordinators which are the people who
<b> help
<b> the upper level executives and they're
<b> really just like meet and greets they're
<b> kind of like first dates
<b> and uh they're very casual uh
<b> you should just like dress nice but
<c> dress like you don't wear a suit
<c> um because no one in hollywood wears
<c> suits except agents
<h> and uh and you always take the water
<f> because you never know if your mouth is
<b> going to get dry
<b> when you go you are basically the number
<a> one question you'll get in a general is
<a> so tell me about you and your job is to
<a> tell
<a> your whole life story in like a minute
<d> so we call that an
<a> elevator pitch it's basically the name
<a> is given from like if you had one ride
<a> in an elevator from the bottom floor to
<a> the top floor of a building
<a> talk about yourself what would you say
<a> uh so an example is i'm always like
<a> well i'm from dallas texas uh i was
<a> raised in a very nigerian home so didn't
own my first
<a> pair of cowboy boots until i got to
<g> college uh and i basically decided very
<h> early that i wanted to disappoint my
<g> nigerian
<h> parents by not becoming a doctor instead
<h> i became a comedy writer
<g> that's sort of my elevator pitch and
<g> then you can elucidate from there like
<g> where you went to school
<g> usually they'll prompt you with
<g> questions but it really is just like
<g> talking about you and saying a little
<g> bit about yourself
<g> other common questions are what type of
<g> shows if if it's for tv
<f> what type of shows do you like to watch
<h> uh what is your favorite show on
<g> television what type of shows do you
like to write
<g> what kind of writer are you where are
<h> you from where do you get inspiration
<h> for your stories
<a> are you single they don't ask that
<a> after you've passed the generals round
<d> basically once the lower level exacts
<a> have agreed that you are worthy of
<a> meeting
<a> you kind of go up to the staffing round
<a> which is with like development execs and
<a> managers and
<a> um sometimes even like vps
<f> of comedy or drama based on your field
<f> another important thing to remember is
<f> if they do ask what type of writer you
<h> are in television it's actually pretty
<a> important to choose a side
<a> comedy or drama um when you're starting
out
<f> eventually you can write anything but
<f> when you're starting they very much like
<f> to put you in a box
<h> so uh pick your side and you can do it
<f> like i did just literally look at the
<f> stuff you've written and the stuff you
<f> watch
<f> and say that's what you do and then
<f> continue to write that
<f> for the foreseeable future until uh
<f> you've gotten some traction in that
<f> field and then you can move over to the
<f> other side
<f> um so once you start meeting with those
execs
<f> they'll be asking you which of our shows
<a> do you like to watch which of our shows
<f> are your favorites which of
<a> our shows do you want to work on that
<a> means not only what's currently on
<a> television but also what's in
<f> development at their network
<f> which are like pilot scripts things that
<f> other people have read
<f> or written for them maybe like some
<f> development projects
<f> you can usually get those scripts by
<d> googling or from getting them from like
<h> your reps
<h> um and then from there if you pass
<a> that round of meetings then you get
<a> producer meetings and show runner
<a> meetings that's when you're meeting with
<a> the show that you want to work on
<a> so for instance you go in for a meeting
<h> with the showrunner of happy endings
<a> and he says what's your favorite episode
<a> of this show and you probably should
<a> have watched it and can talk about it at
length
<a> but again it's just about being yourself
<f> because really all of these meetings are
<f> people deciding do i want to stay hang
<f> out in a room with you for 10 hours a
<a> day
<a> because that's really the job do you
<f> have a personality that makes me want to
<f> be around you
<f> or makes me not if you have a great
<f> personality you're at an advantage
<f> if you don't maybe work in features
<f> as a writer in the room your individual
<f> responsibility
<f> is to uh be positive
<f> to be on time and to always be listening
<f> um and if you're listening well then you
<f> get to a place where you feel
<f> comfortable pitching
<f> i think sometimes it's scary when you're
<f> new to pitch i had someone say
<f> if you do nothing else ask someone how
<f> their day is going
<d> and i literally when i was a staff
<a> writer was terrified every day that i
<a> was going to lose my job and i thought i
<a> was alone there's this myth out there
<f> that there's this perfect staff writer
<f> who's killing it and is the funniest
<f> person in the room and gets all their
<f> pitches in
<f> it's a myth that person doesn't exist so
<a> get that out of your head
<f> really everyone is nervous when they're
<f> new and i would say
<f> sometimes i'm like today my goal is to
<f> talk to make one person laugh
<f> today my goal is to make a joke about
lunch
<f> today my goal and it was like these
<a> little things
<f> that were so like but i was just so
<f> scared especially when you're at the
<b> bottom and i was the only black person
<b> in my first room
<b> uh one of not very many women so it was
<c> just like
<c> hard
<c> i think the first thing that i always do
<c> is go to my writer's group first
<b> i'll email my friends who i meet with
<b> and talk writing with
<b> and say hey so i had an idea for a show
<b> what do you guys think about this
<b> and because i like to get feedback from
<b> writers first i think that writers like
<b> think about things differently
<b> than your reps do sometimes your reps
<b> think about if it's sellable
<b> um if it's marketable whereas your
<b> writer friends will think about
<b> is it right for you to write you know is
<b> it matching your voice
<b> is it something that they can see that
<b> you're passionate about
<b> and i think that's very good a barometer
<b> for whether or not you should develop it
<b> once i get kind of like the okay from my
<b> writers group then i'll
<b> send a log line to my agents and say hey
<b> look i had this idea for a show
<b> it's a drama about like two women
<b> like firefighters whatever um
<b> and they'll say well you know there's a
<b> female firefighter pitch that's
<b> happening is
<b> spin-off of burn notice or whatever you
know
<b> at fx so that already exists but what's
<b> your take
<b> and then you're like well here's my
<h> version um and then
<a> if they like it usually what they do is
<a> say
<a> hey this sounds really cool can you
<d> write like a one sheet pitch
<h> like and it's not a fully fleshed out
<f> pitch it's just sort of like why you
<a> care about this
<f> who the main character would be what is
<a> the show kind of like
<a> um and usually you do that like in one
<a> page
<a> and then they'll use that to send to
<a> production companies
<a> um to uh maybe even like some
<a> execs and see if people are interested
<c> in it um
<f> i find that like there you get to a
<f> certain level i think we're sort
<c> of like you can be the one who brings it
<f> yourself to
<f> the studio or to the network and say hey
<a> guys i'd like to pitch you guys this
<a> thing directly just from me
<f> but i think sometimes there's some value
<a> added and like getting to walk into the
<a> room with somebody else
<a> so getting to have like a production
<b> company on your side is kind of cool
<b> and so usually they'll send it to a
<b> production company and then you meet
<d> with them
<b> you work out the pitch together and then
<b> it becomes a fully fledged pitch
<b> it goes from that one page version to
<b> like more of like a
<b> six seven eight maybe 10 15 page version
<b> which is covering every aspect of what
<b> the show would be
<b> why you why now what the show is
<d> is about what the log line is who the
<b> main characters are what's the style of
<b> the show what's the tone of the show
<c> what are we going to be seeing week to
<c> week what's the breakdown of what the
<c> pilot is like literally what's going to
<c> happen
<c> um through the pilot what are the act
<c> breaks what are the things that make it
<c> sing what are the things that make it
<c> different
<c> and then wrapping up like why it means
<f> something to you and why
<c> it matters um and that sort of thing is
<f> usually like a 10 to 15 maybe sometimes
<f> even a 20 minute pitch
<f> which is like long it's a lot of talking
<f> it's like more talking than i've done
<c> today
<b> but like if you get that done um
<d> and it's good then you get to pitch a
<d> show and maybe even sell
<b> a show one of the
<b> biggest the number one phrase that every
<b> writer should learn
<b> is let me take a look at that as opposed
<b> to fighting in the moment the note as
<b> opposed to pushing back on people who
are
<b> really there to help you it's important
<b> to just be able to say i need to step
back
<d> i'm feeling sensitive they're talking
<d> about my main character who is based on
<b> me and this hurts
<b> and so you can just say good point let
<b> me take a look at that
<b> and then you go get to go away and sit
<b> with your feelings and figure it out for
<b> yourself um it's also
<h> important to realize that very often
<h> especially when you're getting notes
<h> from people who aren't writers
<h> the note isn't the thing to listen to
<h> there's something called the note behind
<a> the note
<a> which is basically they might pitch you
<a> something that you're like what
<a> but really there's a note behind the
<a> note they're giving so for instance they
<d> might say
<d> hey you know you have like your main
<d> character jenna falling in love with
<d> brandon on page five
<d> is there something to be said for like
<d> maybe
<d> brandon is a woman and you're like oh
<h> well this is
<h> based on my first marriage and i didn't
<h> marry a woman why would they suddenly
<h> just pitch that brandon is now a woman
<h> but then you can think maybe the note
<h> behind the note is that this isn't
<a> feeling
<h> special enough maybe the note behind the
<h> note is that this feels like something
<h> they've seen before
<h> maybe the note behind the note is that
<a> um the person you've cast for the role
<h> the lead role to play you
<h> um feels like like is an actor that
<a> they've worked with before who has
<a> expressed that they
<a> want to be in a relationship with a
<a> woman on screen you never really know
<a> what the note behind the note is but our
<f> job as writers is to find it
<f> um and very often execs will pitch
<a> things that might
<a> at first blush sound kind of crazy but
<a> then there's a reason
<a> for it um so i think uh being able to
<a> realize that like their
<a> their job is not to tear you down um
there
<a> probably are some bad executives out
there who don't care but all the ones
i've worked it with their job is to
build you up
their job is to support your vision but
no one is going to understand your
vision as much as you do
