00:00
hi my name is amy aniovi and i'm a
00:02
writer producer
00:04
i'm currently a co-executive producer on
00:07
season three of insecure
00:09
and before that i worked on
00:13
a show called brothers in atlanta at hbo
00:15
and also silicon valley season two
00:18
and the michael j fox show and trial and
00:21
error on nbc
00:22
and awkward black girl
00:31
if if you feel like you're interested in
00:33
writing and maybe
00:34
are not quite like uh should i take a
00:36
class there are so many books about
00:38
writing
00:39
out there like i know for television
00:42
there's a book by ellen sandler called
00:43
the tv writers workbook
00:45
and it helps like break down how to
00:47
write a spec script a spectrum being
00:48
like your own version
00:50
of an existing tv show and that was like
00:52
essential to me
00:53
there's also pamela douglas has a book
00:56
called tv drama that breaks down how to
00:58
write a
00:58
television drama script in um four or
01:01
five or six acts
01:03
um and that was super helpful too um i
01:06
did a lot there are also like free
01:08
resources like even if you're like i
01:09
don't have five
01:10
dollars to cram together to buy a book i
01:12
just want to learn something literally
01:13
how do you write a screenplay
01:15
it's online and then i just started
01:17
reading all these
01:18
sources and realizing that i needed a
01:20
network like it wasn't enough to be
01:22
in like you know a closet reading stuff
01:26
online and watching tv alone having a
01:28
network of people around you
01:30
is so much more helpful um but it
01:32
doesn't mean that you have to have an
01:34
mfa like i always told my parents my
01:35
parents
01:36
like when i got by mfa they're like now
01:38
when you get a sign-on bonus and i was
01:40
like uh what that's not a thing
01:41
um it doesn't give you anything except
01:44
like
01:44
all it does is make sure that you'll
01:46
never be a doctor
01:48
this town like hollywood is filled with
01:50
way more people who
01:51
don't have writing degrees who are doing
01:54
great
01:55
uh it's not like a no it's not like a
01:58
prescribed thing like go get a degree
02:00
and then you become a writer that's not
02:01
a thing it's really just
02:02
right write write write write if getting
02:05
a degree helps you write more great
02:07
if being in a writer's group helps you
02:08
write more great if reading books online
02:11
or websites or watching youtube
02:12
tutorials helps you write more
02:14
great just right
02:18
sort of like a weird thing where it
02:21
happens when it's supposed to happen
02:23
and i find that if you're actually
02:25
looking for agents and looking for
02:26
managers
02:27
very often you end up with what's kind
02:29
of like a false positive
02:31
people who are looking for anyone find
02:34
you
02:35
because you're looking for anyone and
02:37
then sometimes it's not actually a match
02:39
to see that like if you're with people
02:40
who understand what you're doing and
02:42
want the same things as you
02:44
your peers your truest friends um
02:47
it is helpful because then you rise
02:48
together
02:50
the way i think of agents and managers
02:53
uh because i've talked a little bit
02:54
about like
02:55
which one what you need or what you have
02:58
i always think of it as
03:00
an agent closes the deal
03:03
for the job that you want or got and a
03:06
manager
03:07
guides you to the relationships that get
03:10
you the deal
03:12
a manager also manages your career and
03:15
an agent manages this contract um
03:18
i think you are responsible for your
03:20
work as they say like
03:21
an agent takes ten percent of your
03:23
salary so they do ten percent of the
03:24
work
03:25
um same thing for managers either take
03:27
ten or five you're responsible for the
03:28
writing
03:29
so anytime i've had a friend be like i
03:31
called my agent was like what were they
03:33
doing for me
03:33
i'm like you got to give them a contract
03:36
for them to do something for you
03:38
like you are responsible for your career
03:40
so it's kind of one of those things
03:42
where
03:42
you have to be doing the thing for
03:44
people to give you
03:46
the ability to do the thing and i think
03:48
representation
03:49
isn't something that you should be
03:50
running after honestly i think it should
03:52
be something that
03:53
is in the background you need to be
03:54
doing the work do the work do the work
03:56
do the work
03:57
and eventually the reps will be calling
03:58
you i think one of the biggest things to
04:00
look for is who else they represent
04:02
and do they represent people whose
04:03
careers you want i literally
04:05
like when i was on happy endings i was
04:07
in a room of 16 writers
04:09
the day before i started the job i
04:11
looked up all the credits
04:12
and i looked up who represented them and
04:14
it's literally as simple as like if you
04:16
have something like imdb
04:17
pro or studio system you can look it up
04:20
like for real
04:20
but i was like literally like jonathan
04:22
groff repped by into google
04:24
hey it comes up so you can do that with
04:27
anyone it's like rep by blah blah blah
04:28
if they've ever been written about
04:30
somewhere it says who the rep dot or you
04:31
know like agency
04:32
agent whatever um and i looked up
04:34
everyone
04:35
and all the people and also like movies
04:38
that were coming out and tv shows i
04:39
loved i would
04:40
watch the credits and write down the
04:42
names of the writers and i'd look up who
04:43
repped them
04:44
and i realized like all the funniest
04:46
people all the people whose careers i
04:48
wanted were wrapped at uta
04:50
and i was like oh i want to be at uta
04:55
there are a few rounds of staffing
04:57
meetings that happen
04:58
um the first round is called generals
05:01
and the second are called
05:02
staffing meetings uh generals are when
05:05
they're
05:05
they're like the water bottle tour you
05:07
go to different production companies and
05:09
studios and you just meet executives
05:11
usually junior executives to start out
05:13
or coordinators which are the people who
05:16
help
05:17
the upper level executives and they're
05:19
really just like meet and greets they're
05:21
kind of like first dates
05:23
and uh they're very casual uh
05:26
you should just like dress nice but
05:29
dress like you don't wear a suit
05:30
um because no one in hollywood wears
05:32
suits except agents
05:34
and uh and you always take the water
05:36
because you never know if your mouth is
05:38
going to get dry
05:39
when you go you are basically the number
05:41
one question you'll get in a general is
05:43
so tell me about you and your job is to
05:47
tell
05:48
your whole life story in like a minute
05:50
so we call that an
05:51
elevator pitch it's basically the name
05:54
is given from like if you had one ride
05:56
in an elevator from the bottom floor to
05:58
the top floor of a building
05:59
talk about yourself what would you say
06:01
uh so an example is i'm always like
06:03
well i'm from dallas texas uh i was
06:06
raised in a very nigerian home so didn't
06:08
own my first
06:08
pair of cowboy boots until i got to
06:10
college uh and i basically decided very
06:12
early that i wanted to disappoint my
06:13
nigerian
06:14
parents by not becoming a doctor instead
06:16
i became a comedy writer
06:18
that's sort of my elevator pitch and
06:20
then you can elucidate from there like
06:21
where you went to school
06:22
usually they'll prompt you with
06:24
questions but it really is just like
06:26
talking about you and saying a little
06:28
bit about yourself
06:29
other common questions are what type of
06:31
shows if if it's for tv
06:33
what type of shows do you like to watch
06:35
uh what is your favorite show on
06:36
television what type of shows do you
06:38
like to write
06:38
what kind of writer are you where are
06:40
you from where do you get inspiration
06:42
for your stories
06:43
are you single they don't ask that
06:46
after you've passed the generals round
06:48
basically once the lower level exacts
06:50
have agreed that you are worthy of
06:51
meeting
06:52
you kind of go up to the staffing round
06:55
which is with like development execs and
06:58
managers and
06:59
um sometimes even like vps
07:02
of comedy or drama based on your field
07:05
another important thing to remember is
07:07
if they do ask what type of writer you
07:08
are in television it's actually pretty
07:10
important to choose a side
07:11
comedy or drama um when you're starting
07:14
out
07:14
eventually you can write anything but
07:16
when you're starting they very much like
07:18
to put you in a box
07:19
so uh pick your side and you can do it
07:22
like i did just literally look at the
07:23
stuff you've written and the stuff you
07:24
watch
07:25
and say that's what you do and then
07:26
continue to write that
07:28
for the foreseeable future until uh
07:31
you've gotten some traction in that
07:32
field and then you can move over to the
07:33
other side
07:34
um so once you start meeting with those
07:37
execs
07:37
they'll be asking you which of our shows
07:40
do you like to watch which of our shows
07:42
are your favorites which of
07:43
our shows do you want to work on that
07:45
means not only what's currently on
07:46
television but also what's in
07:48
development at their network
07:49
which are like pilot scripts things that
07:52
other people have read
07:53
or written for them maybe like some
07:55
development projects
07:57
you can usually get those scripts by
07:58
googling or from getting them from like
08:01
your reps
08:02
um and then from there if you pass
08:05
that round of meetings then you get
08:07
producer meetings and show runner
08:09
meetings that's when you're meeting with
08:10
the show that you want to work on
08:12
so for instance you go in for a meeting
08:14
with the showrunner of happy endings
08:16
and he says what's your favorite episode
08:18
of this show and you probably should
08:20
have watched it and can talk about it at
08:21
length
08:21
but again it's just about being yourself
08:24
because really all of these meetings are
08:25
people deciding do i want to stay hang
08:27
out in a room with you for 10 hours a
08:29
day
08:30
because that's really the job do you
08:31
have a personality that makes me want to
08:33
be around you
08:34
or makes me not if you have a great
08:36
personality you're at an advantage
08:38
if you don't maybe work in features
08:42
as a writer in the room your individual
08:44
responsibility
08:45
is to uh be positive
08:48
to be on time and to always be listening
08:52
um and if you're listening well then you
08:54
get to a place where you feel
08:55
comfortable pitching
08:57
i think sometimes it's scary when you're
08:59
new to pitch i had someone say
09:01
if you do nothing else ask someone how
09:04
their day is going
09:05
and i literally when i was a staff
09:07
writer was terrified every day that i
09:09
was going to lose my job and i thought i
09:10
was alone there's this myth out there
09:12
that there's this perfect staff writer
09:14
who's killing it and is the funniest
09:15
person in the room and gets all their
09:16
pitches in
09:17
it's a myth that person doesn't exist so
09:19
get that out of your head
09:21
really everyone is nervous when they're
09:23
new and i would say
09:24
sometimes i'm like today my goal is to
09:26
talk to make one person laugh
09:29
today my goal is to make a joke about
09:32
lunch
09:32
today my goal and it was like these
09:35
little things
09:36
that were so like but i was just so
09:38
scared especially when you're at the
09:40
bottom and i was the only black person
09:41
in my first room
09:43
uh one of not very many women so it was
09:45
just like
09:48
hard
09:50
i think the first thing that i always do
09:52
is go to my writer's group first
09:54
i'll email my friends who i meet with
09:57
and talk writing with
09:58
and say hey so i had an idea for a show
10:00
what do you guys think about this
10:02
and because i like to get feedback from
10:03
writers first i think that writers like
10:06
think about things differently
10:07
than your reps do sometimes your reps
10:09
think about if it's sellable
10:11
um if it's marketable whereas your
10:13
writer friends will think about
10:14
is it right for you to write you know is
10:17
it matching your voice
10:18
is it something that they can see that
10:20
you're passionate about
10:21
and i think that's very good a barometer
10:23
for whether or not you should develop it
10:26
once i get kind of like the okay from my
10:27
writers group then i'll
10:29
send a log line to my agents and say hey
10:32
look i had this idea for a show
10:34
it's a drama about like two women
10:38
like firefighters whatever um
10:42
and they'll say well you know there's a
10:44
female firefighter pitch that's
10:45
happening is
10:46
spin-off of burn notice or whatever you
10:49
know
10:49
at fx so that already exists but what's
10:51
your take
10:52
and then you're like well here's my
10:54
version um and then
10:56
if they like it usually what they do is
10:58
say
10:59
hey this sounds really cool can you
11:01
write like a one sheet pitch
11:02
like and it's not a fully fleshed out
11:04
pitch it's just sort of like why you
11:06
care about this
11:07
who the main character would be what is
11:08
the show kind of like
11:10
um and usually you do that like in one
11:12
page
11:13
and then they'll use that to send to
11:15
production companies
11:16
um to uh maybe even like some
11:20
execs and see if people are interested
11:22
in it um
11:24
i find that like there you get to a
11:26
certain level i think we're sort
11:28
of like you can be the one who brings it
11:30
yourself to
11:31
the studio or to the network and say hey
11:34
guys i'd like to pitch you guys this
11:35
thing directly just from me
11:37
but i think sometimes there's some value
11:38
added and like getting to walk into the
11:40
room with somebody else
11:42
so getting to have like a production
11:44
company on your side is kind of cool
11:46
and so usually they'll send it to a
11:48
production company and then you meet
11:49
with them
11:50
you work out the pitch together and then
11:52
it becomes a fully fledged pitch
11:54
it goes from that one page version to
11:56
like more of like a
11:57
six seven eight maybe 10 15 page version
12:01
which is covering every aspect of what
12:03
the show would be
12:04
why you why now what the show is
12:08
is about what the log line is who the
12:10
main characters are what's the style of
12:11
the show what's the tone of the show
12:13
what are we going to be seeing week to
12:15
week what's the breakdown of what the
12:16
pilot is like literally what's going to
12:18
happen
12:19
um through the pilot what are the act
12:21
breaks what are the things that make it
12:22
sing what are the things that make it
12:24
different
12:25
and then wrapping up like why it means
12:27
something to you and why
12:29
it matters um and that sort of thing is
12:32
usually like a 10 to 15 maybe sometimes
12:34
even a 20 minute pitch
12:36
which is like long it's a lot of talking
12:38
it's like more talking than i've done
12:39
today
12:40
but like if you get that done um
12:43
and it's good then you get to pitch a
12:46
show and maybe even sell
12:47
a show one of the
12:51
biggest the number one phrase that every
12:53
writer should learn
12:54
is let me take a look at that as opposed
12:57
to fighting in the moment the note as
12:59
opposed to pushing back on people who
13:01
are
13:01
really there to help you it's important
13:04
to just be able to say i need to step
13:06
back
13:06
i'm feeling sensitive they're talking
13:08
about my main character who is based on
13:09
me and this hurts
13:10
and so you can just say good point let
13:13
me take a look at that
13:14
and then you go get to go away and sit
13:17
with your feelings and figure it out for
13:18
yourself um it's also
13:20
important to realize that very often
13:22
especially when you're getting notes
13:23
from people who aren't writers
13:25
the note isn't the thing to listen to
13:27
there's something called the note behind
13:29
the note
13:30
which is basically they might pitch you
13:32
something that you're like what
13:34
but really there's a note behind the
13:36
note they're giving so for instance they
13:37
might say
13:38
hey you know you have like your main
13:41
character jenna falling in love with
13:43
brandon on page five
13:45
is there something to be said for like
13:47
maybe
13:48
brandon is a woman and you're like oh
13:51
well this is
13:52
based on my first marriage and i didn't
13:54
marry a woman why would they suddenly
13:56
just pitch that brandon is now a woman
13:58
but then you can think maybe the note
14:00
behind the note is that this isn't
14:01
feeling
14:02
special enough maybe the note behind the
14:04
note is that this feels like something
14:05
they've seen before
14:06
maybe the note behind the note is that
14:08
um the person you've cast for the role
14:11
the lead role to play you
14:13
um feels like like is an actor that
14:16
they've worked with before who has
14:17
expressed that they
14:18
want to be in a relationship with a
14:19
woman on screen you never really know
14:22
what the note behind the note is but our
14:23
job as writers is to find it
14:25
um and very often execs will pitch
14:27
things that might
14:28
at first blush sound kind of crazy but
14:31
then there's a reason
14:32
for it um so i think uh being able to
14:36
realize that like their
14:37
their job is not to tear you down um
14:40
there
14:40
probably are some bad executives out
14:42
there who don't care but all the ones
14:43
i've worked it with their job is to
14:45
build you up
14:46
their job is to support your vision but
14:48
no one is going to understand your
14:50
vision as much as you do
14:59
you
