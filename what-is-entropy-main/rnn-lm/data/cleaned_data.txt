<43>
one thing that I
<40>
recommend
<70>
every after do before every single live audition that will help boost
<67>
their confidence and reduce
<70>
their nerves let's talk about it what's my pillow mattress welcome to acting career center to help you learn the skills you need to break into the film and television industry my name is heard you thank you so much for spending some here with me today if this is your first time here make that hit that subscribe button to get more videos on acting auditioning and career advice every single

week today
<70>
we're talkin about what I recommend every actor do before every live
<69>
audition I
<70>
totally
<78>
understand that
<69>
at the making of this video
<70>
we are still in a global
<43>
pandemic
<70>
and most if not all auditions are currently self tape and there no live auditions right now however I do expect that to slowly change and live auditions to slowly come back especially live
<43>
call
<70>
backs that being said we are getting
<69>
live callbacks on Zoom
<66>
meeting
<69>
were
<42>
talking
<52>
to someone live
<43>
but we're
<70>
not in the room with them live
<67>
right
<43>
and
<70>
what we're going to be talking about today still apply nice to the zoom
<67>
call
<70>
backs as well do what is it that every actor be doing before their live
<69>
auditions it's not just to prepare for the audition
<42>
that's
<69>
obvious we
<70>
have
<69>
to prepare for the audition
<42>
and
<69>
prepare for the
<39>
scene
<69>
of research that
<67>
role
<39>
in
<69>
research a character all of that
<42>
stuff needs
<69>
to happen this
<70>
is something extra out if you're interested in learning how to
<69>
prepare for the role
<70>
all of that other stuff then I've actually created a 10-step audition preparation guide that I call my audition cheat sheet if you want
<43>
to download at free
<70>
cheat sheet you can get it by going that link right
<43>
up there it's my own
<70>
audition
<69>
preparation
<70>
process that I have used to help me book over 50 movies and television shows
<67>
if
<70>
want to download it go to that link right up there
<69>
but today what we're talkin about is
<39>
everything
<69>
after
<39>
you
<60>
prepared for the role
<42>
you rehearse
<60>
your learned
<39>
the lines
<69>
you've learned the scene
<39>
and
<40>
all
<70>
of stuff now would we
<67>
have
<70>
to do well this last
<43>
step that
<79>
you should do
<70>
before going in for live
<69>
audition will
<70>
help boost your confidence and reduce
<43>
your
<40>
nerves let's
<70>
talk about a little bit about why we get nervous at an audition as after is the reason
<67>
we get
<69>
nervous it's not necessarily
<70>
the lines we do worry about
<69>
forgetting lines right
<70>
but it isn't the lines that makes makes us nervous what
<52>
makes us nervous is the
<70>
situation that we have to perform our life that
<43>
What Makes Us
<70>
nervous is walking
<52>
into that audition room and seeing that casting
<43>
and see my
<39>
camera recording
<70>
us and then
<69>
having to perform
<70>
in
<69>
front
<70>
of them there's a lot of pressure there that's
<43>
what
<69>
makes us nervous
<70>
because
<69>
think about it when
<70>
you've rehearsed your auditions
<43>
in the past
<42>
and I I've
<67>
done
<40>
this
<70>
and you
<43>
practice them and maybe you've done them 10
<70>
times in a you
<43>
did the
<70>
lights
<43>
10
<70>
times in row
<43>
or
<40>
20
<43>
times
<70>
a row and got it
<43>
right
<40>
every single time
<39>
and
<69>
you did while you
<70>
know in your living
<43>
room
<52>
at home and
<70>
then you drive to
<43>
audition
<79>
and
<52>
while you're the
<79>
car you
<70>
run through your lines
<79>
again
<52>
ten
<70>
times
<43>
20
<79>
times 30 times
<70>
in a you did it perfectly
<43>
every
<70>
single time and
<43>
then while you're sitting
<40>
in the waiting room for the audition maybe you run
<43>
through the lines
<70>
in your head 10
<40>
20
<70>
30 times
<43>
again
<70>
you're doing
<43>
perfectly
<40>
but then go casting directors there
<67>
that
<40>
cameras on
<69>
you they call Action
<66>
you're
<70>
under pressure all of a sudden
<43>
you get nervous
<70>
and now you start
<40>
forgetting those lines
<43>
what
<70>
you have to
<69>
do now is to not just
<40>
practice
<70>
lines but practice the situation what I mean by that I mean
<48>
practice this
<78>
scenario of
<69>
the
<70>
audition to put
<43>
yourself
<70>
in a mock
<69>
audition and practice
<70>
the pressure of
<52>
auditioning
<70>
so that when you do go into a live audition you
<69>
don't feel as as
<70>
you
<69>
feel more
<70>
confident this is very similar to professional sports where someone who has played
<43>
basketball their entire lives and
<70>
knows
<43>
how
<70>
shoot free throws and it's really good at
<67>
shooting
<70>
free they may not be able to perform well in a pressure
<40>
situation at
<48>
the end the game with
<70>
fans
<40>
screaming
<70>
at them are they going to be to
<67>
shoot
<66>
their
<69>
free throws as well as if they were shooting
<70>
by themselves in
<40>
the
<43>
gym probably not because it's a different situation
<70>
there under pressure right and sports teams will do
<43>
mock
<70>
pressure situations to help their athletes
<48>
prepare blasts
<43>
loud
<70>
music while people are shooting her free throws
<69>
or things like that right
<70>
so this is something we can
<43>
do is
<79>
actors as well
<70>
as the practice the situation
<43>
now
<70>
I think I
<43>
talked about
<70>
this
<43>
in another
<70>
video possibly
<40>
multiple
<43>
other
<70>
videos
<43>
but
<70>
I do
<69>
think this is such an
<78>
important topic
<69>
that it does deserve
<42>
its
<70>
own
<43>
video
<52>
so how can
<70>
we practice
<43>
these
<70>
pressure situations where one thing that you can do is to record yourself record yourself performing the
<69>
audition because when we practice just
<70>
sitting on the couch
<52>
or
<70>
practice well drive to the audition in our car there's pressure there because we're not being
<43>
recorded when you
<39>
set up a camera and
<70>
record yourself all send that changes something in you because you know
<43>
that you
<70>
have to perform because
<40>
something
<70>
is recording you this helps
<43>
this helps over the nerves of having that camera
<70>
in the
<43>
room because one
<70>
of the
<43>
things that makes us
<70>
nervous is when we walk that
<43>
audition room
<40>
we see that camera pointing
<43>
to
<70>
her face
<66>
that
<39>
makes us nervous but
<66>
if
<67>
you
<43>
get used
<40>
to
<39>
recording
<67>
yourself and get used
<43>
to that
<70>
camera on
<43>
you
<40>
all
<67>
the time
<40>
then
<43>
when you walk
<40>
into an
<43>
audition
<70>
and you have that camera on you it's going to
<69>
make you as
<42>
nervous
<43>
going
<70>
to feel more confident right now.
<69>
don't have to have
<70>
fancy
<43>
camera to do this most of us have a phone that can
<70>
record so record
<40>
yourself
<52>
with a phone set your phone
<40>
onto a tripod
<43>
adapters that
<70>
can just hold your phone if you don't have it if you don't have a tripod my recommendation is to buy one it's one
<40>
of best
<67>
purchases that
<70>
you
<67>
can make for your
<69>
acting career you'll
<70>
get so much
<43>
use
<70>
out of your tripod for self taping auditions
<43>
a
<70>
special but this is another
<67>
way to
<70>
use a tripod
<69>
is
<70>
to use it
<67>
to
<66>
hold
<70>
mock auditions to help you practice
<67>
for your
<70>
live auditions
<69>
now there's two big
<42>
benefits to
<43>
record
<70>
yourself
<43>
we've
<40>
already talked
<70>
about one of them which is you're getting used
<43>
to that
<52>
camera
<70>
recording you so
<40>
that when
<51>
walk
<78>
into an
<42>
audition
<69>
you're
<70>
totally used to having that camera there
<69>
the other
<70>
big benefit of recording
<43>
yourself
<70>
is that you
<43>
can
<70>
watch it back and evaluate and see how you did
<69>
some people will
<70>
say well can do that while practicing in front
<43>
of
<70>
mirror I discourage people from using a mirror practice their auditions
<40>
because you're never
<70>
focused 100% your performance when you practice
<43>
in
<40>
front
<70>
of mirror when you
<66>
press in front the
<67>
mirror you're
<69>
about
<39>
50% focused on your performance and
<40>
50% focused on evaluating it when
<39>
you
<40>
record yourself
<70>
you can devote a hundred percent
<43>
of
<70>
your
<43>
focused on your performance and then stop the recording and then walk around and watch it
<70>
back and then you can devote
<40>
100%
<43>
of
<70>
your attention on evaluating it right so this is why I recommend recording
<43>
yourself
<70>
instead
<43>
of getting in front
<70>
of
<67>
a
<40>
mirror the other
<70>
thing that you'll notice is if you record and watch it back you
<43>
may see things
<70>
that you would not have picked up on
<67>
had
<40>
you not
<43>
recorded yourself using
<70>
myself as an example
<67>
when
<40>
first got started and
<70>
I was recording
<69>
myself practicing an
<70>
audition I noticed
<69>
that I was kind of swaying
<70>
back and forth and
<69>
this was an
<70>
unconscious thing of
<43>
subconscious thing that I was
<70>
doing and I knew
<43>
I
<70>
had to correct that had I not recorded myself and had I just gone to
<43>
my audition
<40>
I probably would have that unconsciously
<70>
at the audition and
<52>
I would not have
<43>
known
<48>
I would just walked
<78>
room
<69>
and
<43>
thought
<52>
I
<43>
did
<70>
a great job right for them a
<43>
casting
<70>
director will watch that back and sit and why was he
<43>
swing back and forth the
<70>
whole time so that's a huge benefit of recording yourself have an S thing that you can do to practice an audition
<69>
scenario
<48>
is
<51>
to
<78>
basically
<70>
role-play
<43>
that scenario
<70>
get
<43>
someone
<70>
to help
<43>
you with
<70>
this get
<43>
a
<70>
family member or friend or
<40>
a fellow actor that
<43>
you
<40>
know
<43>
to
<67>
help
<70>
you basically
<43>
roll play the audition have
<40>
them play
<39>
the role the
<69>
casting director and you're going to
<43>
basically play
<70>
play yourself as
<43>
you
<52>
walk into an
<79>
audition they're
<52>
going to be
<43>
operating
<52>
the
<43>
camera and recording you
<70>
saying
<40>
the lines as your reader
<70>
right and
<42>
this
<69>
again
<39>
will
<70>
help you get used to that situation
<43>
of
<52>
walking
<51>
into that audition
<78>
room saying
<39>
hi
<40>
to somebody standing
<70>
on
<43>
your mark getting
<70>
ready to
<40>
record seeing them push
<70>
the bored
<40>
button
<43>
and then performing in front
<70>
of someone while
<39>
the
<69>
camera is rolling with that pressure
<70>
on you to perform in that situation
<69>
this is going be
<70>
so
<69>
different than practicing the
<70>
lines while
<40>
sitting on
<43>
your couch
<70>
right so this is another
<39>
thing that you
<69>
can do to help you
<70>
practice
<52>
the
<70>
pressure situation of being
<69>
in an audition
<70>
room if you
<43>
do
<52>
these
<79>
things
<70>
before going into your live on ditions I guarantee you're going to feel more confident
<69>
you're going
<43>
feel less
<70>
nervous now I'm not saying your
<79>
nerves
<70>
are
<43>
going to completely
<70>
gone but they're definitely going to be
<40>
lower
<70>
than
<66>
had you
<67>
not
<70>
done this now I mentioned that you can also apply this to your Zoom auditions and resume call back how do doing exactly the same thing you have a friend or family member
<40>
or
<51>
another
<78>
after
<69>
help you role-play and practiced
<70>
a mock resume audition or a monsoon
<43>
call
<70>
back before you have to sign on and do the real
<69>
thing
<42>
this
<69>
will help you is situation right practice
<70>
the situation not just the lines so that when do go into a live
<40>
Zoom
<69>
audition you
<70>
feel like you've done this before you feel more confident and
<69>
you feel less nervous all right I hope that helps you guys

I think is you start to meet more and
<70>
meet more actors in
<69>
the industry you'll learn that everybody has their own unique story about
<70>
how
<69>
they got started and
<70>
I'm no different I think my
<69>
story is pre unique
<70>
and
<69>
Ice didn't start the way lot of people did because I'm not one of those people that watch the movie or a play when
<42>
I was 5
<51>
years and was
<70>
mesmerised and wanted to
<69>
be an actor ever since I actually didn't do any acting when I was kid didn't any acting high school or in
<66>
college
<70>
I
<69>
actually went to college for computer science and engineering that was my major and that was my
<42>
degree in after I
<69>
graduated
<70>
I was working in the corporate world as a
<69>
software
<42>
developer I
<51>
actually worked
<70>
as software developer
<69>
for many years so I had a whole
<70>
nother life before I started
<69>
my acting career the way
<70>
I got into
<43>
acting
<69>
was actually because I was working in
<42>
the corporate world
<69>
I had job in this was in Cleveland Ohio so I grew up in Cleveland I went to Michigan for
<70>
college
<42>
and then I came back
<69>
to Cleveland for before my first
<129>
and he was actually photo of me my cubicle trying cool as
<69>
a software developer this was back I think I'll round maybe two thousand eight or something like which
<70>
is roughly when
<69>
I started
<70>
taking
<69>
acting classes
<70>
the way I got
<69>
into it was that me and my
<42>
best
<69>
from high school who is also working
<70>
a Corporate
<69>
Drive In Cleveland we would often
<70>
meet
<69>
up after work just looking for something fun to do after work with sometimes we can go to a
<70>
bar restaurant
<69>
for happy hour I remember we had even
<70>
attended a few Toastmasters meetings if you know what Toastmasters is
<69>
I also signed up for jiu jitsu classes for a. Of time back then and
<42>
at one
<69>
point we
<70>
having
<67>
to
<70>
walk by this acting studio in Cleveland Ohio and this was in April of
<69>
two
<72>
by Jessica was
<69>
teacher there the
<70>
head teacher there and
<69>
she also still owns and teaches at that school if
<70>
you are in Cleveland or
<60>
near Cleveland Ohio I highly recommend you check out her acting classes at the
<42>
hood School of acting
<69>
houde school
<70>
of
<69>
acting in
<70>
Cleveland Ohio for the link to them down in the description below I've actually interviewed
<69>
Jessica Hood Morris here on this YouTube channel about the
<70>
Meisner technique
<69>
which is an acting technique
<42>
that they teach at
<69>
that school
<70>
if you
<69>
want
<70>
to
<69>
watch that
<70>
interview all
<69>
put that down in the description below as well but anyways so me and my friend we happen find this acting school and we went to a free class to audit and looks fun
<70>
so we signed
<42>
for classes and
<69>
I remember when I signed up I had zero expectations in terms of
<42>
making
<69>
a
<42>
career
<69>
change in fact
<42>
there not a single
<51>
brain cell in my
<78>
head
<69>
was thinking that
<70>
I would pursue
<69>
acting as a career I signed up for those classes
<70>
strictly because it look like it would be something fun to do and when I signed up I was thinking well it was month-to-month type of class and I thinking that I could take
<69>
classes for a month
<66>
see
<69>
how I liked it if
<70>
I didn't like
<43>
I
<70>
would just stop
<69>
taking
<51>
classes the
<78>
next month
<51>
if
<42>
it
<69>
then
<70>
I would just
<69>
sign up for another
<70>
month and then another month and and just see how it goes well when I signed up in 2008 I actually
<69>
kept taking
<70>
classes there for
<69>
the next eight years so that's how much I enjoyed those classes in for that first year or it was again strictly doing it for fun
<70>
I
<69>
had
<51>
no
<69>
expectation of trying
<70>
get
<69>
an agent or make money or any of those things but the cool thing was is that that acting
<70>
class whether I knew
<69>
it or
<70>
at the
<69>
time I was gaining so much experience and so much knowledge while I was in there because it was that acting class that I made connections
<40>
was able to
<67>
get me
<70>
my
<42>
first
<69>
role in short film and
<40>
my first rolls in student filmed it was through that acting class that I got my first role in play
<70>
professional headshot and it was through
<69>
that
<70>
acting class
<69>
that I ended up getting my first agent the way I
<60>
got
<69>
that agent was because one of the
<70>
students in the class was
<69>
represented by an agent and she introduced me to her agent and that's how I got my first representation
<42>
that's also
<69>
what I tell people is the best way get an
<70>
agent is
<69>
through a
<70>
referral because that carries so more weight
<69>
than if you were to submit to an agent directly on your
<70>
own
<69>
that acting class gave
<42>
me so
<69>
many opportunities before I even
<70>
imagined getting the agent
<43>
or making any money
<70>
and part of reason why I never had the
<69>
idea of
<70>
potentially pursuing it a career was because I was
<69>
very naive
<39>
to industry before I
<69>
started taking
<70>
the classes
<69>
I thought
<42>
and
<39>
I
<40>
don't
<69>
I'm only one that thought this way I
<70>
think plenty of other people do
<69>
it specially people that don't really know about the acting industry at all but I just
<60>
assumed
<69>
that
<39>
that was made on
<40>
TV
<70>
was made in Hollywood I
<67>
assumed everything that we saw on our
<66>
TV screen any small
<69>
commercial or anything like
<42>
that I
<69>
assumed was made in Hollywood
<70>
I never even
<69>
considered that
<51>
local
<69>
commercials
<39>
for a
<69>
local company like
<39>
local car
<69>
dealership might be made locally I never consider that even though makes perfect sense that that would happen
<70>
but it took
<43>
me
<70>
being in
<43>
class to
<70>
learn these things
<42>
the way
<69>
I Learned was
<42>
that I
<69>
saw other
<42>
people
<69>
in class other
<42>
students in a class who had
<43>
agents
<42>
who
<69>
were auditioning
<42>
for these types things
<69>
and
<70>
would see
<69>
them on TV and that
<60>
was
<69>
amazing to me so that's how I learned about those things that local
<70>
commercials would be made locally and they would hire
<69>
local
<42>
actors
<69>
so when first
<72>
agent things
<48>
I
<69>
started on dishes in 4 to begin with because Cleveland Ohio is a very small market in terms of film television production
<70>
there
<69>
are zero TV show is being made
<70>
there at least when
<69>
I was there and there are maybe there might be one or two movies that come into town per year so when
<70>
I was there
<69>
99% of the auditions that actors
<70>
would get through
<69>
their agents
<70>
would for local
<69>
commercials or
<70>
for industrial videos
<69>
and
<70>
what
<69>
industrial videos are our videos
<70>
that are used companies for internal
<69>
use a
<70>
great example
<69>
of
<39>
an
<69>
industrial video is a
<42>
training
<69>
video so if you've ever had
<39>
a
<40>
job at
<70>
company and you watch the training video
<43>
on how do your job
<69>
those actors in those training
<70>
videos or acting in
<69>
industrial videos and I've done a ton of those when
<70>
I was
<69>
in Cleveland so that's
<70>
how I
<69>
got started that was my first agent and those were first types of things I started auditioning for when
<70>
I was when I got my
<69>
first agent in 2009 so this was about an a year after I started taking acting I was still working my
<60>
full-time job and
<69>
in fact I didn't quit my full-time job for a long time from 2009 through 2014 so those
<70>
four and
<69>
a half or so and 2013 beginning of 2014 for those four a half years I had an agent but I'm still working my full-time job as a software developer
<42>
and what I would do is if I got an
<69>
audition I would go
<70>
on my
<69>
lunch
<70>
break to do that audition
<69>
and then I will come back to work and then if I
<42>
ever
<51>
booked then I would actually
<42>
just take a day
<69>
off of work
<70>
and then do whatever
<69>
acting
<42>
job that
<69>
I booked
<70>
a weather at the commercial or
<69>
video or something like that and then
<66>
I
<69>
would come back to work the next day and I
<70>
did
<69>
that for
<70>
many years
<69>
I was working my full-time
<70>
job and then every once awhile I would have an audition and then everyone small I would book something
<69>
and it wasn't until 2014 that I decided that
<70>
maybe I want to try to do a little bit more
<69>
with acting so here's what happened at the end of 2013
<70>
I was just finishing up a 12-month contract
<69>
for my software job
<70>
and
<69>
come January of 2014 I had decision to make I could either take a
<70>
new contract for my software job or I can take a break and I elected to take a break at the time but my thought process was that I'm going to take 6 months off from my software job and try focus a little bit more on acting to see where that takes me and I
<69>
thought that I
<42>
can
<69>
do this because I
<70>
had saved
<69>
up some money and I felt I was in a financial and
<42>
where I
<69>
could take that risk and devote more time to my acting and
<42>
the reason
<69>
why I say is because
<42>
when I
<51>
was working full-time
<69>
there were certain auditions that my agent was sent me that I would have to turn down because I was working
<42>
on
<51>
a high-priority project work that I
<42>
couldn't
<69>
leave
<42>
for I
<51>
couldn't take our
<42>
lunch break to go to that audition
<51>
and I definitely
<42>
couldn't take a
<69>
day off a full day off from
<70>
work
<69>
to go work an
<70>
acting
<69>
job when had this high-priority project at work
<70>
so there
<66>
were certain
<69>
times when I had to turn down auditions
<70>
and turn down bookings and
<69>
this gave me an opportunity in the beginning of
<70>
2014 to push my software job aside for six months to
<69>
see what I could
<70>
do if I focused
<69>
100%
<52>
on
<79>
my
<52>
acting
<69>
career my
<42>
thought
<69>
was
<70>
that I was going to
<69>
take it 6 months at a and if things started going downhill
<70>
and
<69>
I can always fall back on my software career and
<70>
go back to that
<69>
job well that was 20 14 now its 2020 and in the past six years
<70>
I have not taken another software job since then so I've been really lucky and really blessed to have been to been able
<69>
to fully focus on my acting career this entire time sure I've had side hustles and side gigs
<70>
to bring
<69>
in extra
<70>
income but besides that I've been
<69>
able to support myself primarily with
<70>
my acting career now
<69>
that's how I was able to
<70>
start my career in Cleveland Ohio but as many of you
<69>
I
<70>
currently live in Atlanta Georgia so
<69>
how did I end up here
<61>
well
<69>
back in 2015
<70>
so about a year after I took my
<69>
break from software
<70>
and started focusing a hundred percent on acting in 2015 I met two people from Atlanta to actors from Atlanta
<69>
are their names were Alan O'Reilly and Jenna kanell and
<70>
meeting them really open open my eyes to Atlanta
<69>
as a
<42>
potential
<69>
opportunity destination because remember
<39>
I
<60>
before
<69>
that I was very naive to the industry and I
<70>
didn't know that
<69>
you know local things were made in Cleveland Ohio well
<70>
even
<69>
after taking acting from 2008 to 2015 I was still very naive to the acting industry outside of my local market so I understood how things
<39>
worked in Cleveland and in
<69>
kind the surrounding
<70>
areas but
<69>
still don't really understand how the whole industry work outside of our Market
<60>
I
<69>
still thought that movies
<42>
and
<69>
TV shows were all made in Hollywood right
<70>
and
<69>
it
<70>
took meeting
<69>
Alan and Jenna
<70>
to tell me
<69>
that know there are
<70>
other cities
<69>
out there that have a lot of film and television
<70>
production and since they
<69>
were from Atlanta
<70>
they really opened my eyes to what was going on
<69>
in Atlanta
<70>
so when they told me about that I started researching it and that was when really
<69>
started
<70>
considering
<69>
moving down to Atlanta and
<43>
it didn't take long
<70>
after
<69>
that
<70>
only a
<69>
few months
<70>
later in 2016 was when
<69>
I
<70>
decided to make
<69>
the and come down here to Atlanta the reason I made the move was because when was in Cleveland Ohio yeah I
<70>
wanted to
<69>
audition
<39>
for
<69>
movies and television
<39>
shows
<69>
I wanted to work on movies
<42>
and
<69>
those opportunities just didn't exist are the video that I just made last week was about what's the city to pursue an acting career and where you live does matter because certain
<70>
cities have more film and
<69>
television production
<60>
than
<69>
others and Atlanta happens to be one those cities and Cleveland doesn't happen to one of those cities so when was in Cleveland I
<60>
wanted to audition
<69>
for
<70>
movies and
<69>
shows but there was just not that opportunity I might get one audition for
<60>
a per
<69>
year if that sometimes zero
<70>
auditions for movies
<69>
and death
<70>
no auditions for TV shows
<78>
the entire time that I was there
<69>
once I move to Atlanta a
<42>
much
<43>
bigger production
<70>
Market
<69>
a
<70>
lot of movies
<69>
and shows are made here I started getting auditions for movies
<66>
and shows
<69>
every week often multiple times a
<51>
week two
<69>
instead
<42>
of
<69>
one audition
<70>
for a
<69>
per
<70>
year it
<69>
was
<70>
an audition every
<69>
week for a movie so it
<70>
was very but it
<69>
was such a drastic change from what I was used to this move
<42>
to
<69>
Atlanta
<70>
was that
<69>
next step that my career needed if you look at my IMDb profile
<60>
you'll see that all
<69>
of the movies and
<43>
television
<42>
shows that I've
<69>
worked on they've all been from 2016 onwards everything before that most of it was
<70>
just short films and
<69>
projects that worked on with my friends
<42>
so
<70>
this move to
<69>
Atlanta was a huge change
<66>
from
<69>
my career and one thing that want to mention is that this
<70>
entire
<69>
time since 2008 I
<70>
never stopped taking acting classes from
<42>
that
<69>
first
<42>
day forward
<69>
I always continue to take classes
<42>
I didn't stop
<51>
my agent
<39>
I
<69>
didn't stop when I booked my first job
<78>
I didn't stop when I got my first movie
<69>
or my first
<70>
television show I continue
<69>
to take acting all the
<70>
way through it but that's because
<69>
I
<70>
really believe in
<69>
I really
<70>
believe that actors need to
<69>
continue their training throughout their careers because there's always something
<70>
new learn there's always something
<69>
to improve and I feel like
<51>
that is a
<42>
huge
<69>
reason for the successes
<42>
that
<51>
I still take
<69>
acting classes is that I know
<70>
that I still
<43>
have
<52>
so room to grow
<70>
in my
<69>
career I'm nowhere near what I think my potential can be for example I just had my first lead
<43>
role
<52>
in a
<42>
feature
<70>
film that came out this month
<69>
so I have
<70>
so much more
<69>
to look forward to in my career and that's why I continue to train when move to Atlanta the
<70>
first
<69>
thing that I did was
<70>
I signed
<69>
up for more acting classes
<66>
in Atlanta so I really do believe in that when
<69>
I start to
<39>
look
<69>
back on
<70>
my career
<67>
as
<66>
a software developer
<69>
when I was sitting in a cubicle and staring at computer screen it feels like an entire
<70>
lifetime
<69>
ago now I would not trade this for
<42>
the world
<51>
I've had so many great
<70>
experiences up
<43>
until
<70>
now and I look forward to what the future has
<69>
to offer and I know so many of you that are watching this that follow my YouTube channel
<70>

<39>
careers
<69>
and that is the whole goal of this
<70>
acting career center YouTube
<43>
channel
<51>

<70>
helped you get
<69>
to where I am
<78>
and hopefully
<70>
well beyond where I
<43>
am
<61>
in
<70>
my
<69>
career
<70>
so
<69>
that is it for this
<42>
video if you
<69>
liked it please give it a thumbs
<70>
up and if
<69>
you have questions for me remember to leave them down
<39>
in
<70>
the comments until next time keep
<69>
if you want to be cast in movie or television
<70>
show is really
<69>
important to
<70>
understand
<43>
exactly
<70>
how the casting process works
<69>
because the audition
<70>
is
<69>
not the only step in
<70>
the process as
<69>
actors we really
<70>
only know about the audition
<69>
because
<39>
it's
<69>
the only step that we are
<70>
directly involved in right
<67>
but
<70>
there are steps before and
<69>
after audition
<70>
that are just
<69>
as significant and if you don't understand how you could be sabotaging your own chances of getting so
<70>
today let's talk about
<69>
exactly how the
<78>
entire
<69>
casting
<70>
process work what's on my fellow actors welcome to

<70>
and let me know down
<69>
in the comments
<70>
give me shout
<69>
out of the
<42>
refrigerator
<69>
how
<70>
the casting
<40>
process works
<48>
give you a
<78>
kind a high-level
<70>
overview of
<42>
the
<69>
casting process there are
<70>
specific
<69>
details
<70>
that different from
<69>
case
<70>
case from Project
<42>
to
<69>
but
<48>
I will give you a view
<69>
of how
<70>
in general
<69>
the casting
<70>
process works for movie
<69>
13
<42>
steps
<69>
that it takes to
<70>
cast a role in
<43>
movie or show and how
<70>
your audition kind fits into those steps let's
<39>
say
<40>
a
<70>
Disney movie movie
<40>
is
<70>
done
<69>
being written with
<70>
the writers of
<69>
finish
<42>
writing
<69>
the
<70>
script they now need to
<69>
cast
<42>
the movie
<69>
right so the
<52>
producers
<79>
now
<78>
need
<42>
hire
<69>
a casting director this is the
<70>
producers of the movie
<69>
to help the
<70>
casting director than take that script breakdown for those
<69>
roll a
<39>
breakdown
<69>
is just a short description of each roll inside the script
<42>
and
<48>
then
<69>
Step 2 is that the
<40>
casting
<70>
director will then send
<43>
those
<70>
breakdowns out to agent
<42>
sometimes those
<69>
breakdowns will be sent publicly posted
<70>
publicly as well
<69>
on sites like Afters access so that
<60>
individual
<69>
actors
<70>
and access most of the time for big budget movies and
<43>
television shows
<70>
they
<51>
go
<61>
directly to
<70>
ages and will not
<69>
be
<70>
posted publicly I would
<69>
say 95% of time
<42>
or more write
<69>
down to only go to agents and will not be posted publicly so that taxes can not access
<70>
them directly that's why it is so important that an after get an agent at some point in their career has
<40>
the breakdown
<39>
they will
<69>
then take them to their roster of all the actors
<42>
they
<51>
represent
<40>
in
<70>
C250
<69>
do it for
<70>
simplicity's sake in our example let's only focus on
<69>
one particular role because movie
<48>
script can have
<70>
50 or more
<42>
that needed cast
<78>
from
<70>
the lead all the way down
<69>
to all the supporting role let's just focus on one
<42>
person
<69>
that works in the coffee and the
<70>
description is 16 to
<69>
25
<40>
male
<70>
or female
<69>
so that's the
<70>
character
<42>
breakdown
<69>
breakdown I done look my roster of all the actors I represent repeat
<66>
that
<69>
break down okay and once I find that group of people all of those actors
<42>
that did
<69>
the
<70>
breakdown
<69>
by
<70>
then send
<69>
the headshot resume and demo reel of
<39>
all
<40>
of those actors in
<69>
a
<42>
casting director in a casting director here are all of the actors okay
<60>
so
<61>
we're not
<40>
involving the actors yet this
<70>
is communication between the casting director
<42>
any agent so far
<69>
is step three agent now sending all of the
<40>
actors they represent
<43>
back
<70>
to the casting director for a particular rule casting director has received all of those
<78>
headshots
<39>
resumes in demo
<48>
reel
<78>
they now look
<69>
at
<42>
all of these actors and
<69>
decide
<70>
which ones they would like to
<69>
see audition
<70>
now in
<69>
an
<78>
ideal world
<69>
every single after would get a chance to audition but
<70>
unfortunately in
<69>
the real
<70>
world there just isn't that much time available that's the
<69>
problem
<70>
have
<78>
enough time to audition
<69>
every single after that
<70>
wants to wash dishes because
<43>
think
<70>
about it we're only talking about one agent
<69>
here typically
<48>
a casting will
<51>
reach
<48>
out to dozens of Agents so in dozens of
<69>
Agents all
<42>
send
<69>
all of their actors that fit that particular coffee shop worker roll the casting director could potentially get the mission of hundreds or even thousands of actor headshots there's no way that the casting director can audition hundreds or thousands of people for that one role
<70>
because remember there are fifty other roles that need be
<69>
cast for this movie rights over this particular rule they might be able to see 20 or 30
<42>
answers
<51>
that means it's for each agency that they might only be
<42>
able to audition after or two actors
<69>
for each
<70>
agency this is why it
<43>
is
<70>
so important to have a
<39>
great
<69>
head shop because in this step the process how are you going to stand out casting director
<48>
the
<78>
is looking at a CD of hundreds
<51>
of
<42>
headshot
<69>
and they have to decide 20 or
<72>
30 out of all
<69>
of
<72>
those people that
<69>
they
<72>
want to see en
<69>
douchen so you have to
<72>
have a head shot
<69>
that really catches their eye really stands out for
<72>
decide I want
<69>
to
<70>
see this
<43>
person so
<39>
that is
<70>
Step 4 step
<42>
four
<69>
is the
<42>
casting
<69>
director selecting
<70>
which actor
<42>
they would like to see
<69>
audition and
<42>
then telling that
<52>
to
<70>
agent saying hey
<69>
thank
<70>
you for sending me all of these
<42>
actors
<69>
that fit this role here are the two actors I would like
<43>
to see audition please moving
<70>
on to
<69>
step five
<70>
step
<79>
five
<70>
is now the agent
<43>
now passing
<70>
that information to
<69>
the actor now finally the actor
<70>
comes
<43>
into play the
<42>
agent will
<60>
then tell the
<69>
answer
<42>
hey
<60>

<61>
got
<60>
an audition
<42>
and
<69>
here are the sides step 6 is the actor preparing for the audition
<78>
in this is the part
<69>
that we are all familiar with
<43>
as
<70>
after now we finally have the audition side we the role that
<42>
we need
<69>
audition for
<70>
and now we have time
<69>
to get
<70>
ready for the audition in my experience typically you have between 24 and 48 hours to prepare for
<69>
an audition
<70>
I will have
<69>
more
<70>
than an extra day very very rarely will I have more than four days to
<69>
prepare for an audition I
<70>
would say on average it's
<69>
about
<70>
48 hours now you might
<69>

<69>
you can get up and go to that
<70>
link right up there with prepared your
<42>
audition
<69>
step
<70>
7 is
<69>
actually
<70>
do the audition audition can be live and in person or what's a little bit more
<69>
common these days is doing a
<70>
cell tape which is reporting your
<43>
audition
<42>
at home
<70>
and then send to
<69>
the casting director Stephanie is the casting director reviewing every single audition from each of the actor
<42>
if they were in person
<51>
auditions
<78>
they
<51>
would
<78>
have
<51>
all been
<69>
recorded
<42>
in the room
<69>
for the casting director will wash all of those auditions back again or if they were self wash
<70>
all of those tapes at this
<42>
point
<69>
could
<70>
not
<69>
be call
<70>
Bast
<79>
depending on the
<70>
project
<43>
and
<69>
depending on the
<70>
roll
<69>
a call back
<70>
is
<78>
when
<42>
a
<70>
casting directors and bring back some of the actors that they really liked for
<43>
that
<52>
particular
<43>
role
<69>
to
<70>
give them a second round of auditions if an actor gets a call back that means are really interested in them for rule they
<69>
they've
<70>
been brought back not everybody
<69>
gets brought back call back they usually only bring back the people that they are
<42>
really
<69>
interested in now some auditions don't have all that sometimes they will just booked the actor off of the initial audition some will have one round callbacks some others will
<78>
have even
<51>
more
<42>
than
<69>
one producer sessions and
<70>
network test and all
<43>
kinds
<70>
stuff here is that there might be call back there might not be but just understand what they are in this process after the
<43>
callbacks
<69>
the casting director will then make their recommendations for each role of the
<70>
project the producers
<79>
so
<70>
that is Step 10 the casting director recommending their top or top
<43>
five
<70>
actors
<43>
for each
<70>
role to producers for a final casting decisions eleven the final casting decision now needs to be made it's important to understand
<43>
that the
<70>
casting director does not make the final casting decision they
<43>
may
<70>
have influenced but they are not
<42>
the
<69>
final maker for
<70>
a television show The Final Decision makers are the producers the
<69>
showrunner and the network Run movie It's
<79>
usually the
<70>
producers
<69>
and the director
<70>
the important thing is
<43>
that
<70>
it
<69>
is not
<42>
the casting director
<51>
the casting
<42>
director does have an important role in
<51>
the
<42>
beginning of the process because they select who they want to see audition so in a way they do
<69>
decide has a
<42>
chance
<70>
in the part but when it comes to the very end they don't make that final decision so that
<79>
was
<70>
step 11th step 12
<69>
is
<78>
once
<69>
a
<78>
final decision is
<42>
made the casting director then
<78>
extend an
<69>
offer
<78>
to
<69>
the
<42>
agent
<69>
of that after and then
<70>
Step 13 is
<69>
the final step of the agent
<42>
then
<69>
passes
<70>
along that offer
<43>
to
<69>
the Acura and said hey after you have
<42>

<69>

<42>
on
<69>
set one day and watch are you thinking about moving to a new city to pursue acting if so are you considering
<70>
Atlanta and
<69>
you're considering
<70>
Atlanta should
<69>
you be is up my fellow actors welcome to the acting career center here
<70>
to help you break into the film and television industry so you can create the acting career of your dreams my name is / you honored to be here with you today talkin
<78>
about the opportunities for
<69>
actors in
<70>
Atlanta but before we get started on that topic I got a few quick housekeeping notes to get to because I have not made a video in a long time so if you have been a subscriber to this channel for a while maybe
<69>
since
<70>
I started it back in 2014
<69>
first of
<70>
all
<69>
thank
<70>
you second of all I really apologize for
<69>
not
<70>
making a video in
<40>
a while but
<70>
one of the main reasons for my Hiatus is
<69>
Atlanta
<70>
my acting career has gotten really really busy after moved here to
<48>
Atlanta hence
<69>
the reason for this so
<70>
one you may have noticed is that the name of the channel has changed what used to small market
<69>
after is
<70>
now acting career center now part of the reason for the change is
<69>
actually Atlanta because
<70>
I no live in small Market I moved from Cleveland Ohio to Atlanta Georgia back in 2016 and
<69>
Atlanta just
<70>
happens to be one of the biggest film and television production cities in world right
<69>
now
<66>
which
<70>
we will talk about later so small Market actor and small Market actor.com or
<69>
no more and in their
<70>
place we now have acting career center and acting career
<69>
and I think this name this new name the channel is
<70>
Ashley a better reflection of what I am originally intended for it be anyway because what I really wanted to do with
<69>
this channel in beginning
<70>
was to
<69>
help educate
<70>
people to help to help people who were newer actors were new to the industry who
<69>
wanted to make this career but didn't know
<70>
how to and
<69>
I've been working after since 2009 and in
<70>
that time I've gained so much knowledge and so much experience that I
<69>
hope to
<70>
to share with you too hopefully you know lead you down the right
<69>
path limit your
<70>
mistakes so you can continue down this road of becoming a working professional after because like I know it can hard at times it can be and it can be frustrating at times if you if you're an actor who's been plugging along and feel like you've made no traction look I get
<69>
it so I'm doing this to hopefully inspire you to show
<70>
you that if someone like me can do it if this for software developer a guy who didn't study acting High School didn't study acting in college I didn't take my first acting
<69>
class
<78>
until
<69>
I was
<70>
26 old guys
<69>
if someone like me can do this
<70>
then you can absolutely do this too as long as you're willing to work hard you're willing to study and learn not just the craft
<43>
acting
<70>
but also the business of the industry and you're willing to be a professional in every sense of the word if you're willing do those three things then I've no doubt that you have got a shot and making this your career
<69>
and that's exactly
<70>
why I made this channel the acting career center to help you do just that if that sounds like
<43>
something
<70>
you want to learn more about then take subscribe to this channel if you haven't already and leave me comment down below if you have any burning questions leave me question down below that
<69>
I could possibly
<70>
answer for you in a future video okay
<69>
all
<78>
right enough
<39>
keeping
<70>
stuff let's talk about Atlanta so back in 2015 when I was still living in Ohio I really had no idea that the film and television industry even existed down here in Atlanta and
<69>
that it had already been here for years and was growing year after year and
<70>
the thing that really propelled Atlanta this is just like a tiny little history lesson the thing that really propelled Atlanta to becoming what it is today was back in 2008 tax credit was passed the state that gave production companies a huge financial incentive to bring their projects to Georgia and
<69>
after that happened there was it
<39>
didn't
<69>
happen overnight
<78>
but
<42>
year after
<69>
year the film industry grew and grew and grew to
<70>
the where now
<69>
in 2020 I
<70>
want get this number right film and TV has grown become a nine point five billion dollar industry
<69>
in state of Georgia in 2016 this is a crazy fact the year than I moved to Atlanta in 2016 there were more major feature films
<42>
made in Georgia
<70>
than California
<69>
what Mina
<70>
with me when first heard that California that's where Hollywood is and you're telling me more movies were made in Georgia than California is true in the movies made
<79>
Georgia aren't some obscure films that you've
<70>
never
<43>
heard
<70>
of day are some of the biggest Blockbusters in theaters year after year including the highest grossing movie of all time Avengers endgame shot in Georgia down in Pinewood Studios just south of Atlanta so
<69>
let me give you a made in
<42>
Georgia
<51>
in
<69>
the
<70>
past
<61>
decade
<60>
you
<70>
ready
<69>
for this
<42>
okay
<70>
Avengers Infinity War Avengers endgame black panther Ant-Man Ant-Man and the WASP
<61>
Spider-Man homecoming Venom Captain America Civil
<70>
War Guardians
<69>
of the
<70>
Galaxy Vol 2 hidden figures Sully passengers Godzilla king of monsters
<61>
Fast
<60>
Five Furious
<61>
7
<70>
the
<61>
fate
<70>
I
<69>
Tonya the accountant bad Moms Christmas Hunger Games Catching Fire Hunger Games Mockingjay tag doctor sleep baby driver Pitch Perfect 3 Zombie Land to
<70>
Richard
<69>
Jewell oh and many many
<72>
many
<69>
more oh
<70>
wait I didn't even mention a single television show all right here is some of the shows that were made in Georgia
<61>
in past decade
<69>
The Walking Dead stranger things the resident The Vampire Diaries The Originals Ozark Watchman Atlanta Dynasty Black Lightning insatiable Cobra Kai MacGyver Lodge 49 The Haunting Hill House Doom Patrol Halt and Catch Fire the gifted star
<78>
and
<70>
many many many more including all of Tyler Perry's movies and television shows
<43>
being
<70>
shot in his massive 330-acre Studio Lot right the heart of Atlanta yeah so
<78>
all of that
<69>
has
<78>
happened all of that and
<69>
has in Georgia in the past decade
<70>
basically since 2008 crazy crazy so okay now back to our original question for you should you as an after move to Atlanta for your acting
<43>
career well
<70>
ultimately that's a very personal question right is not the
<43>
question
<70>
that I can just say yes or no to because it's going to different for but what I can do is provide you with as much information as possible to hopefully lead
<69>
you to
<70>
make a better-informed decision that's right for your exact situation
<69>
okay factors
<70>
that I think you take into account when you're deciding whether or not you move to Atlanta
<61>
for acting first of all if
<70>
you're still worried about Atlanta being too small of a market compared
<69>
to
<70>
Los Angeles or York if you're still worried that you may not get enough opportunities in market
<43>
like even
<70>
though I just
<61>
gave you that giant list of movies and television
<70>
shows
<43>
that were being
<42>
made here
<69>
if that's your main concern let me put that to rest
<70>
right now
<69>
I
<70>
want to share with you my story might number of auditions that I've been getting for film and TV since I've been here at the time go all way back to 2011 so I'm going to you number of film and TV auditions that I have received year after year since 2011 which was back when I still lived in Ohio and then I'll bring it all the way to 2019 last year so
<69>
for the past three living in Atlanta all right you're ready in 2011
<70>
the number of film TV auditions I
<43>
got
<70>
one one total the whole year 2012 0 20130 2014 320 15 7 2016 all right 2016 is when I move to Atlanta got my first agent in Atlanta number of film and TV on Dish's I got in 2016 76 2017 105 2018 92 2019 110 wow I mean that's all I can that it's kind of mind-boggling that I went from getting just a
<69>
couple sometimes zero film
<70>
and
<69>
TV auditions in whole year to
<70>
getting over a hundred a year I mean in 2019 on 110 film and TV auditions in a year that's one every three days that's
<61>
crazy to me so when I
<70>
say that the amount of opportunity in Atlanta is huge
<43>
is
<52>
almost
<79>
mind-blowing I'm not exaggerating at all
<78>
so if you were an actor that's thinking about moving to Atlanta and your biggest hang-up is wondering if you're going to get enough opportunities I want to just just forget that
<79>
and also if there's anyone telling you that you have to move to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career they're just wrong the wrong
<78>
they don't know what
<42>
they're talkin about
<69>
look I'm not saying that Atlanta is the only place you can go I'm not saying that you can't go to a Los Angeles but just want you to know that there other options available and Atlanta just happens be one of the best options okay so then the
<70>
next question that
<48>
a
<51>
lot of
<78>
people have
<69>
when I say
<78>
all these
<69>
crazy
<78>
numbers and I'm
<40>
getting all these
<70>
great opportunities people will ask what does that mean Atlanta is better than Olay well that's an even tougher question answer because better is going to different for everybody situation again
<43>
what's
<70>
better
<43>
for
<52>
me may you
<40>
may not
<67>
be better for the next person so again you're going to have to figure
<70>
out exactly what you're looking for will your specific situation is and then whether Atlanta or LA or New York or any other Market has the best things offer you I will say this though I do think if you are an actor who is just starting out who is new to the industry and who who is just trying to get their first few credits I think Atlanta is better option than La I actually think Atlanta might be the best option in country for an actor like that may be the best option in the world
<69>
and I'll tell why there are
<70>
in my opinion fewer barriers to entry in Atlanta what I mean by that I mean that you will have more access to the things that newer actors are always trying to get which is get an agent which is start getting auditions and just start getting out there and trying to book rolls it is not uncommon for an actor in Atlanta who is brand new to the to be able to get an agent in their first year in first few months of being here and start auditioning immediately for big TV shows and big
<40>
movies
<70>
so I do think a newer after coming to Atlanta versus and you
<43>
were
<52>
after in
<79>
the same situation going
<43>
to
<70>
La I think that actor in Atlanta is going to have an easier time getting an agent is to have a little bit of an easier time getting auditions getting their first few auditions and is going to have a little bit of an easier time probably booking there for few jobs so the no there's a few reasons one is that there are there there are just fewer actors in Atlanta so a little bit less competition now that's not to say there is there aren't that many actors in Atlanta there are a ton of trees here and there are more moving here day by day but compared to La Atlanta's nowhere near saturated as a market like Los Angeles another factor is that like I mentioned before it's not uncommon for an agent and a pretty good agent in Atlanta to sign an actor who doesn't really have that much experience who to sign them right out the gate and start giving them auditions start giving them opportunities whereas in Los Angeles now. Lauder I've never lived in Los Angeles but I've had friends that live there and I've heard their stories and from what I hear that situation that I described for an actor in Atlanta that doesn't happen in La what's more common in La is that agents want to see legitimate film and television credits mostly television credit on your resume before they're willing sign you which puts new Rafters and kind of a catch-22 of well how do I get credits before I have an agent and then how do I get an agent before I have credits it kind of doesn't
<43>
make sense
<67>
so for those reasons it does it is a
<70>
little bit easier for a newer actor to kind break into the industry here in
<69>
Atlanta compared to
<70>
the some the bigger markets like in LA or York another factor that would make Atlanta a more
<69>
desirable place
<78>
and this goes
<69>
beyond you were
<70>
actors is that the cost of living in Atlanta is a lot
<69>
better
<70>
than the cost of living in Los you probably already heard the stories of how how expensive it is to live in
<43>
a
<70>
place
<61>
like Los
<70>
Angeles Los so
<61>
I just pulled up the numbers
<70>
of the median rent in La for a one-bedroom apartment is the median rent in La for one-bedroom apartment is now the median rent in Atlanta for a one-bedroom apartment is so that's like a $800 difference there that's not to say different neighborhoods are going
<67>
to have
<69>
are going
<70>
to be higher or lower in each City but this is just on average are going to be paying lot less for the same thing in Atlanta for your living situation then in Los
<43>
Angeles
<52>
also
<70>
if you're looking to buy a place the medium the median home price in Los Angeles is and the median home price in Atlanta is so that is just
<69>
more
<70>
affordable to live here all
<69>
these myself is
<78>
example
<51>
I can
<48>
afford to live in this place I've
<70>
been fortunate enough to buy my place here in Atlanta
<48>
and I
<78>
would not be able to afford a place like this in Los Angeles it would cost many
<70>
times more than
<69>
I paid
<70>
for here and I've actually heard many stories about actors in Los Angeles who blew through all of their Savings in less than a year and had to move back home because they just weren't ready for how much it actually cost to live there and is the people that are living there and haven't move back home it feels like they're spending all of their time working just trying to make enough money to pay rent and live in survive and they don't have money for acting classes and they don't have money for headshots and don't have money to actually pursue their career because it's so expensive
<48>
to
<78>
live
<69>
in that City
<70>
again I
<69>
haven't
<79>
lived there
<42>
so
<43>
I
<42>
can't do a
<51>
apples-to-apples
<78>
comparison but I
<48>
will say
<70>
I feel
<69>
very financially stable
<70>
where I am right now in Atlanta okay really her I said that it was easier for an actor in Atlanta to kind break into the industry compared to that same actor in Los Angeles and I want to make a distinction I want to make it very clear that I'm saying it's easier not easy it's certainly not easy to break into this industry no matter what
<69>
Market you're in so I don't want to make this
<70>
sound like a
<69>
l
<72>
a
<70>
bashing
<69>
session I'm certainly not saying that
<70>
there's anything wrong with LA
<69>
or there's anything bad with LA
<70>
there's just these differences and there are certain reasons why someone may want to go to La instead
<69>
of Atlanta to let's talk about a few of those first
<39>
of all and
<48>
this is
<39>
kind a woo Hollywood thing
<40>
but
<43>
Hollywood
<70>
does have this kind of Mystique about it Hollywood does have that I mean there's this though the Romantic idea of going to Hollywood to pursue your dreams is an after right it it's that if that dream that every kid has Growing Up So if you're in love with that
<52>
idea that that
<43>
story that that
<70>
story that lalala
<43>
presented
<70>
to in that movie if you're in love with that then there's probably there's probably nothing that I can say anyone
<69>
else can say to tell you to go to a different Market because Atlanta certainly is La it's it's different
<78>
it's got its
<69>
own great things about
<70>
it but it is in that City so if you're in love with that idea of pursuing your career in Hollywood and bio meets go do that because no other city is going be able to give that to you another thing the lifestyle the lifestyle in La
<69>
is just that's another
<70>
animal in itself and if that's something that you desire if you love that weather if you want the same 65 to 70 degree weather year round if you want get out there on the beach and surf if you want to
<43>
if you
<52>
want that
<79>
potential opportunity to
<52>
run
<79>
into
<78>
a Warner Brothers executive at coffee shop on a Saturday
<48>
morning
<70>
La you got to go to
<69>
La for that right now here some real legitimate things for for actors
<42>
career-wise
<69>
sitcoms if your if your thing is sitcoms and you think you're an after that will that will really thrive in a sitcom and you want
<42>
audition
<69>
for sitcoms you got to go to
<70>
La there are no sitcoms being shot in Atlanta right now none at least in 2020 there's not being shot here right now same thing with soap operas no soap operas in Atlanta if your thing is you want
<79>
be on a soap opera and you want to pursue that
<70>
above everything else and got to to La there's no question about it there's there there were soap operas in New York but I don't think there are any of their now either so you really just got to go La for that another thing I want say about a late is that from you
<69>
or actors I'm not saying and were after should
<70>
never go to La I think Atlanta is best option for a actor trying break into the industry right now but there's no reason to to think that you can't come to a Atlanta and start your career off here and if you start gaining some traction and start booking and start building credit on your resume and really start making getting a good demo reel together maybe
<69>
at
<66>
that point
<69>
maybe that point
<66>
is when you go
<69>
to LA because
<66>
now
<69>
you'll be more desirable to two agents into casting in place like Los Angeles
<70>
rather than the the hordes people that
<78>
move there every who
<69>
have
<78>
zero experience
<70>
so the last thing I'll is that
<69>
I've been in Atlanta since 2016 I
<70>
have no plans on moving to La anytime
<79>
soon
<70>
I have no plans on moving to New York or
<69>
anywhere else for that matter I
<70>
I really love it here I love my situation here I love my agent I love the auditions that I'm
<69>
getting I
<70>
am booking I'm getting to work on sets of some big huge movies and television shows every
<69>
year
<48>
and I
<78>
can afford
<69>
to own a
<51>
home I can also
<78>
afford to rent a office space for my photography
<70>
there's one more thing that about Atlanta I'd have always tell people I the community here just from the top down from the actors to the teachers to the agents to the casting directors to just everybody in the community here in Atlanta in this industry is so supportive of one another and wants to see each other succeed I just it warms my heart thinking about the actors here in Atlanta and how much they are cheering each other on it's great and again I've never lived in Los Angeles or New York or another big acting Market but just from accounts from friends of mine I don't hear them saying the same
<43>
thing in
<52>
those cities
<70>
and when I've met other actors that have moved here from the bigger markets that have moved Atlanta they the same thing that they see something different about the community here and how supportive of it is of one another so I love that about Atlanta and I think that is a huge plus if that's something that you value then really consider
<69>
Atlanta all right that's about
<70>
all I to say I know that it might have sounded a little biased because I live in Atlanta but I'm certainly not trying to convince any you want to move here but if you're in position where you're thinking about moving to another Market all I want to do is give
<78>
you information
<69>
and then you
<70>
do with it what you will because that's what happened
<52>
me
<43>
in
<69>
2015 when I was still living in Ohio I no idea that there was even film and
<42>
television industry down here until someone
<69>
told me about it and then I researched it and I ended
<70>
up here A year later and hey if you
<51>
do
<48>
moving to
<39>
Atlanta
<70>

<69>
just
<66>
want to then
<69>
you
<70>
can go and do that right now if however you want make acting career if you want to go anything further than doing
<43>
as a
<70>
hobby if you wrote down in comments you want do you want to work
<40>
on big movies
<70>
big television shows you went work on Netflix
<69>
or Disney or a be or anything like that if you want to win an Oscar right
<43>
anything
<69>
beyond it being a
<70>
hobby than you
<43>
do
<42>
have to
<70>
take some necessary
<69>
steps
<72>
the
<69>
first step
<70>
to starting an acting career is to take
<43>
acting
<52>
and there are plenty of
<70>
acting classes that you can take here's list
<69>
of some classes I would
<70>
recommend you can write these down if you want technique classes
<69>
scene
<52>
study classes
<70>
improv classes on camera pause his voice and movement accents and dialects
<69>
weapons and combat script analysis and
<70>
audition classes now that I would recommend any actors start with this is the very first step
<42>
that
<70>
every single
<69>
actor must take
<43>
and
<52>
it
<51>
cannot be skipped
<69>
you
<70>
cannot skip taking acting you can't
<69>
just get an agent to start auditioning for movies and television shows it doesn't
<70>
work that way and it's not because you're not talented it's because you got to
<69>
give
<70>
casting directors
<69>
and agents and
<70>
actors and of reason
<40>
trust
<69>
show them that you're serious about this as your career
<78>
I'll use an
<69>
example
<70>
here let's say you were playing a sport and you broke your and you needed surgery and I came and told you hey I'll
<43>
do the
<70>
surgery for you I never went to medical school I never learned to do a surgery but I'll do
<69>
for you I'm
<79>
confident that I'll
<70>
do
<79>
it
<67>
are you
<70>
to
<67>
trust
<70>
me to perform surgery on your arm with the dumbest thing I've heard or would you trust someone who went medical school that's the point here you got to give him a reason to put their trust in you to cast you in their project that is only one benefit of taking acting another huge
<69>
benefit of acting
<70>
classes is that it will build your network in this career the more people that you know the more people that know you the more chances that you will have to succeed and to move forward in his career because you're building a community when you go to acting classes
<69>
I
<52>
can't tell you that
<70>
a fellow student in an acting class emailed me and hey I saw this audition that you fit and they sent to me and they told
<79>
me
<43>
to
<69>
submit
<60>
to
<70>
it and I've done this for other people to I seen auditions that would fit
<69>
a friend
<70>
of mine and I would send it to them and tell them hey check this out you should audition for this project and it's not the students in the class is your teachers to I've
<69>
gotten so many opportunities for
<70>
my acting teacher has a bunch of my IMDb credits for movies came from projects that acting teachers were other students recommended that I audition for in that I eventually this is the real power of of a network and a network that you can build by going to acting class this is why I've continued to go to acting class for 12 years I've been taking acting like every single year at my entire career because I know how how much it benefits my career and it's not just the stuff that I learned in class improving my
<69>
technique
<78>
and
<51>
proving
<78>
my acting ability which is
<69>
extremely
<70>
important but it's
<69>
also the
<48>
network but
<78>
I'm building the
<69>
community classes The Next Step every actor needs to take especially
<70>
if they want start
<78>
auditioning for anything is to get a professional
<70>
headshot your headshot is your most important marketing tool as an actor it's the extremely important to make a first impression is another just
<69>
you're trying to
<70>
pursue acting professionally then you
<69>
have to get
<70>
a
<69>
professional
<70>
headshot if you
<43>
want
<52>
agents
<70>
and casting directors
<43>
to
<70>
take you seriously then you have to show them that you are taking your career seriously you
<51>
want
<78>
them to have
<70>
confidence in you and
<69>
you can't give them
<70>
a picture that was taken on your eye so how do find a good headshot photographer well ask the people in your acting class that's another great benefit
<43>
of
<70>
your acting classes that you have people to
<51>
rely
<69>
on to give you advice I can tell you who
<70>
are some headshot photographers where I live in
<69>
Atlanta but if you don't live where I am you're not
<42>
going to come all way here
<69>
to take
<70>
head shot so
<43>
you
<42>
were going
<69>
to
<70>
want
<69>
ask
<78>
the people that in your
<69>
city
<70>
who you can go to to get a great
<69>
headshot
<70>
to a great place to ask is
<69>
in
<70>
your
<79>
acting class so those were
<52>
the first
<70>
two steps to starting an acting career before you
<69>
go out
<78>
on
<69>
any auditions you got go to acting
<70>
class you got to get a professional headshots now let's talk about three more steps that every single actor needs to take the first one is to start finding auditions on your own and start auditioning for project you got to be able to do this yourself before
<51>
you get
<78>
an agent to do it
<69>
for you and nesse
<70>
after that is learning how to self tape so most auditions these days will request you to record your own audition at home instead of going live and in so you got learn how to record it at home and that's called a self tape you got to be able to do that as
<78>
get
<129>
professionally have
<70>
is most auditions for big movies and television shows you will never be able find on your own as an
<40>
two agents and for the agents
<70>
to pass on to their actors last year I was able to find
<69>
I think five or six auditions for big movies and television shows by myself on sites
<70>
Actors Access and you how many my
<69>
agent found
<70>
me over
<69>
a hundred
<70>
so I was able to find five or six but my agent found a hundred more for me so that's why it's so important at some point in career that you will need to get an eighth so those are three more steps that you will
<69>
need to take I'm
<78>
not going
<69>
to go in-depth into
<70>
each of those because I actually have
<69>
individual videos on each of those three topics I have a video on how to find auditions on your own and submit to them I have a video on
<70>
creating a great self tape at
<43>
home
<70>
and I a video on four ways to get a talent agent so I'll put links all three of those separate videos down in the description below I will also put a link down there for another video that's called the cost of an acting
<79>
career and in that video I
<70>
break down how much each of these things that we've just talked about will typically
<69>
cost
<70>
you so how much you should expect to pay for acting classes for headshots how much you should expect
<69>
it to pay an
<70>
so will
<69>
in the description
<70>
the last thing I to share with you today are few words
<79>
of inspiration
<70>
and encouragement
<69>
and
<70>
those words come from those words come from
<39>
the answers
<70>
to
<69>
my two questions
<70>
earlier on in this video why do you want be an actor and what
<52>
your goals are for
<70>
this career lien on those answers anytime the going gets tough in this career because it will for the faint of heart there's
<69>
going to a lot of
<70>
got it in you talk to any famous actor right now
<69>
and
<70>
they will tell you there have been times
<69>
early on
<70>
in their career where they thought about quitting every single actor in this career thinks about quitting and we need to push through that we need
<69>
a never-give-up
<70>
and one
<69>
way that
<70>
you can make sure you don't give up is that any time that you start feeling low
<40>
and
<70>
feeling down about this career
<69>
is always think
<70>
that
<69>
to why it is that you really want to become an actor and
<70>
think about those goals that you have for yourself and keep pushing forward all
<69>
