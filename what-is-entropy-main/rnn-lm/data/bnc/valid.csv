what what was the story about the witch again?
well  she she lived i think  up on the hill above here.
millfield land somewhere.
and she was supposed to be  a witch right enough and the men  from all round about here  er  had a  meeting about it and  they  i think met at the  barn of dale.
where was that?
dale's the farm  just over the hill.
and they all had their flails with them.
so they went to the kildingy well which was supposed to have some kind of magical properties you see and er i don't ken if it was a a holy well or exactly but it certainly was reputed to have  some kind of properties that could cure supposed to cure any disease save the black death.
so they went to the kildingy well and dipped their flails in the water.
to sanctify the whole operation.
and then they  and took this poor old wife  and they beat her to death with the flails.
and er they couldn't bury her in the in the kirkyard.
you see in consecrated ground so they buried her in this bit of wheat land at the muckle water there.
the millfield gupps.
so they say.
"and she was reported to have  er  have said when they when they took her out, that there would be nothing nothing grow on the site of the house but runcho and i don't know the they were awful hungry for land in that day you ken and there was quite, there was one occasion there was old folk just putting up with the house just to get the land that it stood on."
mhm.
so whether  the fact that they thought that she was a witch was maybe kind of half an excuse just for getting her the house i don't know.
but they they'll tell you that you can still see where the house was because there's a runcho grows there.
there's different stories about i know that  long ago about men being put their putting their houses just to and they just er demolished the house you ken and.
mhm.
just to get the land it was.
there was a man that used to that worked in the mill.
his initials is carved on a stone above the the kiln fire.
and i think it's eighteen sixty six.
peter  and  was a house just up the road hereabouts.
and he was just terrorized his house.
mhm.
and they .
put hens in his bed and  he come in one night and there was a a man a stray man you ken  an effigy of a man like  and it was hanging by the neck from a rafter in the house.
and i think they'd just been hounding him for a while and that was the last straw.
"and he came down he would have been working for he would have been at that time  my great grandfather maybe or  and he came down and he lived in lower millfield after that and just he was his house, they just had the house demolished."
blew it up.
mhm.
and then divided up the land.
mhm.
"you were telling about that witch story afore, is that something that your father told you?"
i think it must have been indeed.
mhm..
they are oh i don't ken when but  they must you ken obviously a long time ago  story.
mhm.
kind of  story.
er  well  story about the man from rathlesholm.
it was the harvest time and they were going to brew.
which they i you ken they were all all the houses would have  about harvest time.
and you ken and all their friends and neighbours came around to help with the harvest  they'd have this home brew.
so this man i think he came from rosevale.
which is out along the shore in rathlesholm.
and he was going to somewhere in north end i think it was huip to get barn to make this ale with.
so he got the barn and he he had it in a peedie pail you see and he was on his road home and he was coming by this that hillock at yensetter there.
and he heard this awful grand fiddle music.
"so he stopped and he listened to this and went to have a look, see what was going on."
and this was the trolls having a celebration of some kind.
and so er whether the trolls keened he was there or not i don't ken but he he was watching this all the all the dancing.
and listened to the awful grand music.
and he stood and listened to this for a while and then he thought he was delayed long enough so he set off home.
"when he was coming along the road, the they were sawing."
and there was a mark on his  finger where his the handle of the pail was just sunk into the flesh of his fingers he was stood there the whole winter listening to this music.
"i've heard one like that, i've heard about the one where the man goes into the  and and is there for years."
mm.
you know listening.
slightly different i think.
can you tell me about the one .
erm.
there was a there was a man from greentoft in eday supposed to be.
it was he was out at the caithes and it blew up a a gale a westerly gale and blew him across to norway you see.
and  he was likely in  poor shape by the time he got to norway.
but he survived it anyway and there was er folk found him there and kind of looked after him.
and nursed him back to health and whatnot.
and he was there but there was no way of getting back.
and he was there for quite a while.
at nights he used to go down to the shore and look out across the sea you see and he wondered what was happening back home at greentoft and fairly homesick.
and this had gone on for some time and he was down on the shore anyway one night and looking out across the the sea and thinking long for eday and he met this man.
and the man  was asking him what he was er  looking so mournful about and what.
"he said  he told him the story and he said if you could just get back to to greentoft, he says, i would give you the best two cattle my byre."
if i could just get back to greentoft.
so the man told him to be down there the same time next night and he returned .
so the next night this the man comes down to the shore and here was two men with a rowing boat.
this man he was spoken to the night afore and another one.
with a rowing boat.
i don't think he was just too impressed with this set up but  it was the only chance anyway so.
they got him in the boat and  they he had to lie down in the bottom of the boat and they and they covered him with a tarpaulin.
and he couldn't look out.
"so they got him settled in the bottom of the boat and just as they were putting this tarpaulin over him, and getting ready to set off, the one man he heard the one man saying to the other, he says, right, forty miles a wee stroke of the oars."
so they set off anyway and just in no time they were coming into the shore below greentoft.
and it didn't seem very long to the man anyway.
and er  he was just delighted to be back and  first thing he did was the house and  had a he had a look round and he was in the byre and had these two awful grand .
and he was awful proud of them.
and they were grown apiece while he was away and they were better than ever and the deal was been that he had was gonna give them the best two cattle you see and this was this was the best two animals he had.
he was very loath to part with them.
and he did consider taking the two the next  wasn't fairly so good.
mhm.
"but he thought, well that was the deal."
so he stuck by it so he loosed these two  and  them down to the shore.
"and the the first ones forefeet touch the deck of the boat, the boat just disappeared and it was the trolls that was taking him home."
and that was the last he saw of them?
and that was the last he saw of them.
and he didn't have to part with his cattle after all.
but what would have happened to him if he'd not  taken the cattle down i don't know.
that's another story with a an unusual ending cos i'd have thought when you were saying that he wasn't  that he didn't give them the.
