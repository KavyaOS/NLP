what what was the story about the witch again?
well  she she lived i think  up on the hill above here.
millfield land somewhere.
and she was supposed to be  a witch right enough and the men  from all round about here  er  had a  meeting about it and  they  i think met at the  barn of dale.
where was that?
dale's the farm  just over the hill.
and they all had their flails with them.
so they went to the kildingy well which was supposed to have some kind of magical properties you see and er i don't ken if it was a a holy well or exactly but it certainly was reputed to have  some kind of properties that could cure supposed to cure any disease save the black death.
so they went to the kildingy well and dipped their flails in the water.
to sanctify the whole operation.
and then they  and took this poor old wife  and they beat her to death with the flails.
and er they couldn't bury her in the in the kirkyard.
you see in consecrated ground so they buried her in this bit of wheat land at the muckle water there.
the millfield gupps.
so they say.
"and she was reported to have  er  have said when they when they took her out, that there would be nothing nothing grow on the site of the house but runcho and i don't know the they were awful hungry for land in that day you ken and there was quite, there was one occasion there was old folk just putting up with the house just to get the land that it stood on."
mhm.
so whether  the fact that they thought that she was a witch was maybe kind of half an excuse just for getting her the house i don't know.
but they they'll tell you that you can still see where the house was because there's a runcho grows there.
there's different stories about i know that  long ago about men being put their putting their houses just to and they just er demolished the house you ken and.
mhm.
just to get the land it was.
there was a man that used to that worked in the mill.
his initials is carved on a stone above the the kiln fire.
and i think it's eighteen sixty six.
peter  and  was a house just up the road hereabouts.
and he was just terrorized his house.
mhm.
and they .
put hens in his bed and  he come in one night and there was a a man a stray man you ken  an effigy of a man like  and it was hanging by the neck from a rafter in the house.
and i think they'd just been hounding him for a while and that was the last straw.
"and he came down he would have been working for he would have been at that time  my great grandfather maybe or  and he came down and he lived in lower millfield after that and just he was his house, they just had the house demolished."
blew it up.
mhm.
and then divided up the land.
mhm.
"you were telling about that witch story afore, is that something that your father told you?"
i think it must have been indeed.
mhm..
they are oh i don't ken when but  they must you ken obviously a long time ago  story.
mhm.
kind of  story.
er  well  story about the man from rathlesholm.
it was the harvest time and they were going to brew.
which they i you ken they were all all the houses would have  about harvest time.
and you ken and all their friends and neighbours came around to help with the harvest  they'd have this home brew.
so this man i think he came from rosevale.
which is out along the shore in rathlesholm.
and he was going to somewhere in north end i think it was huip to get barn to make this ale with.
so he got the barn and he he had it in a peedie pail you see and he was on his road home and he was coming by this that hillock at yensetter there.
and he heard this awful grand fiddle music.
"so he stopped and he listened to this and went to have a look, see what was going on."
and this was the trolls having a celebration of some kind.
and so er whether the trolls keened he was there or not i don't ken but he he was watching this all the all the dancing.
and listened to the awful grand music.
and he stood and listened to this for a while and then he thought he was delayed long enough so he set off home.
"when he was coming along the road, the they were sawing."
and there was a mark on his  finger where his the handle of the pail was just sunk into the flesh of his fingers he was stood there the whole winter listening to this music.
"i've heard one like that, i've heard about the one where the man goes into the  and and is there for years."
mm.
you know listening.
slightly different i think.
can you tell me about the one .
erm.
there was a there was a man from greentoft in eday supposed to be.
it was he was out at the caithes and it blew up a a gale a westerly gale and blew him across to norway you see.
and  he was likely in  poor shape by the time he got to norway.
but he survived it anyway and there was er folk found him there and kind of looked after him.
and nursed him back to health and whatnot.
and he was there but there was no way of getting back.
and he was there for quite a while.
at nights he used to go down to the shore and look out across the sea you see and he wondered what was happening back home at greentoft and fairly homesick.
and this had gone on for some time and he was down on the shore anyway one night and looking out across the the sea and thinking long for eday and he met this man.
and the man  was asking him what he was er  looking so mournful about and what.
"he said  he told him the story and he said if you could just get back to to greentoft, he says, i would give you the best two cattle my byre."
if i could just get back to greentoft.
so the man told him to be down there the same time next night and he returned .
so the next night this the man comes down to the shore and here was two men with a rowing boat.
this man he was spoken to the night afore and another one.
with a rowing boat.
i don't think he was just too impressed with this set up but  it was the only chance anyway so.
they got him in the boat and  they he had to lie down in the bottom of the boat and they and they covered him with a tarpaulin.
and he couldn't look out.
"so they got him settled in the bottom of the boat and just as they were putting this tarpaulin over him, and getting ready to set off, the one man he heard the one man saying to the other, he says, right, forty miles a wee stroke of the oars."
so they set off anyway and just in no time they were coming into the shore below greentoft.
and it didn't seem very long to the man anyway.
and er  he was just delighted to be back and  first thing he did was the house and  had a he had a look round and he was in the byre and had these two awful grand .
and he was awful proud of them.
and they were grown apiece while he was away and they were better than ever and the deal was been that he had was gonna give them the best two cattle you see and this was this was the best two animals he had.
he was very loath to part with them.
and he did consider taking the two the next  wasn't fairly so good.
mhm.
"but he thought, well that was the deal."
so he stuck by it so he loosed these two  and  them down to the shore.
"and the the first ones forefeet touch the deck of the boat, the boat just disappeared and it was the trolls that was taking him home."
and that was the last he saw of them?
and that was the last he saw of them.
and he didn't have to part with his cattle after all.
but what would have happened to him if he'd not  taken the cattle down i don't know.
that's another story with a an unusual ending cos i'd have thought when you were saying that he wasn't  that he didn't give them the.
mhm.
and something.
the nice ones and something happened .
terrible befell him but.
are there any more that you're  about trolls or whatever?
i don't think so agnes.
i've really you don't hear many stories about trolls .
mm.
"i mind them they used to say too when  afore having a  boiled egg, you know just peedie ."
insisted that they put the eggs  the shell.
when you were peedie.
which i don't think mum entirely approved of cos she.
seemed to think it was just quite proper table etiquette maybe but.
and it was the fairies wouldn't sail away in the eggshells.
mm.
but you.
well it it was this this old wife had a a fairy that lived with her and apparently it wasn't an uncommon thing.
and the fairies was  boat you see but they were kind of wandering kind of things.
and this fairy was it was found an eggshell.
so it'd got this eggshell in the bottom and they used they would work a  a mast  a sail on it.
and they'd got this eggshell in the bottom anyway and away it went.
and it sailed off to a island that it came to.
and there was just a whole loads of fairies on this island.
and the peedie fairy was just delighted to start with but soon realized that there was something fishy going on and it wasn't a very happy place.
and it turned out that there was a big goblin that lived on this island and he just ate fairies.
and he used to come around everyday and kind of size them up and pick the kind of fat juicy ones.
and he would tell them that when he was going back to get  gonna be his next meal.
and er the fairies was gradually disappearing.
so it wasn't a very happy island right enough.
"but this peedie fairy anyway, it was  wandering about one day very disconsolate at the prospect and found a sparrow with a broken wing."
so it  nursed this sparrow you see and got its wing bandaged up and whatnot.
and er and the sparrow started to get better and er it was starting to fly a peedie but again and was just getting its strength back.
and this goblin came along one day and says to this peedie fairy that like he was coming to get her in the morning.
so  tearing off to find the sparrow.
and er the sparrow thought he would maybe make it back to the mainland now so the peedie fairy climbed on his back and the sparrow flew it back to the mainland.
and the peedie fairy came back and lived with the old wife  been afore.
and it never wandered any more after that it was seen enough of the big bad world outside.
but the old wife  always put he egg spoon through the bottom of the eggshell when she had a boiled egg after that.
i've never ever heard of that before.
is that something that other folk on stronsay know or is just something you.
i don't know.
there's maybe not enough folk knew it because i don't know that there's very many fairies around .
no.
.
where there never many ghost stories  speak about some of them but.
och i don't ken.
there's not very many black  stories here that you've heard .
and then came back and took a woman back with them as their servant .
are there many in stronsay that you've heard of or not?
that happened in stronsay.
did it?
mhm.
tell me about that then.
erm well  but the the descendants of them still here.
is that so?
mhm.
i mean it's happened all over but.
but there's no ghost stories or.
no.
anything associated with it.
but i believe it did did happen.
mhm.
ghost stories.
ah i don't ken there's not really an an awful lot of ghost stories.
there's lower millfield's supposed to be haunted.
you see and it's likely one of the oldest houses on the island.
you ken it's well among the oldest houses on the island.
"when you say that, roughly how old do you think  have you got any idea how old it is?"
no i haven't a clue.
the mill has been i don't ken how long there's been a mill on the site there but the mill as it stands 's been there from eighteen sixty.
mhm.
eighteen sixty one is the year it was heightened and extended and whatnot.
but there's there was a peedie single story building there.
mhm.
before that.
"and you can see on the gable end just here, you know where it's been heightened  you can see the the old gable end."
and there was a there was two water wheels.
one where the water wheel is now.
that was fed by the .
but there was another wheel at the other end and there was a loch that the the there were hill fields up between .
the toft mill at the other end.
and  as i say as i say i don't ken how long it had been there but that see that  likely about the same time as the as the mill was heightened and er the kiln would've been putting on.
you see there wouldn't have been a kiln at the mill before that i think it  every house had their own kiln and they dried their own you ken.
dried their own grain afore they took it to the mill.
"but so about the same time as the mill was heightened, i think that land was drained."
for my grand uncle could mind the man that dug the ditch that drained it.
"you ken, he was an old man then ."
mhm.
in about nineteen sixties.
mhm.
sometime.
mhm.
and that bit that comes right .
mhm.
that's right.
mhm.
that's right.
and.
you don't have any idea.
no i've never heard of the mill being on anywhere different from where.
no.
it is now.
no.
so i would think it's just always been at that that site.
what what was what was the ghost story ?
"i don't ken, nobody ken's where the ghost came from."
or who it is really.
i think i've heard that that it it it was er it was the doctor's house some time.
i don't ken how far back that is.
but er there was something about a servant lass that got  pregnant.
and committed suicide to avoid the scandal.
or something.
so it's possibly her that.
aha.
that haunts the place.
mhm.
but it just manifests itself very very rarely.
have you ever heard it yourself?
no.
no.
but mum has heard it.
maybe twice.
and dad had heard it.
and what form did that take?
i mean if they heard.
it it makes an awful racket sometimes.
and always at night.
terrible bangs and things that there's just no explanation for.
but.
no no.
just noise.
the the last time that it happened was er  on it must be maybe twenty year ago or so.
there was a beautiful night in the summertime and the house was just full of women.
"there was mum and her and my grandmother, her mother."
"and eleanor, sister."
there was a friend of eleanor's from austria in the house and kathleen.
yeah there was  five women and dad was away and i was out at the fishing  just for the night.
"and i came home about i don't ken, maybe eight o'clock in the morning or something  a beautiful morning."
flat calm.
and here all these women was up   and er  the ghost was surely been performing that night.
they'd heard this awful racket you see and they'd thought it was me coming and falling or something on the stairs.
"but you ken, very early in the morning."
mhm.
"and they all, they got up in the morning and i wasn't home still."
and  must have been the ghost.
eleanor heard it .
aha.
yes i'm sure.
eleanor was there.
mhm.
"i don't know, it's not a very malicious ghost anyway, just."
unexplained noises.
just the sort of unexplained noises  thirty year or so.
were you speaking to  about another ghost story  or was that the one ?
no i.
no.
i don't ken .
there's not really many ghost stories on the island i don't think.
that was the one that i'd heard about .
what about any  other stories linked with characters around about here that you've heard?
old characters that maybe you don't mind but you've heard spoken about.
i.
to take you further on in your  about nationalization.
"er had it been something that you'd long sought after you know, like like in the mines where it had been an issue for some years?"
"you know, during the war years ?"
"er well nationalization during the war, the  er nationalization and war news were interspersed you know, i mean the when you hadn't any war news to talk about, you spoke about nationalization."
after the war we'll get nationalization you see.
but that was er er a a faint hope.
"before before we could get nationalization, we had to get a labour government."
"and i and many others thought that the tories, after the war was finished, the tories would walk in."
the fact that churchill was the great leader.
and never in my wildest dream did we imagine that labour would get in with the resounding majority that they did get in.
but however nationalization was always on the minds of the railwaymen.
and we learnt the minds of various other big heavy industries.
"do you recall nationalization being an issue that was talked about in the work place, you know was it talked about in the buffets and in the union meetings and."
yes.
"erm firstly i mean,during the war ?"
"during the war well  while the war as going on  nationalization was brought up in the buffets by what we would term now, the activist or militant labour people."
"they were always broaching that subject, nationalization."
"because they believed and they got me to believe at the time, that nationalization would be the cure for all our ills."
"it would cure unemployment, it would give the workers control of their own industries and that everything would be hunkydory."
"there was a lot of talk but you always had these people who sons and that in the army, and they would always come in with the war situation."
"so as i said, it was interspersed you know it was ."
but i don't think there were any anyone that i knew on the railway were not against nationalization.
"they were all for nationalization, because they believed that nationalization was the only way to solve the problems of the development the future development of the railways."
"because you must remember during the wars, the railway stocks were being run down."
"you see even the the workshops, the railway workshops were working very hard you know, but they were only making make do and mend style."
and there were no new stock built during the wars.
"so it meant that by the end of the war, the railway stock, the carriages, locomotives and all that was on their last stages."
okay?
"and that's why at that time, near the end of the war,and when the talk of nationalization become greater, the hope of nationalization because as i said before, never in our wildest dream did we think that labour would get in with such an overwhelming majority."
"but the the the railway stock was in such a bad state, that that's when people started the real activists of the labour movement really started talking about confiscation compensation."
"because there was a great tory voice sounded throughout the press and the mass media you see, that er on compensation for the railways, if there ever should be nationalization that they had to be amply compensated you see."
"and then they come in the labour activists come in with this, no compensation, confiscation, the  was worth tuppence you know."
"but i don't know how it was, but it came about that this confiscation business was dropped just we labour got into power."
"that the government got into power, that seemed to be put aside, confiscation."
"no we had to be fair, was the saying, for the leaders."
"we have to be fair, we've got to give them the compensation."
"you see, a fair price for their stocks and their holdings."
"disappointed me i know, because i knew from where i stood, that the stuff was practically worthless."
"it would have to be renewed the the nationalization was prepared to go, the government took over."
"now workers control, that's what it meant to me."
i was gonna take you that you know.
what did workers understand by and mean by nationalization and what did they want from nationalization?
well.
was workers control a prominent part of people's thinking on this like?
"it was a prominent part of people's thinking, worker's thinking."
that they had more say in the running of their industry of the railway.
"now the first disappointment in that respect was the appointment now i may be wrong but i'm i'm i'm i think i'm right here  the appointment of the chairman of the railway executive, that's what it was first called."
it wasn't called the railway board.
"the first chairman i'm sure it was, lord robbins alf robbins."
a labour minister.
"now i might say it here, at this point that alf robbins was just another social democratic party member."
that's what he was on that at that time.
"and this is forty eight, nineteen forty eight."
"he was a right, right and ultra right  labour party, and he was made the first chairman."
now i knew him for what he was as a right softly softly.
"you know, all things to all men man."
but he was our he was on the national executive.
"i don't know what position, ministerial position he held i just forget, at the time."
but he was a prominent figure from the labour party.
and he was made chairman of the railway executive.
"now i smelt a mice then you see, i i my own personal thoughts were, what's what's the idea of appointing a a real go ahead executive member, why did they put him in."
i learned later that he was just another capitalist.
"so after about a year, eighteen month, i could see by his dictates that we weren't going to have worker's control in the real sense of the word."
true they set up er local departmental committees and sectional councils.
and they had the whole machinery negotiations fixed you see.
"but as the years went on, they were useless i mean er they were just talking shops."
and the management always came out tops you see.
"so within about three years, my hopes were dashed."
"i realized then that nationalization, the great the great nationalization enterprise was simply state capitalism."
it was just capitalism continued.
only the people were paying for it taxes.
the well to do investing in in shares and that.
it was the people that were being drawn by the nose and paying for the whole thing.
er.
how did you see nationalization being put into effect?
er i mean in the sense of actually er on in the railway yards itself er themselves.
you know were there any immediate changed that er were apparent to you?
no.
"there were no immediate changes, it went on from private enterprise, the changeover we were told at the time that we were just just to carry on the way we'd been doing."
see.
er there were some dubious appointments as er yardmasters.
"see before nationalization, it used to be men who rose form the ranks that got the jobs, you know, men that knew the job."
"after nationalization, there was quite a number of university graduate appointed as yard masters, station masters."
without any railway experience.
they read up the transport laws at university and all that transport and everything.
but they had no practical experience you see.
"and i remember one, a yorkshireman he was appointed yardmaster of portobello yard,and  where i worked."
the three yards that were under him.
and he had assistants at each yard you see.
"he was a hale fellow well met sort of yorkshireman you know, a bluff yorkshireman."
"a nice enough chap and he was knowledgeable in theory you see, but when it come to the practical experience and the practical doing of the work, he would just say, well what did you do the last time jimmy?"
and i said  like this.
i would tell him.
well do the same.
you see?
so that was er the blue eyed boys period.
"but strangely enough that went out, it came in with a flush see?"
and there were you could see them all over british railways.
"ex graduates you know, university boys getting positions there."
and the story was that they were er ex railway shareholder's sons or you know all this.
that's how they were placed in the position you see.
"alf robbins, lord robbins as he was then, knew what was going on."
he must have agreed to all this.
getting the go ahead.
and he went it.
"but as i said, that finished after about five or six year."
and then they started recruiting or or or promoting them from the ranks you know.
step steps.
"each step you see was promotion and er i think about nineteen fifty five, we started about nineteen fifty five aye after about seven years."
"the railway started to what i could only term, improve."
it started to improve.
"because there were men there who had the experience, knew what they were doing, knew what their mates were capable of and not capable of you know."
knew their shortcomings and their capabilities.
"and that's when the railways i thought, nineteen fifty five to nineteen sixty, there were a great surge forward."
ideas coming forward.
trade unionism taking a grip.
on the railways.
a real grip.
"there had been trade unions before of course, and er activity but not to the same extent between fifteen er nineteen fifty five to sixty, there was a great surge forward."
"the railways railwaymen were demanding more, because they felt quite rightly that they were giving more to the railways."
and therefore they wanted the rewards that go with it.
"nationalization was dead as far as i was concerned, we were back in the rat race."
and that's when we started putting in for annual wage increases.
see previous to that it was maybe every five years you put in for a wage increase a wage application.
"between er in the late nineteen fifties, that's when we stated going."
"going ahead and it started with annual wage increases because the wage increases that you did get were all about three, four or five percent at the time."
and that only lasted you you see.
of the living in the standard of living was slightly better for those who were working.
slightly better than it had been previously.
i'd like to take you back to that this whole idea that you've you've expressed about the idea of of state capitalism.
"er how nationalization in effect as you've described it, existed for about maybe ten years."
yeah.
"before people twigged if you like, that what had actually happened amounted to hardly anything more than a change of sort of managerial personnel."
er.
is that how you you saw it?
"aye well you see when we did twig,the great deception you know, and it's worthwhile recalling here that we had richard marsh  i think he's a title now  sir richard marsh."
he was another labour great labour mouthpiece.
another s d p man see.
"lord beeching, a tory tory."
he came and he just slashed the railways you see.
it seemed that they were either capitalist or social democrats which i mean a social democrat by any other a tory by any other name's just the same.
i mean there there's no difference.
as i've said before you're either red or or blue or black and white.
"but anyway, the railways there was a spurt on between in the late sixties on the railway and that's when i think i was sure, not only because i was a branch secretary at the time but i'm sure that all the  british railways there was a greater awareness of the fact that we had been deceived by the word nationalization."
it wasn't anything like workers control as we had expected.
"it was just old old private enterprise, private railways back in, only there were no different region, there were no l m s, l n e r, g w r or that."
they were all one.
i'd like to take take you back to the the changeover itself.
"do you remember much about the the attitude of the of the old l n e r management you know, er especially during the lead-up from labour coming to power, and it becoming more obvious that nationalization would in fact take place?"
do you remember much about how the old managers felt about that?
the old managers?
"aye well at that time, in nineteen forty eight, i was detached i mean i i didn't know much about the management's thinking, or their pronouncements."
see.
but i can remember one thing that happened in in that respect was that the superintendent came down to a meeting or he wanted to see us after nationalization.
"and it was all about er, we're nationalized railway nationalized, it meant that we could er gain promotion and we wouldn't be confined to the one section."
"there'd be no l n e r, no l m s, see."
well that was the only two railways that affected us.
the l n e r and l m s. and er i could see then that i knew that superintendent in the private days of the railways.
"and  few years, and yet he said a long face, if you wasn't you wasn't happy with the thought of running a district that was nationalized see?"
but it as it turned out he needn't have had no fears.
see?
because he was just doing the same job as he'd been doing under the private  under the l n e r. management were more conciliatory when nationalization came on.
"see in pre-nationalization days, a superintendent was the big chief."
"when he appeared in the yard, you had to jump it."
the red carpet literally was out for him you see.
"but after nationalization, it was obvious, when he did put in an appearance or and that was very rare, there wasn't the same palaver for his visit."
he would just came and went into the yardmaster's office and had a word or two with him and then he would maybe ask to see the staff local representative and the local  committee.
"and he'd have a word, er how's everything going along?"
alright and er you're quite happy with things as they are and that?
"and that would be the extent of his visit, he would have a cursory look round the yard and away."
"but there was no er pointing this out and pointing that out, that's wrong, as he did as they did in the pre-nationalization days."
it seemed to me that they assumed and air of couldn't care less you know that that was their attitude after nationalization.
couldn't care less and they were just there until their time for retirement was .
they didn't like it .
they didn't like it .
but as i said they need have no fear.
you made some interesting points there with your er your suggestion that the idea of a different relationship with management was there.
"you know, there were knew structures and new procedures for the unions and."
yes.
that kind of thing.
how did you how do you recall that?
well there was a new machinery of negotiations set up.
"and strangely enough, the branch, the branches were not in the machinery of negotiations."
they were excluded from the negotiations.
"but what happened was, if a member of my branch had a complaint, he would come to me as secretary and complain."
"and  i should have told him, if you've any complaints, come to the branch meeting and make your complaints there."
but er i knew that it wasn't always possible for one to be at the branch meeting you see.
"so anyway, that was it, you had to go to your branch and complain, make your protest in writing, see, and the branch secretary would reply to your letter okay, and they'd ask for maybe a few more details about the complaint."
"and then he would take that complaint, if the branch committee approved it, you see, or nine times ten if the branch secretary thought it was a valid case, he would send it in a  letter to the  sectional council."
"you see, from portobello branch to the sectional council scottish region."
"er stating the case you see, stating out the case."
and urgent you know  on it immediately see.
"well that went to the secretary of the sectional council, and that's when the negotiating machinery of negotiation started."
"it would maybe take they held meetings the sectional councils held meetings, every three month, every quarter."
"now there were sectional councils in every region you see, for different regions,scotland ."
scotland was one region.
"and the management, top management in in scotland would meet er representatives for the n u r and they would discuss it."
"the a s l e n f, they were a different they had a they had a sectional council of their own you see, for local men."
"and then there was a sectional council number three, that was for guards, shunters, ticket collectors and various other grades."
"and they would have that meeting and they would maybe last, the meeting would maybe last a week you see, it was held in glasgow."
and er at the end of it you were issued with a a report you see.
"the sectional council minutes, the minutes would come out, and they were distributed to all the yards and depots."
"and you would see the case of er er j , head shunter , protests at being superseded for yard foreman's job at ."
see?
"well the branch secretary would give all the data, information regarding that, you see, and why as a protest why he shouldn't have been superseded you see."
"and er  invariably it would come out, the reply  not conceded."
or protest not not sustained you see.
"it was amazing, i think you had one about a hundred conceded."
"so much for the n u r and a s l n f. although i will say, the driver's union, the a s l n f, their sectional council got more from their anyway, than did the n u r ."
i'm sorry to say.
because  well i don't know they seemed to be more active.
more interested in the real issues you see?
on the railways and the conditions of their members.
"but that was a fact under the sectional council number three, the one that i was represented by, they seemed to be poor."
"or the management seemed to be better, okay?"
"but then if that not conceded or protest not sustained, that would the letter would come back to the official letter would come back to the branch secretary you see, and he would look at it, and he would put it to his branch  and if they wanted to go further, that went to euston house, the n u r headquarters, euston house."
for the to go forward to the r s m c and that was railway staff national council.
"that was held in london you see, the headquarters."
"management, top management and the n e c or the n u r and that's when it went to there and it was discussed and dealt with at that level."
"there was another higher body, like an arbitration council,dealing with railways, but er that was very seldom used."
"it was more for wage negotiations and various other conditions of service, general conditions of service, not individual."
i'd like you to just summarize your your your feeling on on nationalization.
"er that kind of  idea that er you know, whether any changes at all that you thought that you appreciated er in that made workers feel that they were in fact a more important a more important part of their industry?"
just to summarize your feelings on nationalization .
aye.
"well i don't think we felt any more important, at the beginning, we had great hopes you see, on nationalization, but they quickly faded you see, and we were soon lulled into a sense of hopelessness."
"very soon you know, months years."
we knew that right away that there were there were no future.
"here labour government by the appointment of lord robbins, and one of  calibre who couldn't care less."
he gave more more decisions against the workers than he ever gave for them.
"and er he wanted the railways to be run, like clockwork."
without any concessions .
his wage concessions were negligible.
. and that's when we saw that the railways would just have been run under private enterprise.
"nationalization was a pie in the sky, and the pie fell to the ground very soon."
"well generally speaking, how did that that awareness affect your feeling and other people's feeling about the forty five government?"
er.
the ninety forty er the nineteen forty five government?
did you feel that people had that same kind of disillusionment with the government more generally speaking?
yes.
"there was one great hero, in that nineteen forty five government and that was ni bevan."
"he seemed to me and many others, i think we were in common agreement, most of the people that i was associated with, that ni bevan was the only man that really cared you know, he really cared."
"he came from wales , from the valleys and that."
"and er i heard him speaking twice when he was in edinburgh, wonderful orator, but not only that, you see we have neil kinnock, present day, good orator, good articulate ."
"but he lacks  the intensity of feeling that ni bevan had, he lacks it."
i mean the the caring feeling oozed ni bevan.
"when he introduced his national health service, a wonderful scheme, everything was free, it was paid of the taxes you know, as it should be as beveridge envisaged you see?"
"ni bevan took it up, introduced it, put it through parliament, and then , it was running wonderful wonderfully well."
everybody working and women were getting false teeth and new glasses.
i was gonna ask you how working people what working people felt about it when it was first introduced ?
"aye oh, this was the greatest thing the greatest thing that could have happened to the people."
because that we only had the lloyd george nineteen eleven scheme.
where the wage earner only got free dental treatment and free medical treatment you see.
the wife and family the wife and family didn't the wife and family didn't er benefit in any way.
the worker paid his contribution and that was for  own benefit.
"shocking when you think of it isn't it, your wife and family."
"you had to pay them five shillings a visit to the doctor, and then your spectacles or any dental treatment you got, you had to pay for them."
a shilling a week you know you had to pay out.
"but anyway as i said, ni bevan put that through."
he was greater than attlee.
"attlee was a good leader i believe, he went about it surreptitiously you know, he wasn't a vociferous sort of chap, he was a quiet man."
but er his lieutenants were there and i'm sure he looked to see that they were doing their job properly.
"ni bevan and then, when gateskill came on, maybe that's going too far ahead, but never mind."
"i remember er ni bevan, he tore gateskill to ribbons."
when gateskill was leader of the labour party.
"when he proposed a shilling on prescriptions, one shilling and that's at that time, ni bevan started himself started to deteriorate."
but i can remember ni bevan calling gateskill for everything for this.
it spoilt his whole scheme of things.
gateskill.
"and from then they've increased, increased, increased and still it's the national health service is a farce now."
"it strikes me though that at that time, at the time of the forty five government that, nationalization, the national health service became."
that was the centre .
the centrepiece.
"the national health service was the greatest thing, the greatest achievement of the labour government."
there's no doubt about that.
"if people just sit and think about it, the national health service you know?"
"security and health that's from the cradle to the grave, it's a wonderful a wonderful thing."
and ni bevan obviously felt that for he fought tooth and nail to get it through.
"mind you must remember at the time when he was fighting to put it through, the bill through parliament, the whole b m a, british medical association were against him, to a man."
they had the socialists medical association well there'd be they'd be on the side of bevan.
but er the b m a were totally and absolutely against this er national health service.
but he won.
"and it was mainly destroyed by the labour party, future labour parties."
mainly destroyed.
i'd like to take you back to one or two more aspects of your actual work on the railways.
erm from the war onwards.
er you were still a head shunter for i think about five years after after.
aye.
aye.
the war.
er i wanted you to maybe describe some more of the responsibilities and duties you had in that job.
"i mean, making up the rosters ."
er how was that done and how were they handed out and that that kind of thing?
"aye well you see there was a a local departmental committee, of which i was the employees' employees' side, of which i was secretary."
and it was a responsibility of the l d c.  it was the management's side and the workers' side combined.
their responsibility was to see that the rosters were properly worked out you see.
"and er inevitably , we always fell to the secretary you see."
and i used to make out the rosters.
". and then soon after that, the rest day, the five day week came out you see, where you got a rest day every week."
and it was the l d c who were responsible for making out the rest day rosters you see.
"the top management didn't bother about that, they know left it to the local you see."
it didn't  you see.
"now it was strange at the time, i only represented the shunters and the guards and the lower grades, i didn't represent the supervisors, yard inspectors at the time."
"but the yard one of the yard inspectors came to me and said, i wonder if you would make up a roster for the supervisors ."
"of which there were six, seven."
so i made a roster out for the for the supervisors which meant that every week they got a rest day.
one day in the week off.
"and every month, they got the friday, saturday, and sunday off you see."
three days off every month.
and this was great.
"they adopted it right away, the management thought it was too too long their work you see."
but the supervisors was fair away with this.
so that was adopted.
see?
roster stayed from about nineteen when was it?
"er i don't know, nineteen fifty, right until the day i left in nineteen seventy six."
"that roster was still in operation, the supervisor's one."
er that was one of the duties.
"then , suggestions was another thing for the improvement in working practices and working conditions."
there was always there were always adverse against the management.
"the management were always against carriage cleaners getting a rest day, they didn't think they needed one."
"imagine, because they were a lower grade they'd meant nothing you see."
"so i made out a roster, and there were over a hundred carriage cleaners at  and i made out a roster for them."
rest day rosters.
"and i put it to the some of the women and men cleaners you see, how would like a rest day roster?"
"oh that would be wonderful, that'd be great."
you see.
oh that'd be great.
"see and they got a monday this week, a tuesday next week, wednesday, thursday, friday, that's how i made it you see."
"and then saturday, it meant they got off on the sunday and the monday, they got their long weekend you see, when they reached the saturday."
oh this'd be wonderful.
"oh but we'll not get it, we'll not get it jimmy, no."
won't get it.
"i said, well we'll have a go anyway."
well it took about six month with me arguing and arguing and arguing.
oh it would take too many spare people rest day .
"so, oh aye, they  take about twelve rest day staff, extra staff to allow it."
well i got it whittled down to six extra.
and i settled for that.
"you see, and it was a just a bit of a trick, i was putting in the rosters you see."
"now duty rosters, trains, all the different trains that have got to be clean you see, and i was putting in ten minutes less than really would be required you see, and that saved er hours you see, saved hours."
and i brought it down to half a dozen staff.
it was a bit of a twist but  the management didn't notice it.
or they didn't care.
and it was conceded.
that er the railway wasn't  satisfying my my my needs.
"you see, when i became an inspector on the railway eventually,it was like a fire being damped down."
you see?
"and that's when i felt that i wished i had of went for a career in the trade union or i felt that had i done that, i would have been satisfying something that was there."
that's always been there.
however it was too late then.
i had made my decision and i'd taken the first step.
"now the first step was from  as i said earlier, i had stayed too long at  i thought."
with my family growing up i was needing more money and er that's when i decided i would apply for a foreman's job at .
"well to cut a long story short, and bear in mind the fact that seniority and everything took precedence over everything else, all things being equal."
er i got the job at .
"i was quite interested in that actually because you you did imply at an earlier stage that er although seniority was the the important principle in in gaining promotion, er there was no harm done if  in your favour  you know."
aye.
er .
"well what with my at , for years at , i had made my mark, not only at  but throughout the east of scotland with trade union activities and various other things."
and i'm not sure whether i was the senior man or not.
"i assumed i was the senior man but one of my mates, a very good pal of mine  to me, a senior shunter, he says, oh you'll get the job, they'll be wanting to get rid of you jimmy."
you see.
"well anyway, i don't know what was true or not or what what was right, but i thought i'd got it through seniority and we'll leave it at that."
"i got the job at  and  i'd had i'd had experience, i knew that going to  was no problem."
cos  was a small small .
compared to .
was about ten times the size of it.
"and  only catered for  street station, which was a small station, it was being run down at that time, street station."
"see this was after the nationalization and the policy of the railway executive at that time was to two stations in one town, they were all they were reducing it to one station you see."
and  was the most modern station so it was obvious  street was on the way out.
"however, that would be a few years, take a few years before that happened."
so anyway i got to  and i was amazed at the opposition i got from the two or three staff shunters at .
"you see, to let you understand, this was maybe about four or five years after nationalization and nationalization , was under the l m s, street station and  were under the l m s and  was under the l n e r. but when i arrived at , i heard them talking about the callie see, the callie railway."
"that was pre-l m s, see, caledonian railway."
shows you how far back they were and how how their thoughts ran.
"and they called me an n b man, a north british railway man."
where i was a  l n e r you see.
so the the their thoughts were away in the past and they hadn't moved i thought and i learned later that my thoughts were correct.
they hadn't moved with the times.
"they were still doing jobs at   that were long since dispensed with at  you know, marshalling and that and methods that adopted and the shunting techniques."
but what amazed me as i said before was their antagonism to strangers.
"it's laughable but at the time it wasn't laughable but when you think back, this man that i was put on with, he was acting guard foreman."
he come from  he was .
"and er he thought he was the bee's knees you see, he thought he knew everything about railways."
because he knew the job at .
and er he wouldn't tell me which you see there's there's things in the railway in every place in every job there's er  dodges you know.
and techniques that are peculiar to that job.
"but he didn't tell me that and i knew there would be you see, but he didn't tell me these things."
"however, it took me two or three weeks to learn them, to pick them up."
"for he wasn't clever enough to hide them, exactly, he stumbled through you see and and er they they were exposed you see, for all to see."
and i was there with my ready eyes to pick them up.
"er  , he would get a message the phone would ring and he would answer it."
"he always rushed to the phone, he wouldn't let me answer the phone you see."
always rushed to the phone.
and he would get a message from er  street station from the station inspector.
"er he wants two two or three coaches for this and that and for a special to liverpool you see, he'd need it later that afternoon."
"and er he wouldn't tell me what the message was you see, he would just say, well go across to the other yard and shunt out a couple of coaches you see."
wouldn't even tell me the coaches you know.
and we'd go across and i would help him to couple up the various coaches and that.
"and we'd shut them out shunt them out and then we'd collect the two coaches and take them over to the main yard, and put them under a cleaning platform you see for the cleaners."
"and he would go away, he wouldn't say, come on we'll go down to the cleaners  and tell them , he would go away himself you see."
"and i wasn't a sheeplike person you see, i didn't follow him i just let him go."
"and er then i would see the two two or three cleaners coming out and going the coach and cleaning them, and i would say to them, what are they for?"
"oh er they're for some job at  street, they're wanting it for some job or other."
didn't even tell me it was for  a special train for er liverpool you know.
to go to carstairs and connect with the glasgow portion to liverpool.
"and that went on for two or three weeks you know, and  i said to the  the station master  at  when he came across on his once a week visits he would come across."
how are you getting on jimmy? he would ask.
"i says, och, this is a a toy place it is."
this is not a railway.
i says.
they're a way back about a hundred years here.
what do you mean?
what do you mean?
he says.
"i says, well er we're going about here, the two shunters are going about here and they're vying with to see how much they can ignore me."
"i says, why  let me go on  see i was getting about a month learning you see."
"i says, i'll go next week this was after three weeks, i says, i'll go on next week and i'll take over the job of yard foreman, and i'll do it the way i want it done, not the way that ."
do you think you'll be ready for that?
"i says, i have been ready for the last week."
"i says, a fortnight at this place is long enough to pick it up."
"i says, so i want to cut the ordeal short, i says, and i'll go on next week."
that were three weeks you see.
"oh well, i'll tell er  street then."
well i got word from  street that er i was to take my full month you see.
"that was er this chap  who answered the phone, aye that's er  street saying you can take the full month for learning."
"and i says, give me the phone then."
what are you doing?
"what are you i says, i'm ringing."
was that the station master aye.
"so i got onto the i says, hello is that the station  mr ?"
yes.
yes.
"i says, this is j  at er ."
"i says er, i want to go on as yard foreman next week."
oh you're supposed to .
"i says, aye, but i'm with this i says, i'm learning nothing."
"i says er, i want to take charge, and i'll do it the way that i think it should be done."
"so after a few words, he says, oh well, right i'll put you through as yard foreman from next week."
so i took on as yard took on as yard foreman on the following monday.
much to the resentment of the other you see.
"and i didn't go about it in a bombastic way or anything like that, i just gave them their orders you see, the two shunters."
"i says, what we'll do, first of all you know, we'll go across to the other yard and shunt out so and so and so and so."
you see you used to get a a sheet from  street for the week's work.
"and then any extra specials that come up in the meantime, they would send out send out a wee typewritten sheet you see."
"so that's where i got my instructions, very simple no bother ."
so i took over from then and er i just ignored what they was you know.
we usually  this way and that way.
"i said, ah well we've got to be different."
"i says, we're doing it the right way, the proper way now you see."
and er well things got on and er gradually i had .
and they were had no alternative but to accept it.
"well i was there about eighteen months and i was still active as a branch secretary for the n u r, the portobello branch."
"and er there was two or three or the carriage cleaners, men and women at , who er were in edinburgh number one branch ."
"and er they used to come to me and ask things about what they should do and did i think they had a claim for this and that you know, and i used to tell them you see."
but  i forget the exact date it was fifty two or fifty one or fifty two but the n u r  were threatening a strike to strike over a wage claim.
"they'd been offered something, two or three percent and they's rejected it and they were threatening strike action."
and er their members were agreed to strike action.
they'd taken a ballot and the members had agreed.
"and er i wrote  to the no we'd taken the decision at the portobello branch that sunday that we when we supported the executive decision, the strike for our just demand you see."
"and this got out, seemingly to the news."
the edinburgh evening news.
and i was working at  this day and being a monday or a tuesday after the sunday meeting.
and one of the reporters came out and er he asked me he's heard that our decision was to go out for a strike you see.
well edinburgh number one were noncommittal.
they just said they would support any action the executive took you see.
"but portobello branch went further  they were urging you see, the national executive committee, to take industrial action immediately you see."
"this is what they believed the news were out for you see, a statement."
"and i says, you come into the foreman's hut, to the reporter i says, and i'll give you a statement."
"see i says, i'll give you the the resolution that was adopted at portobello."
"i says, and i'll add something else, the secretary's view."
"and again i wrote it out for him you know, wrote it all out."
"now, i says, er i'll read it out to you."
"he says, that's what i want."
"so  you know, and there was quite a big column, there were one column in the edinburgh evening news, and it's in my my wee red book there."
"at portobello branch you see, urging the national executive to take immediate action their claim for so and so ."
so this er oh was great news for the  carriage cleaners and .
and they were wanting to some of them anyway wanted to join the portobello branch.
"i said, no no."
"i says, we're all one union, i says, it doesn't matter what branch you're in, i says, this is your area you see."
"however, things went on very well at  after that."
"i was accepted after about three month or four month you know, i was accepted as one of the."
"it's interesting though that that you talked about that sort of identifying with the old companies, even in the nationalization days."
aye.
was that a common thing  was that something that  i presume.
i.
it wasn't unique to .
"i understand that this was pretty common, quite common throughout british railways, it took a few years to to knit together you know, the nationalization and the fact that we were just the same railway after that."
you see.
the l m s used to be the biggest of the railways you see.
"and er they thought they were the big cheese you see,those who worked there ."
but er they were no better than and no worse than the the others either.
". however, after about eighteen month at , as a yard foreman, as i say i was still branch secretary of portobello branch, and carrying on , er i put in for there were this yard inspectors job wanted at  street station."
"and i applied for that job, and i got it."
"now yard inspector at er  street station, seemed a there were there were there were only half a dozen sidings, outside the station at  street, see."
"outside the platform and er as i said before, it was like , they only  had small trains you know, five coaches was the biggest train they had you know."
and that was the liverpool.
the rest were maybe three or four coaches.
because they went from from  street station.
"to the edinburgh, the scotland passengers, to carstairs to connect the main glasgow central to liverpool, birmingham and there were all these places."
and london.
"so it was quite a simple job and , as yard inspector at  street, my job was to see that the platforms were always when one train left you had to put the other train in to get the shunters to shunt another train into the empty platform you see, for the next the next shunt and that and if a train came in from carstairs you see, you seen that the pilot and phoned the signalman, let the pilot into number five dock."
"but er it was quite a simple job and er i liked it, then now and again i used to walk down to the station master's or the station inspector's office you know, have a chat with him and and get the gen on what was for the weekend working you see."
and er they had a quaint a queer way of working.
which the head station inspector was an old chap douglas  was his name.
dougie  we called him.
"and what dougie said, that went for the rest of them."
they all kowtowed after dougie you see.
"because he was the  you know,anyway,this day i was just standing blathering away to dougie and one of the inspectors says, er the monday holiday, this would be the friday the previous to the monday."
"er on monday the edinburgh holiday, now er i'll need for the birmingham, will we need an extra coach for that?"
"and dougie would say, just a minute."
and he'd look up a book.
and it was with writing in it his dougie's writing in it.
er oh aye.
aye we better have two coaches extra like.
three there'd be five you see.
"and i wondered how he deduced you know, how he got this."
and i learned after a few weeks that how he got this was there was no weather forecast as we know them now you know on the television.
"but it'd been a good day last year, on the monday holiday, and they had needed two coaches you see."
so he was taking it for granted or or chancing his hand that this monday for this year was going to be another good day.
you see.
so he'd put two on.
"if it was only one for the liverpool you know, one extra for the liverpool, you see, it'd be the same this year."
what an antiquated way of working.
you know.
but anyway it seemed to work so.
and that's how they they got their.
"were there a lot of these er particularly amongst the older men and the and the inspectors and that that kind of thing, were there a and you've talked about , a lot of the old ideas were still."
aye.
persistent.
did you find that  so many it took a long time for change to take place.
oh aye.
aye.
"you see at every station, every depot, on british rail, there were always one man thrown up as being  the one who knew everything."
you see.
the leader.
everybody looked to this person for guidance see.
"and that in itself was a form of antiquity you know, it it it is it went back to the old days you see."
"and it was laughable you know, at times."
"when you asked phoned up say from  from the yard at  street, and asked an inspector, the shift er the man on the shift, er what about er tomorrow?"
saturday.
do you not think we'll need another extra coach on the the manchester?
or something like that.
"oh er aye jimmy, well, i'll tell you, i'll see dougie when he comes out."
"you see,."
and i'll let you know.
"that was the style of it, they couldn't see, couldn't make up their own mind."
"they were afraid to but if they'd had that if they'd told me to provide an extra coach for the manchester as i was suggesting, dougie would have come out and taken strips off them for you see."
it was a queer queer thing but that's what happened.
"that's what happened, not only at   street but other places ."
but more so at the ex-callie.
"with the ex-callie, they took longer to adapt to nationalization i think, than the rest of the railway."
however er i got quite friendly with a signalman at er  street.
the signal box was just up er where i was stationed you see.
and er there were some great characters among the signalmen.
but they too were er in their way.
"they were old men , getting old men you know, at the sixty mark."
"and er oh no, this is how we do it here, no."
no.
but er if i would suggest but if you're er letting that train out first you see and .
ah no no no.
we don't want to upset the working and .
"they wouldn't if you suggest anything you suggested anything to expedite the working,you're wasting your time, wasting your breath."
they would go on their own merry way you see.
"because that's how they'd done it twenty years ago, and that's how they're going to do it till they retire."
"so it were no good fighting against them i mean they i used to let them please theirself you know, and er  just because they were quite happy to go along that way."
"i was gonna ask you that, you you moved into er more a a more supervisory capacity when you."
aye.
moved into the foreman and inspector jobs.
"er what sort of relationship did you have with with the men, did you er particularly thinking that you you were still for a long time after that, the the branch secretary of the union you know ."
aye.
how did that square up?
"aye well,there was i wasn't aware of any what you'd call transition."
"you know, from the wages grade to the supervisory grade you see."
i wasn't aware of that.
"that said, i got to know my men my staff and everybody has their peculiarities you know, the different thingummies."
and i put myself out to find out what they liked best.
and what they liked their job how how they liked their job.
and what part of their jobs they liked best you see.
"and it was surprising how they responded, and i used to cater for their their whims and wishes you know."
they were doing what they were expected to do you see.
"but ,say we had two shunters, i had two shunters."
"one liked coupling up coaches you see, and then the vestibules, the canvas vestibules joining the coaches together for passengers to walk through."
see.
"one of them i found, loved he was an expert as he said at coupling vestibules."
see.
and the other one thought he was good at the buckeye coupling.
you see.
he knew all about it.
"because i had taught him about it you know, from coming from ."
"and i would say to him, look joe, you know what to do with the buckeyes, i say, you go across to the yard and get them ready, set them you see."
"and you,, you're good at the vestibules, the canvas vestibules you know, concertinas like."
"i says, you get them coupled up and i can rely on you to get them right you see."
well that's how i i played my shunters.
now  i found that i got results that way.
"and i could rely on them because they were good at that job you see, particular job."
and i used to tell them they were good at it.
and that satisfied them and it satisfied me.
and i got on swimmingly with them.
"the same with the signalmen, i would go the signalman and tell him, well  on the other shift you know, they would have left that train away first, before they left that other one in you see."
ah but  no not on my shift.
my shift we do it this way.
you see.
"and you got to know all these things, you got to know the peculiarities of what they liked best doing you see, and everything like that."
so that was my way of of working with the staff.
i didn't oppose them in any way you see.
i was getting the best them.
"because, what they were doing was their best."
you see.
and that satisfied me.
they were never never any hassle.
on my shift you know.
and i just don't know .
do you think it was important that er or do you think your experience coming though the  was important?
oh invaluable.
that was aye.
"you see, coming right up from coal boy and lamp-man you know, porter, signalman and parcel porter, leaving parcel porter, yard foreman and then shunter, guard foreman."
"i mean it was invaluable, you were learning everything there was to to know, you know."
"it was i was gonna ask you you know,when you moved from shunter to foreman, you had responsibilities for a lot a lot besides the shunting."
mm.
"but as you as you're describing there, coming through the grades,."
yeah.
you'd already had some some former knowledge of all the other aspects of the railway in any case.
aye.
"you see, when i became yard inspector, the staff soon got to know that they couldn't kid me, they couldn't kid me you see."
"because i knew their job, i'd done their job you see."
"each one of their jobs i'd done except the carriage cleaning , but that was a straightforward job, cleaning carriages."
but  shunters and all the rest  i'd done their job.
i'd come up the hard way you see.
and i knew the tricks of the trade.
so there were no good in the fighting against me.
you see.
i could tell at a glance whether the job was done or not.
in fact i could hear the click of the buckeye coupling.
and the ring the bell you see.
"and i would say, i'd maybe be about twenty or thirty yards the coach, and i'd say to the shunter when he come out, that buckeye's not caught."
you'd better go back and uncouple the  and split it again and set the buckeye.
the jaw's open .
i could even tell thirty thirty or forty yards away just by the ring see.
if it was caught.
"if if it hadn't caught, it was a dull sound you see, a thud."
"whereas if it caught, there were a  cling  a ring you see."
"so these wee things i i knew and er  my staff soon found you see that well they just had to go along and do the job as it should be done, you see, and they were no good at kidding me that it had been done, for i used to examine everything that was done you see."
"if i gave them an order to couple up a full line of maybe ten coaches, i wouldn't take it for granted that they'd done it, i'd walk up the coach, one walk up one side, down the other side and i wouldn't if there were a heating valve not open, if they forgot that you see, i wouldn't do it for them, i would go back and i'd say, that s k third from the back end, the heating valve is not pulled down, you've missed it, you'd better when you're up that way, just pull it down you see."
"so that was if i'd done it you see, that was spoiling them."
so it was the likes of that and these things that got me to know my staff and got my staff to know me.
and there were no.
building a relationship with your.
"building a relationship, that's right."
"and there were never any cause for arguments or never any rows or arguments and that, and no shouting and bullying and er no that started at er at er  street as a yard inspector."
and er well i was there for eighteen month as a yard inspector.
"and i enjoyed it, it was quite good, i got on well with the staff."
and er then there was a vacancy that was a class three inspector's job at yard inspector's job at  street.
so the the inspectors were actually graded .
graded.
"they were er a grade five, that was the lowest inspector, grade four but eventually the grade er five and four were done away with."
"but anyway, that was a grade three i was in."
and there was a grade three carriage cleaning inspector advertised for .
"so i thought i'd put in for that, it was a lateral move you know, but still it was getting back to my depot and nearer my home."
so i put in for that and i got that.
"and er well the carriage cleaning well a carriage cleaning inspector you just, looked after the carriage cleaners and seen that the coaches were right you know and walk along the  and examine the coaches after they'd been cleaned you see."
"and if they weren't properly done, you'd  tell the forewoman that that wasn't in such and such a coach in compartment was needing under the seats were needing cleaning ."
"she would tear into her staff you see and get it and then er along the corridors you know, there's ledges up above the doors as they slide into each compartment."
"and i used to go a well a finger you see and, that's not been dusted you see."
and er just tell the forewoman .
that was it.
but you were responsible.
"you see, when the trains arrive from  at waverley, and heard that er one superintendent and gerald  was his name, he was a great boy for going down to waverley to meet trains coming from ."
"maybe once a month at that you know, and occasionally just to catch, to see if the trains were properly cleaned you see."
"and he used to take his white handkerchief out, and go along the corridors and above these, up on these ledges, with his white hanky."
imagine imagine a white hanky.
and go it.
"and if it was dirty, he would go back to his office and phone  and phone the yard master and say, so and so coach  dirty."
i've been i've been intending to ask you actually about the about the women workers.
er you you've mentioned them off and on quite a few times er that there.
mm.
that it was predominantly women that were in the carriage cleaners.
yes.
er how did you find them as workers in there weren't many women at that time er in.
well.
a a manual working environment if you like.
"at  aye and even at , there was one woman them."
there was a woman the women workers.
they called her a forewoman you see.
"and most of the forewomen see there were one on each shift, three shifts and then there were a middle shift, a nine to five shift that was four forewomen."
now the carriage cleaning inspector  had a good job if he went about it the proper way.
"now i never if i was going through a train or going down a platform, and there were two or three carriage women carriage cleaners you know,i wouldn't speak to them about their work."
"i'd maybe have a chat chat with them you know, personal like."
but i wouldn't talk to them about their work.
i went to the forewoman you see.
"and i told her what was wrong or what wasn't right you see, and what what was wanted what i wanted done you see."
"and that put her in her place you see, and it gave her a position."
"and she in in turn, she could get tore into the women if they missed anything, see."
"not me, that wasn't my job i thought."
"my job, my contact was the forewoman, you see."
"so therefore there were never any hassle or or arguments and the forewoman got her place, i gave her a place you see."
and she in turn supervised her her own women staff you see.
so it was as simple as that.
is er the fact that carriage cleaning was probably considered a low grade i think you'd have felt it was.
aye aye.
"was there any feeling amongst the men that er it was not only a low grade, but it was done by women if you if you like?"
"no you see, the women cleaners done the interior of the coaches, and the male carriage cleaners did the exterior, the brushed you see."
with the x mover that's what they called the solution.
"they just put it on you see with a brush and it was a paste you see, all over the coach,and then they had a hose and they washed all that x mover off you see, the x mover was an acid and it ate into the you see, bodywork."
"and they so that was the men's job, was the exterior of the coaches."
and the woman done the interior.
"so there were all there were a distinction you see, between men and that."
"that's what i'm getting at you know, what."
aye.
"was the relationship like between the men and women, er the men and women cleaners even?"
ah there were no no bother with them.
"there were no bother, they just they were a men er a a male carriage cleaner and the women were women."
that's not my job .
they knew their jobs you see.
"that's a man's job, the woman would say."
"and the men would say, oh that's not my job, that's your job."
so there were a distinction in that respect and there were never any trouble.
and there were never any fights that i had that i can remember between men and women or anything like that.
there were squabbles and shouts and screams with women tearing you know.
tearing 's hair but the forewoman would come on the scene and she would settle it.
when my mother was young she was  down there.
"and she gave the school, no she gave them  did that much, that they brought for here school books, and she finished her education in ."
"and if i mind right i think it was some kind of relational  that used to e in the bank, that was a teacher there."
and then she they they lived in stummerslake she was born in greamsee.
what size of a school would there have been in.
"oh it would have been half as small, and she used to tell us grand stories with them setting off in the morning with their a bottle of milk and their , it's like a with them, to keep the fire going to keep them warm and everything."
oh what grand stories she did tell.
and what was it like as a small bairn  pharay then?
"well she thoroughly enjoyed the life, in fact right up, oh till nearly the end she spoke about pharay and she was able she used to go and she imagined she could see it better with the spy glasses."
"she loved pharay, she loved the country she loved the people."
"and they were half a good  smile, and  they did not  tell  who's ninety two."
mhm.
and what was it like for for a bairn on on pharay?
oh i think that the  well more or less kind of like what it'll be when we were young.
"they made their own amusements, and she learnt to knit and they had long winter nights round the fire and they used to go she used to call it, we used to go after day set, that she called evening."
"and they'd visit and take their knitting with them and sit and yarn, and that was all the enjoyment."
i don't never heard her speaking very much about games.
but oh she was perfectly happy there.
how many were at the school?
i don't ken.
it wouldn't have be so  a great number.
how big is pharay?
"oh god, i don't ken."
i have no idea.
it's not that big.
would there have been maybe about how many houses?
"maybe about a dozen houses, i don't ken."
"i have visited the house that my mother stayed at, er called the north house aye, it was just a pretty bit of a but and beam."
what did the folk do?
"well they crofted in small way i suppose, and went the fishing."
"and they had what they called a floating shop, you know just a bit of  a a boat that came, oh i think it was once a week, and they used to go and get supplies it."
aha.
"oh no, she loved the life in pharay."
mhm.
and you've always lived in stromness?
all my days and hope i finish it here.
all me days.
can't understand what families want to go away .
what was stromness like when you small?
oh it was super.
"it was quiet, but there was different things that amused us that the bairns would just laugh at today, i mean, there was no pictures or things like that."
"that we'd go to the shore, and we'd spend a whole day there, no lemonade and biscuits then."
"a bottle of water or a pale of water and maybe maybe  biscuits, i don't ken, and we had  different games, and there was a a game."
like those certain games that you played at certain seasons of the year.
"like maybe now about this time of the year we would start with skipping, and then in the winter time, we well there was has a lot of , we would just seem to amuse ourselves."
we  peedie concerts and things like that.
and oh me mother was  good.
"she would read  and everything else, and there was nine of us children  had that much time, but we had a very happy childhood in lots of ways."
"they did not have electricity, it would be oil lamps and some of them i cannot mind when gas would come."
"but it would be old lamps and peedie bits of  and when you speak about long ago times i associate the smell of paraffin and sawdust and cooking apples and all that you go into peedie shops and there was a fine relationship, you go in and well i used to be  for the old folk and they were all awful good to me, and the  particular and we used to go every saturday night to a shop called blacks and it stayed open till nine o'clock."
"but there was oh what to me seemed, in that days, to be oh awful grand shops for baking and what not."
folk would not look at it nowadays.
been a kind of  peedie that's industrious and what not.
"and it was basically long ago in the well in me mother's day, there was the herring fishing, it was a busy time then."
was your mother involved in that?
well not in the herring fishing but er there was also a a salt fish kind of processing place out in the hens and me mother work at it and she used to tell us about i supposed they'll be not rubber boats in that days.
"or the protective  that we have now, and they would have sometimes have to weigh the whole ."
"and send a whole day with , and it never hurt them."
"and then in the herring fishing time, oh it was very busy right enough, and you see they did they did no fish on a sunday and they would come in on a saturday night."
"and me mother used to say you could you could have walked from the point of ness, to the pier, how were the boats were that tightly packed in."
and i remember herring fishing in me young days.
"it was the it was  boats in me mother's day, then the drafters was ."
"anyhow it was like the sea and boats and everything else and i used to i was working in a shop and i use to get up early in the morning and go down and tally all the numbers and names of the boats and  and there was an old man came in to shop while i was working in and asked about a certain boat, i says oh i can tell you,trek down ."
and i give him the whole book what lists names and numbers and what not.
and i got a great big box of chocolates of him.
"oh well i always loved the sea, i don't think i could live without seeing the sea."
you said your mother could walk across?
"well when the tide was low, they would walk for the outer homes, then their hens and back again."
"and sometimes it would be a good  of water you see, and they would get their feet wet."
you can still walk across it low tide.
i've done it myself when i was young.
what kind of a job did you do then?
what what white fish was it?
"it would be cod and ling and maybe haddock, i don't ken."
just what salt fish you had.
and who was processing them?
"well if i mind right, i think my mother used to speak about man,, that had this fish curing station over at the hens."
and did he employ fisherman to fish for him?
"maybe the local fisherman did, where he got the fish i could not say."
or it might have been a bigger concern than i ken.
and maybe he had other outside boats took fish to them too.
but me old mother certainly spoke a lot about this  and the and the salt fish.
how did they cure them?
what what kind of a job was it?
they would salt them down and let them lie in the brine for a while and they would take them out and dry them.
"what way they dried them, whether it was in the sun or if they'd anything to dry them with, i don't ken."
but they made a great thing with the salt fish.
it must have been awful bad in the hens.
mhm.
i don't think.
they would have  rubber gloves or any in that days.
"it was the same with the herring gutters that was here, i mind them working on the pier down here, and they all had their fingers tied up with clotes there was  the skill that work in this."
where did all the rest come from?
"oh well they the north east a lot of them, if they all  oh my they would not do it nowadays."
no.
in all weathers the poor critters would be standing parking and what not.
for very little money.
what sort of hours did they have?
"they would start in the morning er i would say maybe eight o'clock, i dunno maybe sooner."
and they'd still be working well on after what we call tea time.
"and what about your mother, when she worked at the the white fish station?"
well i think she'd go off early in the morning and then would come home about teatime.
they'd take a piece with them and that was all they had to sustain them the whole day.
oh it was hard hard times.
it's a wonder that they were as fit as they were.
i would only been six or seven when the war started.
it started in nineteen fourteen.
first i mind about it was the first zeppelin that came over.
great big thing like a huge balloon and lived out at ness and i mind me mother coming and getting us early and this great big thing come over.
who was in it?
why it be germans.
what were they doing?
reconnoitring about the fleet likely.
that was the bigger threat the big thing that brought them to orkney.
it was not i suppose for anything the flow that they came up as far as orkney.
do you remember the british warships being in the flow in the first  ?
oh yes.
"when they would come in there would be like a  all lit up, beacon."
what were the bairns told at school about the war?
oh oh i suppose we were told about the war but being young and heedless we would not take it all in.
i was ten when we could .
"and all i ken was that we got word that there was to be a school trip and that we were leaving i forget what tie in the morning, and going down to see the german ships."
did you know about the fact that they'd been captured?
"no, i did not realize it."
"and i was only one out the family of nine that volunteered to go and none of me brothers or none of them that was all keen on the sea, they did not seem to want to go."
and i went.
"i dunno it was arranged but it was a a small water boat that took us down, the flying kestrel."
oh we left and oh we were all excited about going on what  a great big boat and it was in fact only a small water boat.
and we were all enjoying it and looking forward to going to see this big ships and whatnot.
"sailing along quite the thing and we were right down i dunno how far, if we were right in the middle of them or just on the edge of them, but we were not far from them."
"when there was a sense of unrest and what not, and then first one ship then the other, starts shuddering but before that happened we saw germans coming off in the rafts and that."
some of them swimming in the sea and whatnot.
i was terrified.
and then the the ships shuddered and  and some would go down by the stern and others would topple up and they'd be great fountains of water.
by his time i was terrified and i don't ever be so  and our teacher took us down below and tried to play games  my mind i distinctly howling my .
"and eventually we got they were frightened you see, that the suction of the boats going down would pull the the water boat under."
so we turned and came back and oh it was grand.
we got a grand welcome home.
did nobody have any idea what was going on at the time?
i don't suppose no they wouldn't have any warning about this going to happen or they would never have taking a lot of bairns down among it.
it was just very spontaneous surely.
"but they had it very well arranged, the germans did."
"but there was a big loss of life , but what frightened me was this germans coming over on peedie bits of rafts and the men swimming in the sea and whatnot."
were you frightened because it was germans?
yes.
i was terrified of the germans.
well what did you think they were going to do?
well i had no idea.
maybe come and kill us or something  like that.
i did not ken .
i was just terrified out me wits.
when  our people what was going on and one thing and another.
but i as i say i were young and i wouldn't have been paying particular attention.
but oh we were told about the war and what was happening between the germans and whatnot.
and did you think that the germans were were bad or?
oh yes very bad.
well there was lots of families you see that had their boys and men and sweethearts and all at the front it was a sad time.
"people that you knew, you know, getting wires and that to say that their menfolk had either been killed or were missing or some like that."
that sticks out in my mind.
but our family was too young to me in the war like me brother.
in.
what i mind of the last war it was too busy then.
very very hectic.
i forget how many troops were here.
"but we lived near a battery, we lived out at whale park and when they they deciding give the  elizabeth was just a baby then and i used to grab elizabeth and go in the bed and  the down quilt and the pillows us and lie tight and send you until the  was in the sitting room and the search light follow the plane was at the plane was that near the house that the searchlight come right into the window, and the next i ken was the bullets ricocheting off the roof."
where did the bullets come?
the german plane that the searchlight was following.
it was a german plane coming over.
"and the searchlights the the battery that we were the camp that we were near, they opened fire and the  battery would open fire at that, and the searchlight anyway came in through the window."
it was not a very fine experience.
were there a lot of air raids at that time?
oh well there was quite a lot of warnings and whatnot but er on the whole there was a lot but no more than any other place.
but oh it was busy busy then.
where did all the troops stay?
"there was some of them billeted in private houses, and we just had a two bedroom house out at whale park a peedie bungalow."
"and you were if you had a spare room you were all well i think you were forced to take in troops and we had elizabeth, a baby, and we had lodgers, nearly all the wartime."
"we kept two at a time, sometimes one and not what not."
"and then there was the  were staying our, the stromness  and the commercial  and and that."
"and the distillery and then, , there was camps at the belt."
what about amusements?
well speaking personally i had plenty of amusement butt here was pictures and there was mess dos and parties and  what not.
oh it was a gay life.
"just before when my father and mother when they were courting before they they got married to with, yeah?"
"yes fine, okay."
right.
off you go then.
well my father was a farmer working at home with his mother who was a widow in .
"and my mother, she was a dress maker or an apprentice dressmaker if that is the correct term."
"and er they were courting and er my grandmother she was renting the the park front they called it in , plas , in  where the agricultural college is now."
er  were the name of the gentry who were living in in in the place.
"and erm my father and another lad who was working out in the  had to go  called michael, had to go down every evening to pump water for the the animal."
"there was no running water in the fields, only a shaft with a pump."
then they had to go and pump water for the stock.
"and the ambition of all the farm lads then was to get on good terms with the maids in in the plas because after the gentry, they'd had their dinner, the maids could invite whoever they liked into the cellar and saloon for supper."
and erm my father and michael had got to know the maids in in the plas but michael had grabbed the the the the good looking of the parlour maid and my father had to make do with the cook.
"and well, it's not nice to say that a girl is fat these days, but she was all ample proportioned we'll put it like that."
and she was called tiny.
but it wasn't to be the for the friendship with tiny that my father got to have the rattling good supper that that they provided in in in the servants room.
"and he'd be there once or twice and then on the wednesday evening as was his custom, he went down to  to the village, he had a date with my mother and there she was standing by the shop in the square and when she saw him coming down she turned and said,, she said and swirled her skirts round."
"go back to your tiny, she said, and off she went home."
well my father wasn't giving in so easy.
"and then walking home from the chapel on sunday night with my mother, he started walking home with her father."
"my grandfather, thomas , he was a a carpenter."
"and the  were they lived, it was on a a bit of a rise about the square in  and he was a very keen gardener."
his curtain could be seen from the square and it was something worth looking at.
and that was his pride and joy.
"and then my father became a very keen gardener and asking thomas , how do you do this and how do you do that?"
"well my boy, said the old man, it would be easier if you were to come over you see, for me to show you, than try to tell you here."
"so my father went over on the monday evening and after such a a young man paid such interest in the garden and paying so much compliments, well you can't go home without coming in for a cup of tea."
and that is  how he he he got on good terms with my mother again.
in .
and he went duly they got married and very fortunately there was a little  of twelve acres just in the bottom of the field adjoining .
called .
and the that is where they started their married life.
my father working at home with his mother and farming this twelve acre holding and my grandmother erm sub-letted the the park  for him.
he was doing a bit of dealing .
we'll have a chat about the old dealers later.
doing a bit of dealing and er keeping the stock he was buying and selling in this twelve acre park in .
well it was quite a change for my mother from being a dressmaker to being a a well a smallholder's wife.
"she had no idea about milking or anything, but she very very soon got used to it."
"erm but the most unfortunate thing that old edward  the the old chap who owned the place he was living in part of the house and old jane , his housekeeper, my mother she could bake bread and wash, her mother had taught her that, but it was making butter that was the problem."
"and old jane  said, don't you worry my girl, er i'll make the butter for you."
"and my mother, they were keeping six cows there after churning, old jane  made the butter and er taking it to  to erm mrs  from  who used to buy my grandmother's butter my my mother took her stock on the thursday to market."
"but the following thursday mrs  said, well i'm very sorry my dear, i can't accept your butter because last week's lot didn't keep."
old jane  hadn't take enough trouble to make it proper and wash all the buttermilk out.
and it had gone bad.
ah.
my mother she cried oh she did  she cried all night.
after going to bed that night.
she was so insulted you know.
a young farmer's wife having her first batch of butter er rejected.
"and erm she was determined that she would have a go her own, the following week."
"and the following wednesday, she just didn't know how to tell the old lady but it's odd how fate takes a hand occasionally."
"the old lady was er opening the the the not a  just what we call the chamber, er the the downstairs bedroom."
"opening the window, and somehow or other, the the sash it fell back, caught both her hands and jammed her finger."
and there she was crying and shouting in there.
well my mother was very very sorry that the old lady had hurt her fingers but on the other hand she was very very pleased that she couldn't make the butter.
"and from then on, er there was never a hitch , my mother was considered to be one of the best butter maker in the vicinity."
"and as i had told you before on the previous er chat we had, how my father took over er  when when i was two years old we moved up."
his mother gave up farming and he took things over.
"and for the first five years of my life, i just led a very lonely life with only the my grandmother and my parents and the farm men."
"and  i was the  and my grandmother, they had got me hooked on horses then."
not realizing that they were preaching about the glory that been.
and i would be always be with john  in the stable and i got until i got into er some danger walking er underneath a horses legs and he'd he'd send me out banned me from the stable and shut the door.
"then for a day or so, i would be the cow man's mate."
when i was with the cattle i always wore my the cap on the side of my head.
that was way the sign of a carter wearing his cap right on the side of his over his ear.
was it?
but the cow man he wore his cap with the peak over er er the back of his head.
"back to front, cos he'd be carrying a lot of  of hay on his back and that was to stop the hay seed, going down between it shirt and his skin."
and then i'd be wearing my cap back to front for a day or so.
"working with with the with the cow man, but i very soon got tired, i'd be begging to be allowed back into the stable because the horses were my first love."
"well when i was about five, one morning, my father fixed a cushion over the back bone of the bike."
that was the way we travelled then.
practically nobody had a car in  at the time.
and then er tie a cushion over the back bone of the bike and have me sitting er on on this cushion on the bike him.
"he had we started out somewhere i had no idea where we were going, until we arrived at this big building with a high railing surrounding the yard and a crowd of children shouting and playing in the yard."
it was then that i realized that he was going to leave me on my own.
in this building.
and i had never been home because er too far from the village.
i had never had been playing with other children.
and when i realized this i started kicking and crying.
"and he said, well what would you prefer, go to school quietly or come with me over the hedge to have a spanking."
"well both are awkward, i said, but i will stand a light spanking if i can come home with you after."
"but then, miss  the i learned later she was the infant's teacher, one of the the kindest, noblest er teachers imaginable, she came out."
"er never you mind the children, she said, you go home, i'll take charge of him."
and she got hold of me in her arms and carried me kicking and screaming into the school.
"and i was very upset for the first day, then i started settling down."
"but then miss  see couldn't move my sight, she was the only friend i had amongst all these strangers."
and i wouldn't leave her side.
"and one day she said, now then john i want to go to the other school to mr , the schoolmaster to get a book."
don't you move from your seat.
and she got about half a dozen of the strongest boys from standard one to stand guard at the door.
"but she was out i dashed like a bulldozer through these other boys and dashed out into the bottom of the yard where there was a a certain little building in the bottom of the yard, and i opened the door, and there was miss  sitting on the throne."
"i said to her, ah i thought that you were going  why did you lie to me saying that you were going to get a book."
but eventually i settled down.
erm to to the work  and i kept er going you know like i i didn't dodge i didn't miss school.
and i suppose i was an average sort of of of pupil.
as we the time went on.
"and when i went over to standard two,miss  was the name of the teacher with the the middle classes."
and she had a custom she we had to have a book called observation book.
"none of us had any idea what observation meant, but we had to write down a sentence or something we had noticed on our way to school."
which was a very good thing and what children of today miss when they're being whisked on a bus to school.
they have no chance to notice or see anything erm and make them observant and looking out for things.
"in the spring when the the daffodils and and the snowdrops started coming, and then there'd be bird's nests and all the different flowers, the farmers would start sowing, cultivating, mares would have foals, they had the harvest."
there were any amount of things you could write about in summer.
"but in the depth of winter say, er from november after christmas, there were very very few things you could notice and erm goodness knows how many times i fell back on  he was one of the last persons to be churning with horsepower."
"you know, a horse turning round and round in in what they called a horse power."
a long pole and it worked a lot of cog wheels and the shaft going through to the dairy to turn the churn.
"and er i had to fall back very often just write, i saw mr  follow the horse in in in that that churning power."
i had to fall back on that many time.
and erm oh the games we used to have.
whatever was going on in the village at the time when say the threshing machine was going round.
we played at threshing and er shifting the thresher from farm to farm we had been watching with horses then.
and the the way was to get the heaviest boy he would the be the the threshing machine machine.
and the second boy would be the the shaft horse and the  other children catching hold of 's jerseys pulling.
and we had seen the horses er er struggling and kicking strange horses.
"and then that would happen and very often i've seen the the the the shaft horse having kicked the thresher in his leg, had the two fighting."
breaking the whole thing up.
"and then we used to be playing top, we'd  a top right round the village, see how far we could go."
"and then playing a a hook, bowling a hook with a sort of a long hook to an iron hoop or hook it would about two foot six in circumference."
and see how far you go with that.
and then we'd be playing marbles.
the yard then it wasn't tar  just a loose surface.
"then we're twist a hole with the heel of our boots, and everybody trying to get their marbles into this hole and then whatever, if you could get your you whatever you won you could keep."
"and er there would be a an eisteddfod, a competitive meeting."
in in the village and then we used to have that  at dinnertime.
there were no school dinners then .
"all the children who were living far away, they brought a sandwich and a flask with them and eating in the desk in the classroom."
"and we'd have this competitive meeting and there would be a chairing ceremony erm and it's amazing the the tidy little poems that er some of the children made then you know, children under fourteen."
some of them were earthy wouldn't be very proper for me to repeat here.
"and they wouldn't sound the same er in english, they were welsh poems ."
but it's amazing then we'd have a .
where one lot would be the hare he'd start about ten minutes before.
this was during the the dinner hour.
and all the rest of use would be hounds chasing after him.
and maybe we'd be oh a long distance the school when we heard the schoolmaster blowing the whistle.
and we'd be pouting away and arriving about five minutes past one and then  we'd be in for trouble then .
because we were late for the afternoon lessons.
"erm i don't know if i told you before, i hated any sort of games."
no ball games or what we called drill which was erm p t you call it now.
"but i had been er made a i think i told you this before, a monitor and i used to dodge all these sort of things and erm i used to go after i'd been putting the books out for the next lesson, i could go to the library  and i used to sit down and read."
"and i think that is why er er  i acquired my taste for it, still i read a lot."
and that was the way it went until i was eleven.
and then there was a scholarship class then.
you had to go sit  scholarship to go to the county school we they called it.
and this was the the school master had a special class and he used to keep us in after school to have extra lessons.
"but i just didn't want to go, it was  to my grandmother and old john  they used to say, oh no, you don't want to school, you're supposed to stay here at home."
working with your father.
my mother was the only one was keen for me to have some sort of education.
"but on the morning saturday morning when the exam was being er sat in the county school in  i was very very ill, too ill to get about eleven o'clock when it was too late."
and then i missed my chance and then i had only had the little primary school in  until i was fourteen.
and well that's about the the erm well a rough story of my school days i think.
i was average with my lessons.
"and not the worst and not the best, average."
but the i offended the schoolmaster very much not sitting this exam because erm his record depended upon how many pupils he could get to pass this exam.
and if he wanted a promotion to go to a better school.
erm the inspectors used to come round and it was the number of pupils he managed to get into the county school that added a lot of points to his record.
"and then he was very er well now i'm sorry after he'd put all the hard work with me, he was very very annoyed and disappointed that i had let him down so."
but we got over it and i finished my school at fourteen and came back to work at home.
at .
how did you how your mother er come to terms with the idea that you weren't going to go to the county school?
she was very very disappointed.
but there was nothing she could do about it then and it was too late.
"but she made certain that my sister who was six years younger, she made certain that she went to the county school."
she became a teacher later on.
and erm my my mother my father was neutral about the whole thing.
he didn't didn't take side one one way or another.
he was neutral.
but my mother was very keen and she was very disappointed because i had missed out.
"i suppose if i had gone to school, my life would be completely changed."
but i have no regrets.
"i  left  led i would say an uneventful life, but i've been very happy  you know, ups and downs."
never very rich.
and no great heights and no great depths either.
depths either.
just a a medium eventful life.
i have no regrets really.
nothing nothing to worry about i was i was happy leading my own erm quiet little life you know.
and that is how i have got along for the last sixty six years.
when you became the.
the  yes at home.
"doing all the odd chores, helping a lot."
"and the women in the house, peeling potatoes, getting the coal, carrying water."
erm i used to carry a lot especially in in summer.
erm carry all the water from a shaft in the bottom of the field for all the the animals in in into the and all the pigs and the calves.
"and er when i was well before i was fourteen, and i believe that is why i stoop so much now."
my my young bones they've been pulled down with carrying these er er all these pails of water.
how far did you how far away?
"well, down the bottom of the field you know, it was a a fairly big field."
and there was a a path which had been trodden back and forth down to to this er shaft with a pump on it.
we had to carry in in winter we had the rainwater off the roofs which filled two brick cisterns for the livestock.
but in summer those were dry we had to carry all the water then.
"when the men were out working in the field, i was left in the yard erm i helped with feeding the milking the cows, feeding the calves and the pigs."
and helping the my mother.
"when i left school, my mother didn't have a maid in the house shortly after that."
i was doing the most of the peeling potatoes and getting the coal and the firewood.
"and laying the table, washing up the dishes."
and churning and the carrying water for er for to for for the household and needed a lot of water when you were churning to to wash the the butter properly.
"and when my mother was baking in a huge ovenware basin, then she'd have the the erm the flour and the the erm what do you call it that made it rise?"
yeast?
the yeast yes that's the word.
and then she put had some warm water and er she had to have it to the proper consistency and then she'd have a a bucket of water standing by her side with a a jug.
"and once she'd had the her arms in the dough, i had to stand by her side just to feed a drop of water gently."
"and i remember the first time, i poured a whole jugful of  water in."
without realizing i was lucky that her hands were stuck in the dough  she she would have given me a thick ear you know for for for doing that .
and er anyway later on i used to er go out into the fields with the men.
oh another job that the .
the men would be working out in the fields in the summer.
then they used to have their  which was a cup of tea at ten in the morning and then having their tea at four.
out in the fields.
and that was part of my work.
a big erm pitcher full of tea and then a basket tied on my back with the sandwiches and and the cake of scone my mother used to back more often.
and another basket in my hand with with the cups.
"and i used to to carry out their meals to the men, and they used to be eating out in the field then."
"and the dogs would be sitting, staring up in their faces."
they used to throw an odd crust to to the dogs.
and er that was the way.
that was my my life.
until later on.
i became a horseman myself.
and we had another .
when did a person or when did you stop being stop being a ?
well when i was about sixteen say.
and then that was  when i were big enough  in in in the hay and the corn harvest to er  be the carts.
"be able to make a load and strong enough to pitch it into the stack, that was the problem."
"and making a load of hay especially, you had to work it, roll every pitchfork you had, roll it and set it properly you knew as you  now then you must have numbers on them so you know how to unravel that lot."
every erm pitchfork must come out one you can't start fighting and and pulling it against the grain otherwise you you would be in trouble.
so every pitchfork used to come out er one after another you had numbers on them you know.
came out in layers.
"as it wasn't so heavy but that was an art, making the load."
"so that's  and you said, if you erm don't er sweat a little in making the load, you will sweat a tremendous amount when you were busy pitching it into the into the stack."
so was that  was that considered to be particularly skilful then?
"oh it was it was yes, some people were considered to be very very good at building a load."
"they said it was like a box you know, and they could tremendous heights, putting i don't know how many layers."
"when we first started, erm erm only a tiny amount just er an untidy lump on the centre."
er of the there were there was a a frame which stretched out the carts.
bigger on the you know the the  .
"and then when you came into the stockyard with a  caw, caw,like a a crow saying it was just something like a crow's nest."
just an untidy lump.
that was how they used to insult someone who had a  and untidy load you know.
and er that hurt and that made you much more determined to improve and be able to make a proper load as quickly as possible.
"at this time,would you be having help from other farms?"
"yes, yes and you used to do a lot of sharing er u farms helping ."
that was quite common in those days.
er well common.
would people go their way to seek to find someone who was particularly skilled  and with building a load and did they take.
well you couldn't er the men were hired on the farms for for a term of six months you know.
yeah.
and some of those well like in every other trade were better than others.
erm the erm the erm periodical men who used to come over harvest  their job was to pitch it up in the field.
"er they they didn't go out with the cart, just with a regular who used to go out with the with the horses and carts."
"then you had a a spare man what you sent over the harvest, which you hired for a a month of occasionally they only used to come by the day."
there were some er farms say of fifteen or twenty acres which wasn't quite big enough to make a living.
"and then these other men they used to be a freelance, working a day here and a week there."
they used to do what little chores they had in the morning and then again after  their wives did most of it.
and then they did the the heavy work erm in the in the morning and in the evening.
and they those were  like er a we called them freemen.
and not hired in one farm for six months.
and mostly those were er married men who had a small place of their own which wasn't quite big enough to to keep them full time.
and it was er er too big again for them to become tied in one place for for a whole six months.
were they er were they would they be treated in any different was say er er people who had their own farms would they.
no.
no.
"but er if they were just working for a single day, it was long day up till ten o'clock at night in a harvest you know."
and erm their their wages were higher.
"they they demanded a higher wage er for erm just because er a man wasn't too dear if it was a good er harvesting day, a man wasn't too dear at any price."
cos without him you couldn't get your harvest in and tomorrow it might be raining.
so nobody grumbled about paying an extra er bit for for these men.
cos it was good to have them when you were pushed when you  had a lot of of work to do.
"the regular men they were kept on or when if it was a rainy day when they couldn't go out and just do some odd jobs in the building say, when it was a a rainy day."
so it was a sort of a give and take.
"some days er they worked longer hours and harder work and there were other days which er which erm they couldn't do anything much, just potter around in the buildings."
"and erm but with a man coming in over the harvest, they were working hard and long hours every day and they demanded and they deserved a higher wage."
"was there any sort of understanding that part of the wages would be pain in food, anything like that?"
oh the food was included.
nobody er erm or it was nobody thought about it that was taken for granted.
"nowadays i hear erm or the lads who have been  they go out they've been working with contractor and they say how different it is when your mother was alive, everybody who came here they they used to join us for their dinner."
you know the the the odd men.
"but now we go around farms, nobody ever ask us if we want a cup of tea  that's gone practice now."
and er very few men live in and er nobody er think of offering them a meal.
they've got to carry their own food.
you know contractor's men.
but in those days it was nobody thought you know it was the done thing.
nobody thought of anything it was just everybody coming in for their meals.
"oh a great help to  sandwiches and a sit down meal at dinner at table with the family, it was far better than a dry sandwich eaten in the barn."
"er can you ever remember any what might be called, failed harvests or difficult harvests?"
oh yes yes.
yes.
"erm remember the hay we would be turning it with pitchforks you know, and erm not a well goo drying day but you had to risk turning it and hoping that it'd be dry but er it would be raining again the following day."
yes i've seen hay spoilt but you had to make do with it.
you couldn't do anything else.
"and i've seen the corn harvest again, the the sheaves growing green out it stook."
the the the the grain sprouting.
and the sheaves getting stuck together er sprouting and getting stuck yes.
i've seen that happen too.
"and i remember hearing a story, er erm it was just they'd got an old farmer he had a field of hay, just ready to cart and just as they were getting the horses, it came down to to rain and they were all sheltering in the barn, and the  said, more rain, more rest."
what did you say? said the old farmer.
"more rain, more grass, said the little fella."
quick thinking.
yes.
yes.
yes.
"and another job we had to do erm especially on a rainy day, ready for the worst."
"er we had no hay barn then, then you had to thatch the the stacks."
and you had to make what we called straw .
well er you could see the  one erm wooden erm turner on the winter there now.
you see that erm you you see it out the window there.
erm oh yes here it is .
"yeah, that."
then we used to have two of those.
a clamp like a.
yes.
used to have two and er had a a bit of a rope round  middle and two then there'd be two men sitting in one end of the cow shed.
you'd you'd have it fixed two of them fixed like this on a a bit of a erm er straw rope.
yes.
there were two of them.
then be backing and turning it round like that.
two of them like this.
and then there'd be two men in one end of the of a long cow shed.
they had the straw which had been er pulled out even previously.
"and then they would be feeding the straw, making these straw ropes."
two of them.
and then i as the  would be turning round and round and backing right down the cow shed and the calf pen which was oh about sixteen yards length in all.
"and then after they had reached the other end, erm one of the men would go and stand in the middle of the two and the and the other sitting down."
and we'd start i'd just turn with my right hand to join both ends of the rope and then we would be turning again.
"and the chap in sitting in the top, he'd be turning round and the other one would be walking down slowly backwards er grabbing a rope to to join the two to make it into a a double rope."
to to to put over the stacks.
ah.
"how would you start them off them,straw ?"
"jus a length of them, put it around this thing like that, and then when you started twisting, it would have a they'd be feeding more that was a quite an art again, feeding more and more straw into it you know, as i backed along."
and then  twisting it round and round.
it was an art to give just the right amount and that it wouldn't break.
"and i remember we had two men once, one used to keep his hand very very tight, squeeze it hard and the other used to make a very big, loose, untidy, whiskery sort of a rope."
"well to keep his rope tight, i had to pull on the other, and the other chap would jerk me back."
"don't pull, he said."
"then i was going slower to suit his well the other fella his rope would be dragging on the ground then you know, it was difficult to to to get the two to cooperate together."
that was a a job on a rainy day.
and then i used to the to erm coil them round.
there'd be a big pile of them ready for erm for thatching the stacks.
and then how would you do that then?
well after you know the the stack would be untidy straight after  and after it had cooled.
it used to heat so then you had to give it time to cool and settle down.
then you'd be plucking the sides to make it tidy and carrying it to make a round top sort of a roof on it.
then you would have a a thick layer of straw right along the ridge.
and then my father would be standing on on top and throwing one of these er straw ropes up then he'd let er an er end down on both sides.
"then we had a a little wooden rake, the length of the head was a yard."
"then we used to measure with that, between each rope and then, one of use each side of the stack, we'd pull hard and pull a handful of hay from the and twist it round and  this handful of hay."
"and then when he was thatching, you would start on one end and erm putting er pushing the the the the thatch into the stack."
and then you'd have a length of erm either you made little thinner straw ropes or erm what we called er  it was a sort of a coconut twine.
"erm that again had been rolled into balls and then he'd have erm about a dozen sticks which which held these balls and stuck them in then after he'd he'd erm er thatched one erm length, one row, he'd pull the string over and attach it to to the the thick er rope that was er going over the stack."
and that from one end to the other.
and then there was these these thick er straw ropes going over and then there were the other which were going sideways along the roof to hold the thatch down.
and how long would he take to thatch on of those then?
well it depended on the length.
you know a fairly long stack could take a couple of days.
and they did look really good when when they had been finished.
and erm not a drop of water would get in.
no?
no.
"it would be because the straw, the thatch had been pulled all straight it would flowing down, and then they used to er they used to throw it over, it would be throwing the water the stack had been built like an egg you know."
"bulging out from the base, bulging out and then coming back again."
you know it was shaped just like an egg.
"and then that'd be throwing all the water away, it it wouldn't soak in."
"and it was important, the way they built a stack."
they used you know in different layers.
"then they used to put a thick layer round the sides to start with, then they would fill in the middle and keep that always stronger each layer er it curved."
it would if it were were just like a trough.
"it would draw the water in but since there was much more more hay on in the inside, than the out, it er er it curved and then it wouldn't er erm absorb any water ."
"if you didn't put enough middle in it, it would sink then, then it would be drawing the water in."
oh i see .
and it would spoil.
did you.
yeah that that if there was a depression in the centre.
but after they'd put the the outer layer and then they used to tread and walk hard and tread the middle down.
did they?
so it would be hard and solid.
mm.
"and then when you were cutting it in the winter, you could see the the the layers you know."
"in a sort of a a a a half  shaped in the stack, you could see every layer, the way it had been built."
that was the art of a good stack builder again.
was there ever any danger of those catching fire?
"oh yes, it you carried it too green."
"if you carried it too green, erm i can't remember that happening to our but i've heard of some people, having to cut a shaft down into the stack you know."
we always used to push a long wire in to see how er every stack used to heat a little but er er touchwood i've never er never saw a stack heat that badly.
"but er there was a time, they got so if you had carried it too green, erm you er it could catch fire."
"and on the other hand, if you carried wet, well it would go mouldy then."
and and stink and it would be all clamped together you know.
and a lot of dust in it which was very very unhealthy.
"that was why a lot of of the old men used to get farmer's lung then, feeding this stuff in the winter."
and nobody knew anything about spores or farmer's lung or everybody are very conscious and they wear masks when they're feeding hay now.
to stop them breathing these er spores which can affect their lungs and cause farmer's lung.
was there ever any time when you just had to accept the fact that the hay would have to be carried in wet?
the.
"well erm you kept it out as long as possible but the weather spoilt it and the more you turned it, the blacker it came."
and all the goodness was being washed it.
no er eventually you would get it dry .
it was better to let it rot out on the field then go to the trouble to carry it wet because it would only rot or become mouldy and absolutely useless.
and then eventually you would get it er dry enough.
"but then when you cut that in the winter, it would be black and there wouldn't be any any any er er feed value, any sort of nourishment in it."
it had all been washed out.
"when you came in the winter, to gain access to the stack,."
yes?
how would you how would you do it ?
get at it?
yes.
"well you used to took er take one length from one er erm er straw the other, that was about a yard."
"then you had a very sharp knife, er and you used to cut down half the what we called the face of the stack, you know, half the width of it."
to start with.
then cut that into into er chunks again.
"those again would be about a yard wide and a yard deep, then you had a a big er wire with a loop on one end with a sharp point."
and they used to push this through the amount which you had cut.
and erm er grab this wire.
have one foot on a ladder or the other stack stuck into the into the into the erm face of stack and then you would struggle and work yourself underneath what we called it the trinkling.
i suppose you would call it a truss in english.
and carry it loose into the the cow shed or into the sheds for the out-wintering cattle.
or into the barn for chaffing for the horses.
always made certain that the horses had the best hay.
yes?
yes.
"the the the seeds hay, the first crop after after er a filed had been reseeded, the first crop you grew, that was reserved for the horses."
"and then the cow man would be grumbling, maybe he had some second class  hay for cattle."
"and then he'd be  grumbling, why is the the horseman getting all the best stuff."
why can't i have my my horses and my cattle you know.
well the men considered their stock as their own then.
and looked after them and er after them and took pride in to have them in the best condition.
"oh they were not the bosses' stock, they they they were their stock."
my cattle and my horses.
"and the carter used to steal a lot of oats for for the the the gaffer used to give him a ration for a week, and the granary would be locked."
and many were the tricks that the carters they used to get on the right side of the maid and get her to make an impression of the key on a block of soap.
"then he'd take it to someone who could cut er a key er so he could open the up  the granary the late in in the middle of the night, when everybody were asleep, and steal oats for the horses."
it was a it was a competition between the carters to get their horses into the best condition.
and then they used to go around on a sunday morning from farm to farm to see how the other chaps are getting on and to say how much better their horses looked.
compared to  what they had in the next farm you know .
oh they were very very keen.
keen competition.
why why was it that horses were were given pride of place over the cattle?
well the horses had to work hard.
"and er with the ploughing and the the cultivating, the sowing, the carting manure, carting  in."
"er everything the the the the work of the farm would come to a standstill if erm if the horses if they were not kept in good condition, they wouldn't be strong enough to keep on going every day."
how would er how would the the the the carter's day begin and how would it progress and how would it end?
"well he'd be getting up about oh shortly after five in the morning, to er feed his horses, muck out the stable, and groom them."
"and then he'd harness them, all except the bridle."
"and erm shortly after seven, breakfast would be served."
"he'd be in the house having his breakfast at seven so he'd be ready to take the horses out to start erm ploughing in winter, at eight."
"he'd be out most most days, ploughing."
"and on a farm when there was only one team, if they wanted to have half a day, carting , aye well the carter was very very annoyed, he didn't like that job ."
no?
"but the fairly large farm, they used to have er two teams."
"the second carter would be having well the the first carter the head carter had the best team , ploughing."
and then the second carter would be have another pair er carting er  and carting manure.
and doing all the odd jobs round the farm.
"so the actual so why was it the fetching of  etcetera, were thought of as being not so good ?"
"well erm it was a sticky you know, er a  field in winter, it was just er bare soil, there was no no grass on it and with the cart trudging back and forth, getting towards er a gateway, you would your knees in mud you know."
"erm and it was rather a a and heavy work, you had to have a team of horses to pull a load of suedes and you had to get them in some you used to to carry out on and just drag them  i mean spread them out on the field er for the store cattle and the sheep."
then you had to bring some into the yard which were put through the scrapper for the dairy cows and the young calves that were housed.
and then the the the store cattle they were in big open yards during the nights and then you used to let them out and eat these  off er a grass field in in in in in the daytime.
"and you used to pull them every four rows, making them into a row."
er  throw two and two together into the centre.
"and the ones you brought into the yard to put through the scrapper, you cut the leaves off."
of courses  otherwise that would choke the scrapper.
"but the one that were carted out on the fields, they were left with the leaves on because the cattle ate the leave ."
what exactly was the scrapper?
well er there were two they was a slicer and a scrapper.
it was a machine which you we had an oil engine in the barn.
there was the crusher for grinding the corn and the chaff cutter for chaffing the the the er hay or straw and there was the scrapper.
and it had plates inside er used to cut the the the the  into like big chips.
oh right.
"you had a these eyes on on this big plate and it was turning round and it would be er churning them up you know, cutting them into like big er chip potato chip you know really."
into these log thick chips.
and they were there was another er er slicer.
"there were two blades on that, cutting them into into round slices about oh three quarters of an inch thick."
cutting the that was for for the or the dairy cows.
and for the for the young calves you had to scrap them cos they couldn't eat the the the big big thick slices for the young calves.
how was the slicer powered then?
"oh erm with with a we had a er erm a a paraffin driven er a crossley, a big oil engine with two big flywheels to it and a big piston like a bucket."
and then you you used to have a blow lamp to heat it up and after that you you erm put it on half compression and you were turning one of the big flywheels round until it it started and you had to keep the blowlamp on it.
that there was no petrol engines then.
"and er eventually he came er an engine which er there were some which started on petrol and then you turned to paraffin but most of the work, just going on petrol, with a plug and a magneto."
you used to start that with a handle .
"but er with the the the the original the the first one, you had to heat it up with a blowlamp and you had to be very very careful to get it just to the right heat, before if you tried to start it too cold, it would kick back and if was too hot again, it just wouldn't start."
"and that was er oh it could break your arm you know, this huge big flywheel and you were taking hold of one of the of the of the spokes and turning it, if it were to backfire suddenly, it could break your arm."
"and on on the other hand, if it started and took off suddenly, it could pull you, you might fall, right on  er face into the flywheel again."
"the safety  officers of today, oh they'd have a blue fit if if they saw such things you know ."
so this this was a standing engine was it?
a standing  bit on on a big concrete base.
"and then there would be a big, what we called a big shafting, going along the the side of the barn with pulleys on it."
"and the erm the erm oil engine would be in a little shed outside the barn, and this shafting would be going through the wall."
"and there'd be two pulleys on that, what we called a loose pulley."
"and then you had a sort of a gadget what would slide the there was strap coming from the pulley of the oil engine onto there was a loose pulley and there was a gadget, you could slide the strap onto the loose pulley, then that that was only just er turning loose , then you slid it back on the fixed and it's be turning all this shafting along the barn and then there were pulley sets on that and in direct line with  crusher and chaff cutter and the scrapping machine you had a a strap form those."
those were fixed .
"not in concrete but er you had erm they were wedged from the the erm oh there was a a granary above barn, then from the rafters there, you had a a bit of wood to to wedge them down solid."
so they wouldn't move.
"so there was a sort of clutch, er this sort of sliding."
"yes er there was no clutch, only something you could erm it was a forked iron er over the strap, and then you had a a long plank in in above the chaff cutter, that was the most dangerous thing."
"and then there was an iron bar going from this plank, through the wall, and you could er then this sort of a a pronged thing that was over the strap, you you could push it over with that pulling the the plank up here."
"it pushed the strap, from one pulley to another, to the loose pulley or the fixed pulley on the end of the long shafting."
why was the the chaffer considered the most dangerous then?
"well, you had to feed it you know erm then there was this erm er sort of a whipping in in there was a long trough leading to to the knife and then there were some cogwheels which pulled it into the knife."
"and should you be careless enough to get your fingers caught in there, well that would be the end, it would draw you in and it would chop your fingers and your arm off in in half inch er bits you know."
"and then er er but it was this was fixed right above, then you could, reach if you did feel you hand getting caught, you could slide it off and stop the switch it onto loose pulley immediately."
so.
so so so there were three pieces of machinery that you could run?
yes.
yes.
"the chaffer, the slicer and the scrapper."
yeah and and and the corn crusher.
oh.
for for for grinding the oats.
"but there were some people you know on a smallish farm, they didn't have an oil engine, then they would have to turn the scrapper by hand."
and that was real hard work.
"er i saw how they used to do it in the after they'd finished work, used to be at it till till nine or ten that night."
"and at one time, we used to feed what we called , for the used to chaff some of the the poorest hay and straw and spread it out in a thick layer about oh twelve of fifteen inches high on the floor of the of the barn."
"and then, scrap the  and throw that over."
"make it into a a thick layer, and then in a day of so, the juice from the  would have soaked into this second class hay and er you used to mix it with a fork and load it into into bags."
"and when you were carrying it on your back into the sheds for the cattle, the juice would be would be soaking through the bags."
your back would be soaking wet.
"it was not very healthy food erm we gave up doing that because er as you know cattle, they chew their cud."
"well they like to cut their food in their own length, and roll it into balls in their mouth and then they can er regurge it up and chew it."
"well with this  stuff, they couldn't do that and then they they they their stomach used to get compacted they they they couldn't er couldn't er get their cud up and caused a lot of stomach trouble."
so and they were tempted to eat erm poor stuff which they they wouldn't eat otherwise because there was the juice of the  soaked to it.
"and er that went fashion the two reasons and the most was because it's it was it would compact in their stomachs, they couldn't lift it up again."
couldn't get their cud up.
oh i see.
yeah.
with er  this machinery.
yes?
er were you ever in a position to to help other farmers er if they wanted their.
with the with the corn grinding.
corn grinding  slicing or.
oh no no just they were bringing the corn to put through the crusher.
right.
er not with the hay or with the .
but with with the corn er few people had then they used to er to bring it over.
"i i remember er that was the way my father used to get a a bit of pocket money to buy tobacco and things, a shilling a sack and the other farmers they used to find the the biggest sack they could find you know, and cram it with oats and then you used to be after supper."
"i can remember waking up up about one o'clock in the morning, and to hear this old oil oil engine going, puff puff, puff puff, puff puff."
"and the and the whine of the crusher you know, the two plates rubbing against ."
"about one o'clock in the morning he'd be at it, getting it ready for the neighbours to collect the following day."
for a shilling a bag.
u maybe he'd be at it till about two o'clock in the morning.
so he would actually do the work himself?
oh yes yes then after after the men had gone to bed .
i see.
and then that was the his tobacco money.
"and he was a heavy smoker, an ounce a day."
although it only cost about eightpence ha'penny an ounce then.
mm.
were you involved in in operating this machinery?
"yes yes yes when when when i grew older, it took all the men when er you know one would the the whole lot would be going together you know."
"the erm the the crusher, the hopper was fixed underneath the granary and then there'd be a little trap-door in the floor or a granary, right above and you could er shovel the the corn, the oats down into."
"then that would feed itself, but you had to have one man feeding the the scrapping machine and another man with a shovel, pulling away the the the the the the scrapped  at the side and then you had to have another man feeding the long hay into the chaff cutter."
and another one moving the chaff away to one side.
so it took four men.
when the the three machines were going together.
needed four men to attend them.
"so in fact, although they were there to save labour."
.
they in fact involved quite a lot.
a lot of labour yes but that was far far better than to have to turn them by hand you know.
that was just slavery.
mm.
how long would they all be going?
over what period of time would would you have all of them going together?
"you mean, during the day or well it took about an hour say."
about two afternoons a week.
and how often how often does that go on throughout the year?
throughout the winter.
yes.
"say when we would used to bring the the stock in at the  menai bridge fair, that was the twenty fourth of october."
and then you started erm getting food for the chopping and grinding food for them.
and that went until they went out in late april.
from the end of april to from the end of october to the end of april say.
mm.
"can during the winter, what sort of things would the carter be then?"
"well erm he in the spring after you had turned the cattle out, the the sheds you know, the cattle  it would be full of manure."
"then after you had finished the sowing, that would be the next job."
clearing out all the manure into the er big heap down into the fields where you wanted to spread them next winter.
"and then erm, the threshing was over, before you started ploughing, you'd have two carts going carting this this manure out and."
i  do have a seat.
thank you.
what can i do for you today?
oh yes.
"i  clinic on this blood test,."
"we did some blood tests, that's right."
we did.
"that's right, because you had sugar in your wee and we thought we really must have a look at what we've got, your fasting blood sugar was absolutely fine, so that looks normal."
had you had your breakfast that morning?
"yeah, erm."
good.
"spot of, of  er when?"
for the blood test you mean?
yeah.
"oh yeah, no i had."
"so you'd had a big breakfast and it's still normal which implies you're going to be fine, now."
"what we really need to do is keep an eye, if it looks like you keep leaking sugar out,."
mhm.
we may have to do what's called a glucose tolerance test.
right.
"i hope not, it's a real hassle to do, so."
mm.
erm  er and it involves going to the lab and sitting around for about a couple of hours while they feed you a bit of sugar and then take some blood tests every half hour.
"but, but we've done er a completely normal random sample and that should be fine."
"so if it settles down, and you don't have any more next time,keep an eye on you as we normally do every few   well we'll be seeing you fairly soon, won't we?"
"we'll be seeing you in another two weeks anyway, won't we?"
yeah.
"two weeks, yeah."
okay.
"well we'll have a chat about what you're like then,."
okay.
"nice fresh sample of wee, not the first wee of the morning,."
no.
okay?
but a nice fresh sample.
okay.
okay.
have you got a bottle?
"i have yes, thanks."
you've got your bottle?
yes.
yes i have.
make sure you wash it out.
"and then we'll see if, take things from there, is that okay?"
"that's fine, thanks."
great.
"great news, thanks."
okay.
very much.
and everything else.
"yes,."
i'm a bit  bum but er.
well.
you're going to get bigger i'm afraid.
"i've finished work, now so."
oh right.
okay.
"right then,."
"right,."
very much.
see you.
bye.
bye.
well my name's thomas nelson .
i am seventy one years of age.
i was born on christmas day nineteen twelve.
"unfortunately my father was killed in the first war, nineteen seventeen january, and my mother was left with four children to bring up."
my mother worked all her life and she retired at eighty three which is not bad going.
pretty good.
as a family we couldn't get school quick enough to try and earn a bob or two for to help my mother.
i left school at fifteen years of age.
which schools did you go to?
i went to  school then  secondary school.
i started work with a fishmonger or a hawker rather round the streets and when a woman cried over the window for fish i ran up the stairs and delivered it.
from there.
how much did you get paid for that?
oh eleven shillings i think it was eleven shillings a week.
and what kind of hours?
and it was oh nine o'clock to two o'clock.
er and i had three shillings change.
two a half crown and a sixpence and a threepenny and three pennies and sometimes he forgot to take it back but however i didn't remind him.
after that i started in  bakery as an apprentice baker.
and i worked there until oh nineteen forty nine or nineteen fifty.
when was it you started there?
oh that would be what er  that'd be about ?
nineteen twenty nine?
aye more or less that that's right.
and it was a five year apprenticeship was it ?
five year apprenticeship yes and er it was more or less labourer work you were just a boy and run and did messages and carried whatever the journeymen bakers wanted.
er you didn't really start thinking seriously about being a baker until about your last year of your apprenticeship.
and made it part of the job that you had to attend night school classes for bread baking and confectionery.
where did you go for that?
went to a night school in fountain bridge.
and if you had a complete attendance you got your er you got your fee back again from the from  .
but you had to pay it initially?
paid but if you had a complete attendance they gave you the money back for your self which was quite er a good thing in these days when a a tanner was a tanner.
i served er my apprenticeship as i said in .
i was married in nineteen thirty seven the war breaking out in nineteen thirty nine.
i became very interested in the trade union movement and my first appointment was as a collector in  collecting the union dues and taking them the union office.
and the scope of that work i had enrolled all the the lady workers both on the confectionery side and the dispatch side and that made it what you would term as a closed shop.
did you take er members complaints and things when you collected the dues or they had anything to pass on ?
yes yes if members had any complaints about their work i would report it up at the head office and up up at the the branch office in  park.
and er take their sick lines up and bring back their sick money and such things as that.
er i even visit a number of homes and delivered their sick money.
this was all part of the the set up.
and i carried on doing that for quite a number of years and i managed to be voted onto the edinburgh committee.
and i progressed from there to vice chairman chairman and local organizer full time local organizer.
that was in nineteen fifty four.
my job as local organizer was going the bakeries collecting the dues where there was no collector and dealing with complaints.
in nineteen sixty six i stood for election of the national organizer and was successful and joined the head office in glasgow in may nineteen sixty six.
the area i covered as a national organizer was from berwick to stirling and everything .
now as a national organizer all the branches in your area if they had any complaints or anything that they wanted attending to used to write to their national organizer and i used to visit and deal with their complaints.
well er going back to when i started serving my time as an apprentice er i think i started with eleven shillings and i was there for about nine months when the manager come over and says to me he had been paying me short.
about one and odds a week short.
and i got a packet with a few quid in it that day which my mother er appreciated.
anyway it was very kind of the manager to do that he could have said nothing.
i think the wages went up round about a half a crown the first year or five bob the second year in er er progressing like that.
and when your time was out there was no question of you not getting a journeyman's wages you were you were paid that alright.
and did they tend to keep their apprentices on at ?
yes.
very little very few apprentices were sacked unless through misdemeanour or anything but if you done your work you were there to you you liked.
now in in the bakery at that time it was one of the most progressive bakeries in the city and it must have employed about a hundred bakers.
maybe forty women and er so many van men dispatch workers and van men.
the the thing that er sticks out is that at time there was no women organizing the union and er i had a go at organizing the women and i was very successful.
because at the end of the day we had a hundred percent women in the union in that bakery.
but i must say through help of the national agreement and that takes us back to nineteen forty seven.
all local agreements up and down the country which it counted to eighty odds were all scrubbed and there was what you call a national agreement established to cover the whole of scotland which meant the man in the remotest part of scotland got the same wages and conditions as in as the man in edinburgh or glasgow or any big city.
and that was a a certainly a step forward for the the little places.
and they loved the national agreement  .
how long did it take to establish that did it take you a long time to?
it must have took about three years any way.
it i think forty five they started negotiating forty five forty to forty seven and er when we tried to alter the national agreement or change it in our minds for the better you always had the solid block of these wee fellows up and down the country sticking by the national agreement because they got such a good deal out of it it brought their standards right the the best that was going.
and by no way were they going to let the national agreement down.
anyway.
to take you back a wee bit before that er when you were an apprentice was your tuition from your journeymen quite good ?
oh going back to the apprenticeship you were more or less left  as you stood because i i thought that journeymen were very what's the word very er they were only too willing to let you know what was going on and when you think about it you can see why.
in these days they were feared of their job.
there was unemployment going about and the man that had a certain job at making certain things weren't to keen to show the apprentice what to do or give them the recipes.
but however you you wangled them some way and you you eventually learnt your trade by half going to classes at night school and half of information from the bakers you had to put two and two together and you worked it out.
was the night school classes were they quite beneficial?
the night school classes were very er efficient because the teachers that taught in the night school were actually bakers.
expert bakers in the trade and er they showed you it from a to z.
although some of the things that you were taught you maybe never got a chance to do them in the bakery.
you were only a sort of number in a bakery and er worked at a table the rest.
you weren't doing anything individual it was more communion thing you were making the likes of if it was brown bread you're all standing rolling up and chaffing brown bread and putting them in tins.
then you went the next thing you all done the same thing over and over again.
but there were some individual jobs where you had their wee experts er doing sponges and er icing cakes and all these individual jobs.
the man that was the best at it got the job.
but most of my work in the bakery was on the the small side scones and pancakes and crumpets and er little cakes.
that was er more or less the compartment that i worked in.
they had other compartments where it was only bread and other compartments where it was just confectionery.
but er this is how they they wanted the work done and it wasn't a question of one man had to learn the lot you just had to do work away where you were sent to work  .
now  was one of the biggest bakeries in edinburgh you told me it was er three stories and each story had a different function .
yes.
it was a it was a very big bakery  it had three floors and on the bottom floor was that's where they done the bread and rolls.
on the second floor it was all the scones and tea bread and currant bread and on the top floor it was all confectionery work and sponge making and what have you and pies.
but er it was quite interesting and er more or less you got a chance of going through the departments when you were before your time was out.
but er that was how they they got you into the the trade.
if you were keen and that well it was yourself a lot how you how you picked up a lot of things because if you were keen you could pick up anything you wanted if you weren't well that was just too bad it's your own fault.
now did you work er an eight hour day?
yes it was an eight hour day.
the apprentices er didn't start before six o'clock in the morning they couldn't start apprentice before six o'clock in the morning until he was maybe in his last year then it would be either one o'clock or two o'clock in the morning.
and the hours er the early that's what they called the early men they went in at one o'clock.
they were they preparatory workers they called them.
and they had everything ready for the squad coming in you know.
well the main squad would come in about two o'clock or three o'clock and er  was already for them to start working.
now on a saturday when they come to a saturday the early start was eleven o'clock at night.
and i think the last start was about one o'clock in the morning and you got extra payments for the extra hours.
but you you always needed early men in.
preparatory men in because if you took a body of men into a bakery half of them would be standing looking about doing nothing until something was prepared.
so that was ideal having preparatory workers.
so you were working eight er eight hours six days a week?
eight hours six days a work that's right.
could you give me an example of how you went about making a a bread scone or a roll or what had to be done?
well in in our in our in our er compartment where it was scones and crumpets and pancakes and everything they had the they had the special man that done the dough in.
then the dough was all cut out a table where you had men chaffing them up.
that's rounding them making them round.
then you had a a squad of men pulling them out and cutting them.
putting them up in the wires and other men putting them on the hot plates to fire.
that was a process there.
oh and the bread again it you had your dough men on the bread who made the doughs.
the doughs were  come through the machine cut into sizes certain weights moulded and the men put them in tins.
and er that was a constant process from start to finish.
you were on the same thing all day all day long.
a a set plain bread.
plain bread was a different matter.
it comes through the comes through the machines and moulded.
then it had to be loaded up what they call long thin boards.
and the boards were carried onto the drop plate and knocked out.
and you knocked the next one out until you got whole complete drop plate of of bread.
and that was put in the oven to fire it.
it took about two and a half hours to fire that bread.
cos pan bread was only about three quarters of an hour.
so that's why they tried to fade plain bread out the market altogether.
takes to long to make and fire.
but that's the bread with the two crusts.
the top crust and the bottom crust.
compared to the pan bread there's a crust all round it.
that was er that was the process of bread.
well in these days your your sponges had to be set in the afternoon for the men coming in  in the morning.
"but nowadays they have machines, high ratio machines which beat this dough up in three minutes."
these doughs are made in three minutes now where it used to take six hours.
or the process was six hours.
so you'd be producing thousands of scones and lots of bread.
yes yes.
turning them out.
that's right.
there was er you had er you had a certain amount to make every day.
some days was more that others.
especially at the weekends.
there was more at the weekends than there was through the middle of the week.
and it was all girdle scones  scones muffins cream scones currant scones pancakes crumpets treacle crumpets treacle pancakes and all this.
but er it you got enough to keep your day going anyway.
and er as i say that was one of the busiest bakeries in edinburgh.
during that period.
mm.
don't remember how many shops they had then do you?
had a lot of shops ?
yes.
they had over a hundred shops in in edinburgh.
i i couldn't tell you the exact number but it was over a hundred  shops in edinburgh.
but i think they've closed a few since then.
there's a lot of them been closed since then.
now what were your conditions?
what was it like to work in in  factory?
well the conditions were top conditions.
er comparing bakery with bakery  were as good conditions as anybody.
and they had also er showers for you wash up when you finished.
wash hand basins in the toilets and everything.
it was er the standard of hygiene that you could get.
the basic you get at that time.
and er.
was it very hot if you were working in the ovens there?
yes.
well these were the hottest place that you could work at the ovens of dough in the bread ovens.
the sweat was running down your back all day and i've seen me taken off my white clothes and hang them up and they were still wet when you come in the next day.
and er working at the hot plates that was a hot job .
you were over the hot plate all the time.
but there was no extra money for that.
ovens er ovens men.
but this has only happened since we got the national agreement.
ovens men and dough men got extra money.
but er the extra money they got was no worth taking the job.
it wasn't worth the responsibility.
but they tell me it's been increased immensely now what they get for being an oven man.
because at the end of the day nobody would take the job.
the responsibility they had a pound was no covering it as far as they were concerned.
they so it could be five pound now for the responsibility i don't know.
but it was a very responsible job because if you got an oven for your stuff and you burnt that  boy there's a lot of waste .
so they had to get a chap that knew his business and i think he was entitled to get extra money.
and the dough man was just as in the same responsible position.
because he could jigger up the doors just the same as anybody else.
so i think he was quite right in handing out to get extra money.
because he could ruin a dough as well as anybody else.
what about er safety was it a fairly safe place to work?
yes.
er  bakery was pretty safe.
they had maintenance men of their own who they seen that all the machine was guarded and everything else.
but you know you'll always get the chap that comes along and lifts the guard to get his hand in and he loses a finger and he blames that he blames the firm.
but er no as a as a safety bakery it was  as good as any.
as good as any i would say.
but very little accidents in .
now er during the war baking was er a reserved occupation.
can you tell me anything about that ?
yes.
well when the war broke out the all bakers the age of twenty seven was reserved.
which meant that er you could try and get away if you liked but you you mentioned you were a baker and they looked at your age you were .
so anybody that worked at the baking trade and was twenty seven was reserved.
could not get into the army.
anybody under that is they were taken away to the army no bother.
and er during the war we didn't have the freedom for making the stock that we we done the war.
a lot of all these lines were cut down you know.
couldn't get supplies?
that's where er we made some money potato scones.
it was er potatoes were being used oh bags and bags of potatoes were used in  i don't know.
went into everything.
pies scones  and they made their own  with the potatoes.
they bought the potatoes and they put them into this machine to mix them up with a couple of pails of water and then they drained all the taters off and left the milk that was left and used that for the baking.
but er.
were conditions any different during the war?
well no no not really.
i would say conditions were a wee bit easier a wee bit you had a wee bit more freedom because they knew they could not replace anybody if they gave the sack.
and if they did give you the sack you would be walked away to the army i expect.
but every firm every private firm was took the advantage of the reservation.
that the bakers would be reserved at twenty seven.
the only bakery that i know that didn't do that was the .
the  didn't reserve anybody and quite a lot of their men at forty was taken away to the army.
and how how they got on er with losing these men i just don't know.
but they never reserved anybody the .
so if you were in the  and you were forty years of age you weren't safe for going to the to go to the army.
well er continuing on  bakery the bottom floor which was a break making plan.
now during the war when we had to have all the windows sealed and blacked out that place became very warm and very uncomfortable to work in.
and eventually the bakers nicknamed it the belsen camp.
now the squad that worked down there when anybody left there was nobody would take their place.
because they didn't want to work under these conditions.
and as as i say they had to put all the mens name in the hat and pick them out and put up a roster and they had their turn of going down the bread week by week.
but ten to fifteen bakers to my knowledge left go down to what they called the belsen camp.
and the the firm was very annoyed at hearing this name getting banded about because it was getting  a bad name.
but that is really truly what happened.
it was that uncomfortable to work in.
every window was black with paint and there was no air coming in and you walk very very hot ovens and the sweat was lashing down your back.
so they had every difficulty in getting bakers to work down there.
"now if we can go back to the period when the eighty odd agreements was developed into one national agreement, it seemed to break up what we would term a big happy family."
because all the local places that had agreements everybody knew you knew their families and whatever.
and the interest in the trade trade unionism was kept alive.
but since we got the national agreement in nineteen forty seven the same interest wasn't in the trade union movement.
although heaven knows we tried to keep it there.
but the simple reason that the men the local men had nothing to do with making the agreement now so they lose they lost interest in the trade union movement.
and er further to further that opinion when we got the dues taken off the worker's wages and delivered to the office that still didn't help the the matter.
it still helped the remote chance of getting people to come to the meetings.
they had no interest in the trade union movement.
the the dues was deducted of their wages so therefore why should they go to meetings.
they hadn't they had no er inherent right to make resolutions or ask for increase in wages that was all done at conference by their their representatives.
"so i think bringing out the national agreement, although it was a great development for the union, and these docked a lot of the work they had to beforehand had to do, it certainly didn't help the relations and the entries in the trade union movement."
more or less i think it went against the entries because the members just wouldn't turn the meetings.
did you get the feeling when you moved about that the members felt this that the the organizers of the union was a wee bit adrift?
well that's a feeling you got moving around that er what the hell was the good of coming to a meeting you had no say in your conditions or wages or whatever.
it was all taken up by the top brass  you know .
and this is what you got.
but as you look at it nowadays you can see if they were going back to these days would we still have the same interest.
would they still come to the meetings.
because we had halls where the members couldn't get in it was packed.
but nowadays you're lucky if you get a dozen.
and it's only because they have no rights in what they're negotiating for.
and negotiations are all done on their behalf.
and they've gotta lump it or like it.
you you can't have much influence in in these decisions?
no well  more or less the branches had the opportunity to send in resolutions to the national agreement which were dealt with at conference.
but regarding wages and hours they were all taken by the executive council and debated at the national joint committee with the employers.
but it was what the executive council thought the increase in wages should be not what the members thought.
and i think this done away with a lot of entries and keeping people meetings.
when did you actually go back to  when did you you worked there after the war for a while did you?
yes.
i worked in  up there about nineteen fifty or fifty one when i had a dispute with the manager and i gave him a week's notice.
you want to say anything about that?
well it was on at that time i was dropping pancakes and crumpets and the manager come up one morning and said that there was running late.
the despatch was complaining that the stuff was late.
well you either left the line for me to try two or three mixes for custom purposes.
which meant you had to try the mixing drop it onto the plate count how many you got out it clean out the machine and try another one and do the same again and the same again.
"i told him this and he says, is that all it takes minutes."
"so i says, well if it only take minutes you bloody well do it yourself."
and at that moment i told him to take my week's notice.
during the week he come back asking me if i forget about it and withdraw my notice but stubborn as i was i refused.
and i left  in about nineteen fifty or fifty one and started in a little shop in  road in .
how were your er wages moving by this time?
did the war make a big difference to the wages?
er the wages weren't really moving in these er times.
er we had lost quite during the war.
the war the bakers was at the top of the tree of tradesmen.
three pound nineteen and six or four pound one shilling that was about the top wages in in the land at that time for tradesmen.
but during the period of the war the bakers sadly fell down to about the middle of the table through the old saying that you've got to be patriotic and help the war effort.
so the bakers lost out during the war.
and it took us a long long time to try and get back where we were.
and we're still not there yet.
although we're getting nearer and nearer.
when you worked er before the war did you experience any wage cuts?
the war no no.
er the war we we did very the three pound nineteen and six and the four pound one that i'm talking about that was all done with local negotiations.
locally we done that and it wasn't until we went nationally under national agreement we lost the wayside.
and er we fell by the wayside in the wages right.
and we never got back again.
the.
mm.
are still very poorly paid.
how about your hours.
were your hours coming down ?
er we got the hours down to eventually we got the hours down to forty four.
i think it was forty six forty seven forty er forty six forty five forty four.
they come down that way.
er and usually we maybe had to give them a holiday.
we lose a holiday for to get an hour off the working week.
but these were all the traps in negotiations.
now when you moved to  was that  a kind different kind of work obviously you were doing a wee bit more variety.
there was only about three of you was there?
yes it was different type of work altogether.
er  was on a smaller scale and more done with the hand than machine.
you had your certain lot of wee machines that helped you to do things but more or less it was all done with the hand.
even er the breaking of dough was done with a lot of a little wringers thing you know.
compared with these big electric rollers.
but the however we got by and it was a very progressive wee bakery.
but unfortunately the parting of the ways had to come and i worked in another wee shop er down in albert street in leith.
you want to say why you left ?
well it was through er  up and i ended up doing bakers work.
i complained and although it was stopped i still got my books later.
so you moved down to albert street.
so i.
which is another small bakery?
i moved down to albert street which is was in the borders of edinburgh and leith.
"and er during the time i was in  in albert street although i was still very interested in the union and on the committee i think i was president or vice president at the time, there the job for a local organizer come up."
but with me being in practically the borders of edinburgh leith branch was  er they pulled me into leith branch.
they say i should've been a member of leith branch.
but our to avoid that situation i left  and went to work with  which kept me in the edinburgh branch and within three or four weeks i stood for the local organizer and had not been successful.
and that was the end of my baking days.
what was this  full time union work?
that was full time union work.
"er just before we go onto you union work, what were you having   was quite a good employer i believe?"
yes.
they when i when i became a full time employer er a full time employee with the union it was all more or less small bakeries.
the only er   and the  that was about the only three big bakeries and they had plenty of collectors and shop stewards in these places to look after themselves.
but i'd dealt more or less with the small firms even to the the extent of collecting dues.
and attending to their complaints.
now that developed that developed from er nineteen fifty four to nineteen sixty six.
that was twelve years.
when er i stood for the election of the national organizers for the east of scotland and i was successful there and i left the edinburgh branch in may nineteen sixty six to start work with the head office in may nineteen sixty six.
and i was there from may sixty er may nineteen sixty six to december seventy seven.
which was about another twelve years.
now how did you first get  interested in the trade unions mr ?
well i got interested in the trade unions because at that time more or less  eighty five of the workers went to the trade union meetings.
so the men always made sure the apprentices went and er it was just a matter over the years going to the meetings that you get interested in the business of the trade unions.
and er it developed from there that er i was appointed collector at  collecting the money and er.
would you tell me a wee bit about that?
well when you collected the dues er it meant taking it the office every monday and when you got the office and got talking to the officials and such like the interest became greater and er it developed from there that er  the workers of  thought they should have er should have a representative on the committee.
and er i was put up for the committee and was successful and sat on the committee for quite a number of years.
what kind of things did you do there?
well on the committee you dealt with you met once a week on a wednesday.
there was about ten on the committee and er the full time secretary.
now we dealt with all complaints that had been lodged during the week and er  would be attended.
and also er letters that had been sent from head office.
these were all dealt with on a wednesday night and the secretary would get his instructions how to deal with them or or how or when to deal with them.
and this was er more or less the trade union business.
and and between that er every year the conference was held and er we had four meetings a a year local meetings.
quarterly meetings which they call them that was held in er the odd fellows hall in forest road and i think it was the march january february march quarterly meeting that they er the ballot was taken for delegates for the conference.
the conference was held in june.
and all your big branches glasgow dundee aberdeen and edinburgh was allowed six delegates.
the er secretary went because he was a full time official.
so that was the er full secretary and six delegates attended and er put up the case for edinburgh branch.
only resolutions that stood in the name of the edinburgh branch was dealt with by some of these delegates.
and also any alterations or recommendations for the national agreement the case was put up for the delegates.
and er you would have maybe a hundred and twenty delegates attending from all over scotland.
the small branches only got one delegate and that would be the part time secretary  branch secretary he would attend.
and er but they had they they said very little.
er you got one or two bright er part time branch secretaries and some of the wee branches quite capable lads.
and er they would put up any case that they had from their branch.
but on the whole they had er what you call a standing orders committee.
that was picked er the whole.
the voting er you voted for them at the delegate meeting and i think it was the six top six highest in the vote became the standing orders.
now they met on the friday the the delegate meeting and went all all over the agenda.
and anything that was to be ruled order or they did it.
but but doing that they met with the branch that had put the resolution in.
they met with the branch and discussed it with them and told them how it was order.
and usually that was accepted.
although it had to come to the  before it was accepted.
and er that was er that was er the main topics of the conference.
the rest was the rest on the agenda was resolutions dealing with the broader feeling on the economy and what have you.
the likes of scotland's economy that was on nearly every trade union agenda at conferences.
every year.
but it never did it any good they never got to run their own economy.
so that was that covered you delegate meeting.
what kind of resolutions would you  bring up there?
well er protocol you know.
er in fact there was very little resolutions dealing with their own business.
more or less dealing with the labour party business of the government business.
and any any what i call resolutions that were passed they were sent to the proper departments of government.
and er  whatever happened to them after that er.
we usually got one back saying they'd been accepted and they'd deal with them at a  certain time you know .
but er that was practically your conference.
now they set aside a day of the conference for er deal with the national agreement.
and er all the branches had a cook at the national agreement how to try and alter it and make it better.
but it was usually the big branches that was doing the cooking.
and er when it come to a vote to try and get anything passed or changed the wee branches were solid voting for the national agreement.
so you had very little chance to change any.
unless it was changed at er a yearly in the negotiations.
but er it certainly did a lot for the bakers but as i said it certainly took away the happy family union that we had before.
because the national agreement come into being our our  of the meetings dropped down dropped down dropped down until there were very few attending.
and i think the reason for that was because they didn't have a say in what was happening.
now to take you back to  when you were on the committee representing  what kind of complaints did you have to get there?
well one of the commonest complaints that we had to deal with was er when your time was up at twelve o'clock you they usually kept you working until about five or ten past twelve.
that that was a regular thing and er that was unpaid .
then you had to take that the office and report it to the the branch secretary who would come down and deal with it with the management.
"but they just in these days they just looked at them and said, alright."
but it happened it kept going on happen.
but one of the complaints that i was very bitter about was at that time i cycled to my work and they had paving stones in the bakery with the slits in them for to keep bikes.
and er i used to keep my bike in there.
and this day when i come out the bike was gone.
i went the union and reported it and asked them to do something about it.
they said oh they couldn't do nothing about that but er didn't think they could do much about it.
anyway i i bought a little book that i saw in one of the shops and it was er the industrial lawyer.
"and in that little book it said, if the firm provided space for bicycles or what have you they were responsible for them."
and i took that little book the union and showed it to the branch secretary and still i never got my bike or any compensation for it.
i was very bitter about that.
then that i got that book back when i became a full time official it was still in the  still in the office .
so i took it away.
but er i that's one of the complaints that i was very bitter about.
i thought i should've got some er compensation anyway or something.
but i don't think the branch secretary bothered himself much about it.
and i was to blame for not keeping on his  and making him do something about it.
er the other complaints were just more or less er maybe arguments er workers getting into trouble over their  arguing about frivolous things you know.
shouldn't have been doing that and shouldn't have been doing that.
and er there was always two sides to these stories.
but you report it anyway and let the let the branch official deal with it.
but more or less  er dirty towels for drying your hands that's another common common complaint.
and as i say er seven people seven workers did  when they all that trouble started  the bread.
these were all things that er you.
i reported them when i went up but whether there was any success in the things i just don't know.
one of the another thing that i remember when i was in  er they come to the er delegate meeting in june.
you've gotta ask to get away for three days.
"and i went into the management the bakery manager and asked him and he says to me, this is not a cooperative bakery."
i says i know i says it's not only cooperative bakeries that's in the agreement.
"anyway i says, well i've asked you and you've said told me no."
i says well i'm gonna take it higher.
so i went the general manager mr  and he he told me certainly i can go.
so.
however how however how the  managers felt i don't know.
but i certainly got to the delegate meeting.
er.
what about organizing the women?
did you do that before you were full time?
oh yes i was collector collected the money the dues and in er  bakery at the time.
but er the national agreement was established by then and er i just i just took it upon myself to try  the women and that i was very successful.
but then  where it was a closed shop.
we got every every women that worked in the bakery into the union.
now on the ground flat it was a despatch where they despatched the goods.
that was all women .
but we never touched them at that time.
because we we hadn't wages or conditions or anything like for them.
can i begin by asking you how.
yes you do please i'd rather.
how.
you did.
yes.
how do i address you?
is it nurse ?
yes.
yes.
that's right yes.
"nurse  or mrs , which you like."
yes.
were you born on anglesey?
i was.
in  did you want to hear that?
yes.
in .
"primrose place , and it's still there now."
the little house.
were you born into a big family?
yes.
five of us and we're all alive.
what did your parents do?
erm well my father was a like a on a a small farmer's son you see.
and he was a man of all trade in the end because my grandfather's like that.
he could do anything.
but he did help most in the  with the graveyards in the end and he used to ring the bell in the church.
he was a bell ringer for years.
my father was.
and my great grandfather he was a bookbinder.
he's buried in .
"and er i used to think in the old days that bookbinding was a very common thing, but since i've grown er and gone through the world, i thought he was a very clever man."
he's buried in  and he was the only bookbinder round here.
did you got to school in ?
yes.
i went to school in  till i was fourteen.
did you enjoy school?
yes i did i would have liked to have gone much farther but i couldn't.
my grandparents said they couldn't afford it.
"but i think they could have afforded, just the idea of me leaving home."
i'd have to stay in holyhead for a few nights.
and no bike you see.
is that how most children got to the school there?
yes.
and most er most of the children you see went from  to holyhead.
there were no buses them days.
they had to walk to valley station to the train unless their people could afford to buy them bicycles .
so erm.
did you have any ambitions at school?
i did.
i wanted to be a teacher.
or a nurse.
so what did you do when you left school?
erm well i went to liverpool.
i was promised that i could learn i could be a nurse if i went and i went to the bishop of liverpool's erm household in liverpool.
er i met them in  when they were on holiday and that's how i got in.
and she took to me and she took me to liverpool and they were very good to me.
i was there till i was married.
i forgot about the nursing.
i they were so good and i was so happy that the nursing went you see.
so what were you doing there?
er well i was doing all kinds really there was a staff then and of servants but i was i was er looking after the old lady more than anything.
and doing afterwards i did er see the war came and they couldn't get people.
people went to do ammunition and all that.
see there's more money.
so i erm took  i i helped the parlour work.
when the when the er what do you call him?
"the butler went off, there was no butler then so i really helped with the with the  with the with the food and all that you know."
i enjoyed it very much.
i forgot about my nursing .
"and see good nice people visited you see, and they were always very kind."
did you miss anglesey?
well no i didn't miss anglesey because er my outlook was to get away and to do something different.
you see.
i was never homesick.
how long were you in liverpool?
"nineteen   from eighteen to thirty three, what does that come to?"
er fifteen years.
.
"eighteen and ten, twenty years."
twenty.
"yes you were right, fifteen years."
yes.
i was married in nineteen twenty three.
"from the bishop's palace, in the welsh church in liverpool."
it's not there now.
a lovely welsh church .
"and the bishop married me there and the vicar and er quite a lot of people had come there from all over like because i was being marrying in the welsh church you see, i didn't have a lot of and the bishop married me, that was something for them to come."
and i went to liverpool to london for my honeymoon.
my husband came from hastings.
how did you get back into nursing?
well i lost my husband in nineteen thirty three.
it would be.
"in nineteen thirty three, my husband died suddenly."
i don't want to go into that.
"and erm it's a sad, very sad tale."
and then you see i gave up my home in liverpool and came to anglesey to my people.
"well i wasn't happy here, i wanted my own place."
and i wanted to be doing something so i went i went back to nursing.
i went to do midwifery.
i went to london for my training.
how long did that take?
pardon?
how long did that take you?
the training.
it took two years.
"because i took midwifery and i took a little bit of erm school nursing and general you know, i was capable take a district on anglesey."
i wanted to be on anglesey because my son was at school by then you see in .
he was only four and a half when his father died.
after your training did you come straight back to anglesey?
yes i came to back to to rhos-y-bol.
well i did a bit round er  like not llandudno.
rhyl and that area.
"because my superintendent from anglesey, she was superintendent from  you see."
and then she was short of a nursing there and then i went there for a bit.
there was a gap in anglesey.
what was it like in rhos-y-bol?
er quiet.
people were very kind.
very kind indeed.
they'd share anything with you.
"and erm er they relied on you, they depended on you."
always worrying you if there was something for the least.
i think really they wanted just to get to the house something to talk about those days you see.
"the men were kind, very kind."
nobody'd let me wheel my bike or carry my bag.
if they were about.
there wasn't kinder people anywhere than rhos-y-bol.
the er the older generation.
they're going now you see.
was it smaller then?
lot smaller then.
"oh yes they've built oh dear dear, they've built houses and houses i don't know rhos-y-bol today."
although i only live three miles away you see.
"and i left rhos-y-bol when i retired because i felt i they'd have to have another nurse there, and you see the other nurse would never be able to enjoy the they would always be running to me and it wouldn't be fair to another nurse."
"erm they wouldn't she'd be alright for the first time you see, but they would get tired and then they'd be they'd be me."
i mean it wouldn't be fair to anybody to start afresh there.
so i left and came here.
i bought this plot of land and built this bungalow on it.
how big an area did you have when you  in rhos-y-bol?
it was quite four and half miles round the area you see.
five miles in some places.
you see the area and i did on a bicycle you know.
not like today.
you went twice a day in those days to the mothers and babies.
and you visit them for there was one time we visit them for fourteen day  daily but i don't think they do it now.
and then it cut down to ten days.
but by the time you see i had  the st david's hospital opened by then in bangor.
"see when i came to rhos-y-bol in nineteen thirty three, there was no st david's hospital then, all the babies were born at home."
and er there was only the workhouse at  that they could go.
and i oh i fought hard i never wanted a baby to be born in the wok house cos the word workhouse to me in the old it was a terrible name.
"and i wouldn't like a child of mine and i managed just two i had to send to the workhouse and a mother and baby died there, it was a bad case you see."
"and the other little boy was born there but i used to visit him, i see him on the district and it always came back to me fancy humphrey's the only one shouldn't mention name really."
was born in  you know.
it's a great thing to keep them from and to me in those days.
cos i used to remember er liverpool erm i can't think something hill in wharton hill workhouse.
oh everybody dreaded going there.
"things have changed, things have improved you see."
what did anglesey people think about the workhouse?
well in those days everybody was afraid and erm oh it was a blow if anybody had to go to the valley.
valley was the name those days.
oh dear dear it was worse than i anything i can think of.
"but today you see, the valley hospital is lovely."
it's a different view altogether.
i've been there and i find how happy people are there.
it's really a treat to go there and see how things have changed isn't it.
people are so kind today.
did you use a bike all the time you were at rhos-y-bol?
i used the bicycle from nineteen thirty five  until nineteen fifty.
and i tried to save up for a car cos my son was in the army.
yeah he was taken to the army from the grammar school in holyhead  and i did want a car when he came home.
"i thought, i'd like him to think that i'd improved a little bit."
and erm managed to buy a car and i paid four hundred and ten for it.
just think of it.
what sort of car was it?
it was a lovely little standard.
and then i i exchanged in twelve months cos i was lucky i had put my name in two places to get a car.
you couldn't get in those days during the war you see.
and erm i managed to get one twelve months after and that was an austin ten.
that was a great car we thought you see.
the austin ten and i had that when my son came home from the army.
so he taught me to drive see and it was much easier then you see with a car.
then they added to my district then again.
the rhos-y-bol practically finished.
cos you went to some much bigger area you see.
"so i did a little bit of here and there in rhos-y-bol, relieving different places after after retired really for a couple of years."
how many districts were there?
well when i started i'm sure there was about twenty.
and we we see we'd only have these small areas see.
"see there'd be amlwch, rhos- y-bol,well now it's one area see the lot of it."
"and then there's menai bridge, and  nearly one there's menai bridge was one,was one."
"then the  area, that's right, there's three or four areas that way again you see."
what was your most common sort of problem?
common problem?
getting about i think.
see the weather you see was bad  if you had it bad but i i kept well in health considering you know.
and you know people were very good.
"see people didn't have cars, and if it was now, they could only help me by bringing a horse to meet me or erm or a tractor if they ."
"and then perhaps we could then perhaps they could somebody would shovel the snow and  it was very hard in the winter you know, some places."
"perhaps you could come from  you see, but you wouldn't be able to come near amlwch  or you could get to amlwch and you couldn't get to ."
they were  hard times you know.
and there were no telephones you see when i first came.
didn't get a telephone till nineteen well i couldn't tell you really.
i was years without a telephone in rhos- y-bol.
how did people get you?
well they had to fetch me.
they had to come see.
in their own way.
"with a bike mostly, then i'd go with them on the bike see."
but the we did have a telephone to the post office when it first came.
and then people were making use of that.
but the post office people didn't like it again.
"they had to come, give me my messages you see."
people left messages but that wasn't right again.
so they didn't like telephones.
then er the  county then had to give us telephones.
but really it was it  years without .
what was the prelavent case you had to treat?
was it usually just childbirth?
well it was erm  i don't think i can remember .
bleeding you know what do you call .
what do you call it now .
it was the babies you see that  they were well you had to have the doctor to you.
i only had to call mr   once.
to a case.
"and he was the superintendent of started you see, st david's hospital."
and he came once to me on the district to me i don't know  he went to others.
and  called him.
it was a case of right in the face.
post parting haemorrhage.
and anyway he'd survived.
and we took the mother to bangor next day in the ambulance.
oh it was a terrible place to get the ambulance into.
it was in the fields outside  in the bogs there.
and  people just come here.
"and there was an old lady there and she fell down and broke her arm, we had a terrible night of it."
but she survived and she lived and brought her children and they left to be in england again.
they were english people.
what was your most unusual case?
unusual case?
oh what shall i tell you now?
well i've had cases in the bus you know.
babies in the bus has been born.
i've had them born in the car on the way  the the mother have come to see me the father has brought her to see me thinking that if she could just see me she'd be alright.
but anyway the baby's been born in the car before he got home.
yeah.
it's a scream isn't it.
they're happy days you know.
"happy days and the money was small but still, don't worry."
did that did that get better as time went on?
oh yes.
yes.
"yes, when it first came, it was only  two pound a week."
and i had to pay my rooms that.
five shillings.
that you see and my insurance and all that isn't it.
and it wasn't you see.
but erm i was lucky mind.
people were comfortable and i could always go and get something i wanted.
and people were very farmers those days.
"they were farmers those days, they were you know people with feeling."
you see today it's the men servants of the old farms that are farmers today.
see the old farmers they were very generous.
"what they had, was yours."
"potatoes,any anything they had, butter and milk, you never came from a farm in the old days without something in your hand."
when you were the district nurse.
and the minister used to get the same.
the minister was well looked after those days to.
we were the we were the poor ones weren't we.
when did that change?
was there a sort of point when it all changed?
yes well it changed see when the war came.
"when the er when the war came, this last war it would be wouldn't it."
erm and people had been paying insurance it changed then cos some of the farmers could go on their pension they'd been paying this new scheme you see.
and then the younger generation took the farms on.
that's when it changed.
the farming changed all together.
and our money was better by then.
i think i was getting nearly five pound a week by then.
well er today see it's my pension is three times as that.
more.
when you think .
so i was paying my superann you see.
"i always paid that, it's a good thing i've done it you know."
otherwise you see that helps on my pension today.
in one way it's a great help.
but i suppose if i hadn't got anything i'd get it from somewhere.
i find those that haven't got anything are just as today.
did you have a union?
well i suppose you would call it a union wouldn't you.
erm the midwives  the midwife had erm now what did you call it?
it was like a union  for the midwives you see.
er the nurses had but we didn't  we more district midwives on the district you see.
the things changed and after that.
"when you first arrived at rhos-y-bol, were you taking over from another nurse?"
pardon?
did you take over from another nurse?
at rhos-y-bol or were you the first there ?
yes i did yes.
the nurse had just got married.
the district was only twelve months old.
she'd only been there twelve months.
did you find it hard to get accepted?
pardon?
did you find it hard to get accepted?
no i didn't.
they were no they were very good they were.
they were pleased to have a nurse you see cos they hadn't had a nurse.
the the nurse before me was the first one.
only they didn't know how to treat a nurse.
er it was all new to them you see.
they thought seemed to think you were on duty morning noon and night.
they's come to the door any all time you see.
but it didn't matter you could help isn't it.
you got used to it.
get bad tempered sometimes but then.
were there any superstitions around?
did people still use folk remedies?
no i don't think so.
and i don't think so really.
can't remember anything like that.
what was anglesey like during the war?
did the war affect.
oh yes it did.
cos we had evacuees here you see er during the war.
there was plenty to eat here you know.
you see they came from liverpool a lot of them.
but they used to get very lonely.
"when they came, that was the trouble."
but they used to i had my house packed to the wall.
friends from liverpool i opened my house to.
they would come see perhaps for two or three weekends  you know.
then they's go back to liverpool.
"when it starts  in liverpool again, they'd come back again."
i let my an open house to my friends from liverpool.
friends that had been kind to me.
then they got very  in er after two years after the was had started erm south of england got it badly you see.
so my in-laws were south of england people and i opened my house to them.
"they came for the first lot for nine months, then they went back."
"they came back again, they were here nearly two years."
my in-laws.
from hastings that was you see.
so i was i i had my house full all through the war.
did the evacuees mean a lot more work?
"well i didn't work, i opened the house for them and they looked after themselves."
i never fed them or  they were to look after themselves.
there was a bed for them you see.
and a room to eat .
"and er liverpool people were very good, very kind, they always had a meal for me  things if they could."
and i used to get vegetables you see in from the farmers.
"and very often if anybody was killing a pig or anything, i'd always get a piece of erm pork something like that."
not  the people were very kind in rhos-y-bol.
the old rhos-y-bol people.
did that change after the war?
"changed after the war, yes."
it was the new lots growing up then you see.
they've been brought up different way haven't they.
more .
you see there was milk cheap and different things after the war for them you see.
to babies had this dried milk and some of them got it cheap and i suppose there was no work and then they were poor weren't they.
they used to pay me fifteen shillings a week.
if i had my case at home without a doctor.
and they thought that fifteen pound was an awful lot of money.
"but if they had a doctor you see, they'd have to pay a pound."
so i used to try and manage.
"and i did too, managed very well."
considering.
were most of your patients welsh?
all welsh those days.
after the after the war you see.
but when the war came you see they came as evacuees a lot of them and then they never went back.
and it got on from that you see.
and then er people left the towns and their their relations.
i suppose rhos-y- bol is all english today.
i don't know who lives there.
see all those houses they built .
"in your time as a district nurse, what were the greatest changes you noticed?"
see it's the war that changed everything didn't it.
the war changed everything.
and then went.
and then the land you see they worked more on the land didn't they.
"the men did, farming took er more men didn't it."
"and then the camps you see, during the war, you see people were work during the war before the war in rhos-y-bol."
be sitting on the wall by my  a lot of the men.
"but you see the camp when the war came, opened somewhere in er near valley and everybody got a job."
and a lot of them went away after.
so er things changed completely didn't it.
everything changed after.
what about on the medical side?
oh the medical side was wonderful.
we've had wonderful doctors in amlwch.
"sir thomas , oh he was a marvel."
"he was a dear father and he had two sons, doctors."
marvellous sons he had again.
"and then dr , he was a genius, and he was born in  and i knew my family and his family knew ."
"and you know i adored dr , he was a wonderful man."
"he was kind, didn't say much and worked hard."
he died young in about sixty.
a man that understood the people.
we were very fortunate and we're still fortunate.
we've got lovely young doctors here now.
a dr  from  he was sir thomas's son you know lovely.
"so kind you know, nothing was too much for him."
is there still a district nurse as such?
pardon?
is there still a district nurse as such?
or is it now just er surgeries?
oh no no they have district nurses now.
"cos dr offered me the the other day, a nurse to do my leg."
we're awfully fortunate here.
"you've got a team of young doctors again,to see me."
i think they're marvellous.
we're most fortunate i think.
"i think the young people today, they're very kind you know."
it's only an odd one i think.
"but mind you, people can be awkward too can't they."
erm it isn't the doctors you see that are awkward.
but people can be very awkward.
"i only found about one say a couple of awkward people, all the twenty years i was in rhos-y-bol."
but they were the same family the same same people all through the years.
the awkward ones.
why were they awkward?
just for the sake of being awkward?
"i don't know, they demanded more you see."
"er they wouldn't look for you when you were there, but if you'd gone out somewhere, oh they'd be looking for you."
they wanted to cause trouble.
for there were always something you see with them.
er only one or two of them.
and i think they're still there in rhos-y-bol.
i don't think they'll get rid of them.
they'll grow up and a little bit'll come from somewhere .
mm.
"nothing gives me more pleasure now and if i go to the to the libraries and a young lad i say a young man like you will come to me and say, hello nurse, how are you?"
i's very well thank's.
how are you?
"he said, you remember me don't you?"
"well not quite, i said."
but oh yes.
"and er you know, it's lovely really to see them and to think they remember you still isn't it."
mm.
i used to shout at them you know.
mm.
". my son used to  don't shout at them mother, he said."
"well, i said, they are naughty."
they were running round my house they were.
"so this night my son said to me, mother, he said, when those boys have grown up men, do you know what they'll be saying?"
"i said, no."
"they'll be saying, do you remember a a big fat woman living in that their house, with a white apron running after us."
"they'll remember you like that you know, he said."
it don't worry me how they remember me.
mm.
do you still stay the other district nurses?
"oh yes, but there's very few of them, you'd be i'm eighty four you see."
and erm you see most of them have very few of them .
i  nurse  hers was lovely to work with.
"and nurse williams  into the clinic to see her, they're much younger than me you see."
and they're lovely young people they were to work with really.
it's only those two now i think.
because you know a lot of that had died you know.
they were a lovely little nurse we had in  me and nurse williams from .
she was very.
well we're keen to get here aren't we?
we're in the right place i suppose?
mm.
aha  well they'll be asking the rest of us to take a cut in salary soon .
well if i can.
ha ha ha ha  nice one.
and don't say it.
well if they're not here in five minutes i'm going .
quite right.
"erm er ken, could you er just give me an outline of what what happened?"
what's happened to you.
what's going on since the last time i interviewed you.
which was about.
er.
is it two years ago now i think.
is it two years?
good lord.
er that time we we was living in  bay wasn't we?
that's right yes.
yeah.
erm we was living in the high street i believe.
you were.
yeah that's right yeah.
quite a nice place actually.
er yeah.
that was only a a temporary temporary house.
er we managed eventually to get a a erm a flat off the council.
we was in a two-bedroomed erm council flat but they were intended for old age pensioners like you know.
right.
again was temporary.
erm i think we was there about nine months.
it wasn't a bad place but er a very small one you know.
erm from then we got a council house which is where the wife's living at the moment.
erm  i think  i think we'd have been there about no.
about a year when we decided to split up.
so consequently she's living in  bay and i'm living on my own in up in holyhead.
i moved back to holyhead and been living in a bedsit since june.
. er and i got the job at the centre in august.
"erm  went back into photography, that's basically all that's happened to me."
er did you when er when i saw you when you were living in.
mhm.
erm you gave a a very full account of the sort of pressures that erm you were under because you didn't have a job and you related it to the necessity of involving yourself in what you euphemistically called the black economy.
erm er you've you've indicated that er you've separated now from your wife.
"yeah, that's right."
"erm do you think the fact that you didn't have a job, er contributed to that in any way?"
er that's a hard question.
erm  i don't think it did.
i really don't think so.
"because we're both level headed people and  not having a job was obviously a big thing in our lives and i'd indicated to anne that if we did move away, i would stand a much better chance of getting a job."
but she preferred to stay up here with her family and her friends.
"so i then told her that if we were gonna stay here, the chances of me getting a job were very slim."
so she'd have to face the prospect of me being on the dole for a long time.
and she says she preferred that to to us having to move away.
"erm, i took her at her word, i still looked for work, i didn't stop looking for work but i took it that she was happy enough me being on the dole if it meant that we could stay around  bay or anglesey."
erm we didn't have any major er the major problem was was money.
that was the only that was the only problem associated with not having work.
i kept myself very busy anyway erm in various erm hobbies that i had.
so she was er i was never under her feet.
i'm not the sort of guy that sits around the house like you know.
so i was never under her feet or any of them sort of problems that a lot of people find.
"i find that friends of mine who are unemployed, their wives tend to tend to think that they get under their feet ."
"they're never , erm whereas myself i was always out."
and er i'd come up and stay with my brother in holyhead about two or three times a week.
"er overnight like you know, er when i was doing my work at the centre, the unemployed worker's centre."
"when i was involved in various projects i'd stay overnight so, i'd be the house six hours a day."
so it was just like i was working really except very poor wages like you know.
"erm  i think the the biggest problem we had in our marriage, and the reason it broke up, is because er i'm a a mixer and i love to get involved."
and anne isn't.
"she's the sort of woman that likes to stop at home and watch soap operas and and gossip about this person, that person and the other person."
with her friends like you know.
"erm and when she was talking to me about different people, i'd never know who they was,because i was never i was never that interested in  bay to er to find out who they was or to remember she'd point out somebody and say that's so and so and then when she'd mention him a couple of days later i'd go, who's that?"
you know?
so i'd never get involved in the er in the gossipy side of  bay life.
er consequently we couldn't talk about anything.
she wasn't interested in my photography or er whatever i was involved in the centre.
and i wasn't involved in the gossip in  bay.
we didn't stop talking like but the talk just stemmed around the house and the kids and it didn't go any further than that.
"although i tried to get her interested in hobbies, she just wasn't interested so."
and i put that down to the biggest contribution.
just a lack of interest   in or .
you did express some er anxiety if i remember  when you spoke to me about erm not about not providing enough.
mhm.
for the for the family.
were you ever under any sort of direct pressure to keep the money.
keep it coming in for for whatever ?
erm it seemed to fluctuate.
there was pressure at times like er coming the start of a new season.
obviously there was new school clothes that was needed.
erm the mot pressure erm from that  for that sort of stuff was was came form me.
i felt i had to i when i went to school my father couldn't afford very much and erm i remember starting the first term of first day of the term with shoes with a big split in it.
"and the headmaster taking me on stage and showing everybody what a bad example i was, because i had shoes like crocodiles."
and that that made a big influence on me and i swore it'd never happen to my kids.
so the the biggest pressure for that type of thing came from myself.
i always made sure my daughter had new clothes to go to school with like you know.
not just  but in in good order all the way through the year.
"so consequently at times there would be er periods of stress for myself, where i just had to get enough money to give my daughter some new clothes like you know."
and then there'd be clothes for anne.
"anne liked to feel that er although she wasn't a teenager any more, that she was smartly dressed the other women in  bay like you know."
myself i never worried about i was one of the biggest scruffs you've ever seen in your life actually.
erm looking back on the photographs.
"that was taken in the last few years, er i i i've never bothered about clothes in my entire life."
what i look like.
"since i since i left school and i was able to afford my own clothes and i  knew that erm a responsibility for my own clothing was on my my own shoulders, it has never bothered me since, for myself."
but it always bothers me for other people like you know.
erm but no real stress.
"once anne had accepted the fact that i wasn't gonna work in the foreseeable future, and it was her choice that we stay, cos i gave her a clear choice, it was either move away where i could get work, or stay and suffer the wages of the dole like you know."
"and once she'd made the choice that she wanted to stay, the consequences were as far as money were concerned, well that was it."
"i didn't worry about that too much except just these periods when say a bill'd come in or clothes were needed, something like that."
how did you solve the problem then of er.
of providing.
erm  a lot of it was working on the side.
er that is what you call the black economy yeah?
yeah.
er when it was needed it it was always needed in a hurry.
"although we had we had warning that erm obviously that you knew the kids were gonna start a new season in september, you'd start saving the money and a bill would come up."
"something would come up, you'd need the money."
"now i think i told you last time that er the whole time me and anne had been together, we're not drinkers."
it's very rare we go out.
we both smoke but er i smoke roll your own cigarettes and i and half an ounce lasts me a week.
"so it's not a big expense like you know we weren't spending the money on ourselves, it's just needed in the house and needed for the kids like you know."
erm we didn't waste money in any way.
"but when it when a bill came up and it would take away the money that we'd saved for kelly's new school uniform, so it always seemed to come in a rush and there was always something needed like you know."
"like next week you had a week or whatever, and then i'd just go out and er ask me friends who's hiring whatever."
"i've done everything from working on a building site for a week and promising to bring me cards in and giving a false name, to er potato picking erm doing hay, anything."
there's a lot of it around there's  people just a lot of people these days see  the working on the side is a necessity.
and it' not just the people who are on the dole but the employers too.
"the local farmers erm, building site contractors."
they see it as a necessity.
"i was talking to a guy here now, erm who comes to the centre, about er two weeks ago."
"and he'd he'd been on the dole er i think two years, and he's just started up a a building site."
"a contracting business, and he's done it by the skin of his teeth."
but he's done it he's sold his he's mortgaged his house the hilt and everything.
and he won't employ  he won't employ full time workers.
he takes somebody and gives them the work on the side.
and he doesn't pay them any less than he pays a qualified man.
than he would pay a qualified man.
he just won't do it.
he says the guys on the dole need need the work.
"he says, i'll give it to them."
i see.
but he won't take anyone on full time for the simple fact that just takes one guy off the dole and and makes his life good.
"whereas, taking him taking one guy a week for a week, is putting no-one in jeopardy and giving somebody a decent wage for a week."
"he says, i'd rather do that."
so when when you use the word necessary.
yeah.
you meant that they thought it was a good thing to do.
yes?
"erm  not a not a a good thing to do when i when i said necessary,without it a lot of people would er i don't know er aggravate i don't want to make it say more drastic than it is."
"but myself, i'd have had to send my daughter to school on one occasion with a tatty uniform."
and by working on the side which i say as very necessary to get her that uniform.
"it wouldn't have made any difference to my daughter's , but it made a hell of a difference to her erm her social standing."
to the other kids.
which is a major thing.
"this impression that i got or er erm  that incident at school, played such a big part in my life after that, i was mortally embarrassed for the rest of my school life."
by that one thing.
everybody knew that incident.
everybody used to call me crocodile.
and it stayed with me right until i left school.
i changed school halfway through.
erm our school was pulled down and three schools amalgamated into one big comprehensive.
and before the end of the first term everyone knew me as crocodile.
even the other two schools you know.
so  it's a thing that stayed with me for a long time.
and that made a big difference to my life.
"erm to my self respect and i just i was determined that it wasn't going to happen to my daughter, so in consequence i saw that working on the side to get to get the uniform she could go to school in a new uniform same as all the other kids as a necessity."
er it wasn't a a good thing it was just necessary.
and a lot of people that i've spoken to who've had problems have turned to that alternative because they could see no other.
"if i'd have gone to the to the social services or er the d h s s and says to them, my daughter's got to have a new uniform to go to school with because her self respect is gonna suffer if she doesn't, they wouldn't have given be nothing."
"they'd have just turned round and says, well we can't help that, i'm sorry."
so i just went i knew i did the only thing that i knew i could do.
and that's work on the side and hope to get away with it.
"and touch wood, i've never been caught."
you said that  in the nature of things you've always needed the money almost yesterday.
yeah.
erm so you have to get work fairly quickly.
yeah.
"when you er i mean you're in that er situation, how do you cope with the idea that you need the money, you need the job, but you've got to somehow sell yourself and get employed on the best terms?"
yeah.
well obviously you compromise.
erm  the most important thing was getting the money.
so you didn't haggle.
.
if a guy i mean i've worked for farmers i i actually worked for a farmer once from seven o'clock in the morning till nine o'clock at night for five quid.
"and that wasn't the first day, that was eight days er eight days solid from sunday to the monday following monday."
and i worked for him for five pound a day because we needed the money.
and there was nothing else going.
and that guy took advantage.
he knew i needed the money and he knew he'd got me for for a he'd have got me up at six o'clock in the morning if he'd have needed me.
no problem .
i was actually living on his farm at the time.
"and he he used to get me up at seven o'clock, come to work for him."
he used to get me up at six to go in work for seven.
and if he'd have needed me at six he'd have got me up at five.
he used to give me an hours warning and then we'd work through until it got dark out in the fields and then we'd go into the sheds and restack the hay or whatever he wanted to do.
and he'd make sure he used me till about nine o'clock.
he just knew he had cheap labour.
i couldn't argue with that.
there was nobody else to turn to.
you know there was there was no other work going at that time.
"so i just put up with it, and worked it."
and we got the money.
"was there ever a moment when you when you were striking the  bargain  if one could call it that,."
mm.
when you when you knew that he'd got you by the short and curlies?
oh yeah.
definitely.
all the time.
you knew that he knew that.
oh yeah  it was so obvious yeah.
erm   this guy that i was working for he's er he he was quite well known for it in the area.
erm  that he he he he knew that you needed the work.
and consequently that's why he only i mean i'm talking now about  oh about four years ago.
"which is erm no i'm talking four years ago, i'm talking three years ago maybe."
"and all the other farmers were paying the guys who were working for them on the side, ten pound a day, for working from nine o'clock in the morning till about five at night."
"and yet this guy was paying me er half that for nearly twice as many hours, yeah."
erm he just knew it and he was well known for it.
he he was the last resort of anybody i knew.
"but if they needed it, they knew they could always get work with him."
the guy was taking on ten people at he he had ten people working for him in one day.
all at five pound a day.
and all working long hours.
i've never heard of anyone working the hours i worked but then again i was living there and that was my disadvantage.
he could get me any time.
"and he knew i didn't have to be home for the kids or whatever, he knew my circumstances so well and he knew exactly how much he could use me you know."
and he wouldn't let me go at nine o'clock if he thought i hadn't have been knackered and ready to fall down you know.
he'd have kept me there longer than that.
so in fact he knew that he was known as the last resort.
i'm i'm not so sure that he knew he was known as the last resort.
ah.
but he knew he was well known for knowing that he'd got you.
"and when when you come to him, you were desperate for work."
"so he he probably did realize that he was he was the last resort, but i don't think he was the he was the type to actually think that out you know."
he just saw you as cheap labour and that was the end of it.
i don't think he actually thought about it.
otherwise he his conscience would have bothered him i think.
he was a terrible guy.
"since i saw you last, has your has your girls gone to secondary school?"
no.
she's still in er still in the small school.
mhm.
"erm what other means did you use to ensure that there was this you know, the family circumstances were kept par?"
erm well we sold things.
did you?
"yeah, we've had to sell things now and again."
another extreme last resort.
and that was the extreme last resort.
"erm oh god, she sold the wedding rings."
but that was quite early in the marriage that was.
erm  we've sold endless tape recorders and hi fi's.
"you name it, we've sold it."
we've had to.
and then we've basically the only two the only thing i haven't turned is crime.
if you don't call working on the side as a crime which i don't.
erm i've never turned to stealing.
it's been uppermost in my mind a few times but the  i daresay i wouldn't go to prison the first time.
but you'd to me you don't you don't turn to stealing to do it for a one off.
"if you're gonna turn to stealing, then from then on it's gonna be not the last resort any more, it's gonna be one of the first resorts because it pays so much quicker."
"and in in the circumstances i'm talking about where i would work on the side, then it's always gonna be erm turning to the quickest resort, the last resort you know."
"so stealing being a quick resort, you'd i'd i i know for a fact i'd find myself turning to it firstly and not lastly."
which is wrong and i'll end up in prison.
and that's where i  don't want to be .
and i've never wanted to be.
although i have been there myself.
"but not for stealing, for erm something else."
so er i can't think of any other resorts i've turned to.
you.
no.
"you you talk er you know, when you were saying that you'd erm you'd sold an endless succession of of things,when you bought things, er you know when when you were married,was there always that element in it that it was here for a just."
a short while.
a short while?
"that that used to be mentioned between us er er a few times, i can remember it being mentioned a few times."
i wonder how long we'll have this one.
erm  er  i think it wasn't really a problem.
erm it it could have been a problem if we'd have both been so materialistic that we wanted to keep everything we'd got hold of you know.
but  we knew that it was probably inevitable.
"but we knew that also that erm if it had to go, i t had to go."
"if it was necessary then it would go, same as everything else."
everything else would go too.
"erm but one thing i would say, is that erm  we didn't go into long term erm debt to get things like three pieces and and bedroom suite and things like this."
"i suppose we could have pushed ourselves and got these things, but i think we both knew that erm if we did, we'd probably have to sell them halfway through paying for them."
"and end up the same circumstances we was now, er with out the stuff that we'd we were paying for for the next six months of the year."
"so this was mentioned in fact, i think at one stage."
we had so many conversations about about economy and all this er can't really remember.
i think it was mentioned once.
"when er when the time came that you decided that er you and your tape recorders whatever, had to part company, how do you how would you go about trying to get the best price for them?"
.
erm i don't think it was it was that difficult actually.
"er being on the dole and having friends who were long term on the dole, we tend to buy from a lot."
ah.
"so all you'd do is you'd cast about for a friend, you'd decide on a price that you would accept and if it was a friend, if you had to sell it and you needed fifteen quid to buy a pair of shoes or whatever, erm and you'd like twenty, you'd turn to a mate and go, have you got twenty quid? and he'd say yes or no."
"if he says yes, then he's holding the tape recorder, if he said no, you'd say, have you got fifteen?"
and er he'd maybe say yes and he'd get it for fifteen you know.
but i've always had ten friends who are long term unemployed and we've always bought 's stuff.
you know he i've even bought my own er no it was a wireless.
i had erm an eight er eight band wireless which i bought for a hundred and twenty quid when i was working.
erm when i first came out the army.
paid a hundred and twenty pound for it.
"i sold it once when i was skint for fifty quid, that was before i was married."
erm and while i was married i bought it back for twenty and a few months later i sell it for ten pound.
to the same guy that i'd bought it for er for twenty off.
mm.
so you know.
and he'd bought it off his friend who'd paid fifty for it.
so i couldn't i couldn't charge him twenty cos he'd only charged me he'd only charged me twenty so i had to sell him back to him for a tenner you know.
but er this hundred and twenty pound  radio  was knocking away for a five quid in the end er i er i heard.
and it was an it was an excellent radio.
it really was an excellent radio.
that's just the way it goes you know.
so er  there was er a market for  there was a market for all this?
yes definitely.
amongst er really a a small group a relatively small group.
"yeah, erm er some some you'd sold it to you might have other friends who you didn't have as friends."
yeah.
so it would slip the group.
right.
you know.
erm  but like i say er i'd have always had about ten friends who i would buy things off and they would buy things off me and they're all on the dole.
it's very rare you you'll find actually somebody who's working who would who would buy these things off somebody unemployed because they'd expect too much off them.
you know?
"er like if i was selling somebody who was employed, i erm i had a radio, if i was willing to accept twenty pounds off a friend of mine who was unemployed, i'd expect thirty of a guy who was working."
i wouldn't charge i i i'd try and get as much as i could off him cos he was working.
and he'd know that and he he probably wouldn't buy it off me.
because he knows that somebody else has has been offered it for twenty quid .
or it will go for twenty quid in the end if he doesn't buy it.
so he won't buy it.
that's what i've always found anyway.
so when it came to  i haven't really asked you whether you found the process of selling painful.
but i just assumed that it was.
yeah?
not .
wasn't it?
never never been that attached.
no?
"to things materialistic, no."
"do you think the blow it was in selling something, was it would it have been softened because you there was a you knew the people you were selling to."
i mean if you had to take it along to a shop and.
erm  that's it is it's a funny question that because i've never never liked selling to shops.
i've always much preferred to sell it to friends.
erm so i suppose you could be right.
i suppose you could be right and i was feeling an er an actual blow but not something i've ever thought about or never put into words like you know.
i've never actually thought about that.
i couldn't really have done it.
it's not something i would have considered.
i've always i've always felt  if i thought it was necessary then that's the end of it er as far as i know.
er i haven't realized any any feelings of erm you know er sadness over selling it or anything like that.
it's always just been necessary and  there it goes you know.
so you could be right i don't know.
i don't really know.
erm when you er had to stock up again  how would you do that?
where would they come from?
"erm usually, new."
we'd buy new.
we'd sold it for a ridiculously low.
"when we were flush again and we could afford something, you'd get it from a catalogue or whatever."
erm  we'd just buy new i suppose.
"but occasionally well not occasionally but quite often, once or twice a week, you'd hear of somebody who is in the thieving business, they'd got something for sale and you could get that quite cheap."
and that was another source of stuff.
"erm that might have been as well another reason for selling to friends,erm because most of the stuff we bought anyway was new so that doesn't really come into it."
"but if it was hot, or semi hot, we used to sell it to friends anyway, we wouldn't sell it to a shop."
cos the same thing still apply because most of the stuff was new but we had  of hot stuff over the years like.
which is another  another for of necessity.
er as i see it.
i'd never turn anyone in that turned to stealing.
"unless , they stole from people i know didn't deserve it."
mostly shops and not as  easy targets or not as deserving targets but just as targets.
if they started pinching from old people and things like that.
erm were you under any er any any pressure to accept  erm goods that had been acquired by indirect roots?
erm.
no.
you weren't ?
no.
i mean they there was a fact that they knew you were  unemployed er or wasn't in any you were yourself a target.
yeah.
erm i wasn't aware of it.
i wasn't aware of it ever.
i'd just be offered same as most of my friends and other people that are were offered.
mhm.
and you you had a chance to say yes or no.
"if you said no, that was the end of it."
erm  the only thing i've i've never considered buying hot is camera gear.
er because the i say photography is er something i'm gonna continue with and if i start buying hot gear then i can't use my equipment where and when i'd want to.
you have to be careful where you're taking it and all the rest of it.
so er i've never considered that.
"i've found myself under pressure to say yes, when somebody's brought along a nice new spanking camera and er i just couldn't accept it."
but no-one's ever put me under pressure.
not that i'm aware of anyway.
"you er last time i saw you, you were  i didn't know whether you'd been starting up in er in photography but you had been  next door i think or  i'd seen a lot of your stuff."
yeah.
but you you you you you were getting into it and you had high hopes for developing your work.
"that's right yeah, i was also er doing a bit for a guy in  at the time."
erm  things didn't work out that way because  he found he was er could do cheaper himself.
well not so much cheaper cos i was most of the time i was doing it for nothing anyway.
erm he got his own interest er and in the end he decided on all his own stuff like you know.
"i i suppose it was cheaper in a way because erm he found himself in the shop more, he couldn't afford the staff that he had, he had used to have two people working for him."
he had to let one go so he was in the shop a lot himself.
and there wasn't really enough work for two people.
erm so he set up the corner as a darkroom and started doing playing about with his with his own black and white printing.
so er i fell off with that one.
"erm i lost interest in photography er after a while because the er  the photography at the centre, there's always been ever since i joined, there's been six of us who had er a a lasting thing with photography."
"there'd be other people come and had we'd show them round the darkroom and teach them how to print, how to take pictures, and they knew how to do that, they'd fall off and go away."
"and we we tried to start up well i tried to start up erm a sort of self help workshop where we all we got materials off the centre, they supplied the materials."
"we went out, we took photographs, we come back, we printed them up and we helped to learn more techniques and whatever."
we all read books and passed on what we learnt to the others.
"there was only  two of us  that showed any interest in that and that was the guy that was working here, he was running the photography and myself."
the rest of them just didn't put anything into it .
and er i just lost interest all together and stopped doing it.
"i was i used to come up here every week anyway, cos i had friends here but erm i never er i didn't take pictures for months and months and months."
really fell off.
and it's only just just lately since i split with the wife er i took a couple of months to sort myself out.
"cos although it was an amicable split, i still needed time to settle down and get used to the fact that i was on my own again."
erm  kids.
and sort out which direction i was going.
"and after i got the job at the centre, erm that took up a lot of time for er a few weeks till i settled down."
"and then i i realized that the job was only gonna last a year, cos it's only a year job, so the best thing i can do is to go  all out for what i wanna do when i leave the centre."
so i'm using every resource i can at the centre to push my photography at the moment.
"hoping that by august next year, something'll come of this photography and i can walk straight  into a maybe go to a college or if that isn't on the cards, into some sort of a technical lab or something."
something that'll keep me going in photography anyway.
i don't think i'm good enough to set up on my own.
i don't know what august will bring but i don't think so.
but at the moment i'm really pushing on the er erm portrait photography cos i'm quite good at that.
see what that see what comes of that.
you you you said that you're using every resource.
mhm.
within the centre.
how.
yeah.
yeah .
"erm what i'm doing basically is er putting on as many exhibitions as i can using the centre's name and making sure that i've got a good amount of my work in there, although i don't push anybody else out."
"they don't really contribute as much as they could, so that leaves me with an awful lot of space."
so i push as much of my stuff over as i can.
erm  i used the centre's resources like the phones and that for phoning round.
"er the various exhibition places asking about that, and making sure they all know my name."
"i write them letters, i get people to send er like photo gallery in cardiff, erm i rang them up, they were sending us stuff and it was addressed to a woman that used to be in the er activities officer about three years ago."
"or even four years ago, four years ago."
"and nobody bothered changing it, because the stuff's still coming in anyway, nobody's changed the name."
"so i rang up and changed the name to my name the women who runs photo gallery in cardiff, now knows that ken  runs the photography group in holyhead, so she knows my name now."
"and she rang up here when when they offered us the space, she rang up here and asked for me."
"which is a step in the right direction, she knows my name."
so that's that's the sort of thing i'm doing.
"and the place is used erm like the local trade's council meet here, and i make sure that i open up for them."
cos they meet on an evening that we're not used.
"the centre's not used like next wednesday, they're coming here."
"and i make sure that i'm here and i open up for them, and i make them a cup of tea."
"so the local trade's council all know me and i think they all like me , so."
anyway i can push myself forward with the local people and anybody with anything to do with photography.
that's what i do.
using everything i can get.
i've also i forgot to mention when you said has anything happened to you?
i also have done some work for the local papers .
i was at one time er the printer not the photographer but the printer for erm a free hand out paper called the islander.
i used to do all their printing for them for their photographers..
just needs to be erm  back again.
yeah i was doing their printing for them and er i've also taken a few shots for the chronicle.
and one or two for the mail.
erm way as well like you know.
"you said that erm photo gallery, is it in in in cardiff,."
yes.
had allocated you some space.
that's right yeah.
.
is it a is it a prestigious.
"yeah it's very prestigious actually erm er a local photographer who was helping us to run the er the photography workshop we call it, not a class because we we we don't teach formally, we just work together and help out."
erm he is a very good landscape photographer er in a same style as ansell adams who's his hero.
and he does very very good work.
excellent work.
"and he does twenty by sixteen prints you know, er which he tries to sell."
"he isn't selling very many, i don't know why."
erm  he wrote to photo gallery and asked them for er an exhibition date and they gave him one in nineteen ninety.
"so for them to actually come and ask for our work to be er exhibited there, is excellent."
"but it's not just erm it's not just this unemployed worker's centre, they're asking ten they want ten unemployed worker's centres throughout wales to contribute work."
but what we're doing is making sure that ours is gonna be the best there like you know.
that's what we're trying for anyway.
cos we haven't seen the rest yet.
but er that's what we're hoping for.
but it's er everybody's trying to get in there.
erm lots of new photographers exhibit there and lots of the old established photographers exhibit there.
er fay goodwin has just had one there.
oh yes.
so you know.
"and at the moment we're on the ninth of this month, i received a copy today they they sent me some material, erm they've actually been given photographs by people like er ansell adams, fay goodwin, er david er  bailey."
couldn't remember his name.
"good god, he'd never forgive me."
david bailey er they've all given prints for them to sell to help the funds out at the at the er photo gallery.
so that's how prestigious it is like you know there.
everybody uses it.
and a lot of people go there to have a look.
a lot of the photographers you know.
so it's a it's a good place to be.
no doubt about it.
so you've got the  er somehow the idea of a career has formed?
yeah.
"erm i wouldn't say it's an idea, i'd say it's a hope."
a great hope.
i'm hoping to do it.
what i what i'd really hope for is to be able to do it without having to go to college and just do it by experience but that's i'd have to be awful awful good.
especially as i don't like colour and i only like black and white.
i hate colour photography.
"erm i don't just hate the thought of doing, i just i don't like colour photographs ."
they don't do anything for me .
i i love the tonal range in black and white.
"so erm i'm hoping to be able to do it, just off what i can do,my experience as it is like."
or what it will be by the time i've finished this job.
but it's it's a it's a hard field to break into.
it really is.
"and i think the most i'll get it, for a few years, is local portrait photography."
"it'll only be  after i've met a few people and photographed them well, that maybe my name will be start to be mentioned around  that is another reason for courting the trade's council and any other councillors that come in."
and any other bigwigs that come in.
i er i court them a lot.
"and when when my technique has improved, because i i've as i said, i've just started getting back into portrait photography, and i forgot a lot of what i learnt before."
"now when that's improved enough, i'm gonna start asking these councillors and that if i can take their photograph."
"and when i've done a a photograph for them, when somebody else is mentioning a photograph, you know, er to go up in the town hall or whatever, er the local mayor has just had one done  by one of the guys in the workshop, and i know for a fact i could do one that's ten times better than that."
but i haven't said so obviously.
you don't do that sort of thing.
erm  but i'm hoping that one day he'll see i know he's seen my work and i think i've got a sneaking suspicion that when he came in here he was gonna ask me to do it.
"erm but he got he got sidetracked by this guy, and they were talking and he he mentioned a photograph, and he got in like you know."
i i wouldn't swear on that but i think that's what happened.
cos he was looking at me when he come in.
"and he was moving in my direction, although i didn't know he was coming in for a photograph."
erm and it was only afterwards reflecting on it i think he was coming to me.
er cos he had seen he had seen two or three of my prints.
but he hasn't seen the rest.
"and i think that once i've taken a few of the local bigwigs, then when they want a photograph taken, my name'll get mentioned somewhere along the line and they might come to me."
you mentioned going to college or or rather not going to college.
mm.
yeah?
erm is it something you want to avoid or or not?
"erm  i'd i'd really like the the experience and the knowledge that i could learn at college, but i'd like to take a short cut too."
i'd like to work in photography now you know erm going to college and spending four years at college.
"i don't see it as a waste of time, but i see it as erm, as may be an as a a a necessary delay."
i do see it as a delay i'm gonna learn and my technique'll improve a hundred percent.
i'm just hoping that i could learn as i'm as i'm earning you know.
well not earning but learn as i'm actually working in photography like.
"i'd like to work with with er a good photographer, go to college."
i reckon i could learn a a lot more.
i dislike i dislike the idea of learning in a in a formal class.
i like the idea of learning on the job you know.
that appeals to me a lot more.
but it's hard to do.
"you you you've er you've given  an impression that er this er this  the centre depends if you want to get a lot out of it, you've really got to work at it quite hard to er bring it anything together."
i didn't quite understand that.
missed a word there.
in the sense that er you say that you had a camera club.
yeah.
or.
aha.
"erm but it really depended, the persons who really got the stuff it was just two people in the end."
"that's true yeah, that's because the others weren't willing to to put in."
"the working at the centre i i can tell you that one of the especially being the activities officer which is what i am, one of the biggest problems with the centre, is not being able to put things on, it's getting people to be interested in them."
there's an awful lot of apathy in holyhead.
i used to say beforehand but i wasn't as totally convinced as i am now.
"i am totally convinced that the people in holyhead want you to put things on, pick them up at the door, drop them off, teach them how to do it er and drop them back again."
and that's the only way they consider going.
we've had to cancel five classes that we set up erm in november.
five different classes we had to cancel because nobody turned up.
er one of them i was running myself which is on on maintenance.
er which is a something that a lot of people mention to me.
"you know, er, oh i wish i could learn how to change a put on a plug properly."
or change a fuse or mend a chair.
whatever.
"so i've done all this, i'm quite a handyman in the house, so we talked about it at the at the centre here and we actually asked another guy to do it, who's erm sixty odd and he comes in here everyday er and he was willing to to start it or to run it."
"and we was gonna when we saw the interest, when the when it was proved there was enough people coming, we were gonna buy him the tools for that, to do the job properly."
"erm, the buy who was gonna do it, unfortunately has eye trouble and er towards the beginning of the start, quite the start his er eye trouble picked up more."
"and he he couldn't do it, he couldn't concentrate."
"so i took it over, no problem ."
"and i was running it and the first week i got there, and one guy turned up."
and he turned up because he turns up for everything.
it us you know .
so  i taught him how to change a fuse.
it took me two hours to to teach him how to change a fuse and erm wasn't only how to change a fuse but the correct fuse for the the correct appliance like you know.
"so i taught him that the first week, and the second week we went back and there was still only him, so i taught him how to rewire a plug how to do it properly and er went back a third week and he was still the only one there, so we went through it again, see if he'd picked it up and he hadn't so."
now he can he can actually wire a plug properly.
which is a godsend.
"because the way he was  wiring them to start with, would have killed somebody in the end ."
so he got something it but he was the only one that ever turned up.
and i went there four weeks.
and nobody turned up for it.
and yet er quite a lot of people had mentioned it and it was well advertised.
one of my jobs here is to erm is to sell the centre in a sense.
"and we use newspapers, we don't use the television because we can't get on it."
"er i actually make, whichever comes up, i make a poster for it, and i blitz the town with them."
"there's hardly a shop ion holyhead you can go into which hasn't got one of my posters in it, for something or other like you know."
and usually for all of them.
which is a lot of posters.
erm  and just people just they just won't come.
they just don't like to get involved in something which is ongoing for a few weeks you know.
the main thing seems to be sport.
"the young guys will come for the sport, the young unemployed."
"erm but if this trend continues, i can see them shooting down the activities side of this this place and just using it as an advice centre."
cos there's already a a a sport's centre.
and er .
"and if we're doing the same thing, they're gonna sooner of later they're gonna click and they're gonna say, well you know, that's too much of a good thing like you know."
"shut one of them down, it'll probably be us."
see it coming.
it's a terrible place this.
you've erm  you've you've indicated that er you you used the word apathy.
is i mean do you think it the fact that there is it is an area of high unemployment has anything to do with it ?
erm i really don't know.
i couldn't say actually.
it's  it's something i've obviously thought a lot about.
because my job depends on it.
my job depends on getting them in here.
"the more people i get in and get involved in classes, the better it's gonna look at the end of the year."
erm i've obviously though about it quite a lot and i can't figure out a reason for it.
"i can't say that it's high unemployment i don't know, what's unemployment got to do with it."
if they've got free time .
yeah.
"if people are gonna sit around the house while they're unemployed, they're probably the same people who sit around the house when they're on a saturday and sunday when they're working you know."
they just don't do anything with a saturday and sunday.
"i've known loads of people who who are working full time, and they come home friday and the go out friday night, stand up at the bar, and drink twenty pints or whatever, ten pints."
and they they they go home and they don't move out the house until monday morning.
terrible people.
i don't know i just can't understand  what drives these people .
i couldn't live an existence like that.
i've got to get something life.
"you know besides the fact that i wanna work when i'm when i'm not working, i still like to to get out the house and get involved in something."
otherwise you there's no point.
"i i couldn't i couldn't go to work monday and friday, monday to friday and then spend all the weekend in the house and then just go to work monday to friday again, and do that week in and week out."
there's i can't see what's in life for em .
it's terrible.
but that's seems to be what a lot of the people round here do.
"i know for a fact my my own brother, and i mentioned this before, the last interview."
he spent seven years just sitting on his backside in the house.
and he ruled his house with a rod of iron you know.
"every decision that was made in the house was his, his wife had no say in it."
"er he said what was gonna be cooked for tea, he said when there was a cup of tea made."
his house was in his entire kingdom.
and he didn't want anything else.
for seven years he didn't want anything else.
and then he moved to holyhead.
"erm and he started coming to this centre  he he came to the centre once or twice with  my other brother for some advice i think, welfare right advice."
"and then he bought a computer  to use in the house, nowhere else like,it was still his house was his kingdom."
and he found he couldn't handle it.
"so hearing there was computer classes here, he started coming and he didn't like it and he stopped."
"and then after a couple of weeks he still couldn't get on with his computer, so he came back."
"and he stayed, and now he drops in here most days of the week and he practically runs the computer class in there."
and he actually mixes with people which is something he's never done.
that guy has never mixed with people and yet now he just he mixes with everybody .
so this this centre has actually changed his life.
and his attitude a hell of a lot.
but like i say for seven years he just sat and didn't want to do nothing.
and a lot of people are like that.
has the has the centre in any sense  erm  political linkings?
"erm   again that's a hard question because i'm thoroughly non-political, absolutely non-political."
"erm i know for a fact that peter  who who's the supervisor erm is a staunch labourite and er union man, same as geoff  but neither of them push it."
"er the centre's supposed to be totally non-political and if it ever got political, they'd close us down."
"the same as they did with the one in bangor, they closed that down for being political."
er some of the comments  political i suppose yeah.
but there's no erm there's no sort of political influence .
that i can see.
"but me being me, i could miss it."
because it goes straight over my head anyway.
if it was subtle.
"unless it was out and out  screaming, let's kill thatcher, i wouldn't even notice it i don't think."
so you're asking the wrong person i'm afraid for that one.
you you'd have to be very er very hard line for me to notice it.
ah yes.
yeah i'll have to go.
thank you very much ken.
excellent.
well i hope i've been of some help.
yes you have indeed.
hello.
pinching .
"erm, it's about my back today."
aha.
"it's  for a, a couple of weeks there it wasn't too bad, but now i feel it's ."
what did you do to it?
"it doesn't look bruised, mind, but it feels, sore to touch or anything?"
"i, i really don't know what i've done."
"i know times i get it, like  maybe just at one side, if i've been sitting in a hard seat."
mhm.
"at a, a particular wee bit if i've been leaning back,."
aye.
"you know, but."
but this is all over?
right.
it's just there isn't any bruising.
and there's nothing to see?
"you know, i've i've, well i've looked."
the best i can.
mhm.
"and i cannae see any bruising, but  it feels."
it feels all bruised.
it's all bruised.
and in.
and and nothing you can think of that started it up?
and it's sore like  nerves.
like.
pins and needles?
you know how if you hit your elbow?
aha right.
or er  you know into my finger.
into your fingers.
"you know when i, when i go to lift something, or if i use."
mhm.
"pressing on this finger,."
"aye, it feels numb."
right up.
right up the arm.
right.
this arm.
right.
"er your hand doesn't get swollen or anything like that cathy, no?"
you've not seen anything?
"no, i don't think it's been."
nothing .
swollen or anything.
right.
right in into my wrist.
right through?
right.
aye.
what about your elbow?
"aye, my elbow."
right your elbow.
not so bad at the top.
mhm.
more down at the bottom.
painful down.
right.
from my finger up.
"now,are you on anything in the way of tablets that could be upsetting your, your system  ?"
"i just got two  two bottles the last time i was in, i can't ."
nothing?
and was one of them not for that and my neck?
mhm.
that's.
yeah.
still sore.
still sore?
right.
mhm.
right.
and an odd time.
it goes really.
right.
"i feel it's really deep,."
mhm.
"deep, deep."
and then it calms down a wee bit.
"then it calms down, right."
there's nothing in that that would cause this problem.
is this a sort of neuralgia.
just.
yeah.
you know a kind of painkiller i'm taking.
"no , it's  er, no this tingling down to your fingers, that's a different thing catherine."
"erm, right."
is it the same thing?
"aye, it's the same thing down your back."
yeah.
"coming down my back maybe, and."
"now the one thing you'll have to watch  excuse me  excuse me, with these tablets, is anything with alcohol in it."
it's liable to make you sick.
mhm.
if you mix the two.
and.
i've been feeling a wee bit sick.
yeah.
just this.
that's right.
"like, well, the wee'un's not too good, she's loaded with the cold and  sore throat, and been a wee bit sick, too."
but today.
yeah.
i've been feeling a wee bit.
yeah.
"i had something to eat earlier on, and i felt awfully."
just.
sicky.
i was going to be sick.
watch your  watch your tummy with this  stuff.
"it's good, but it's  you know, it'll fight  er with anything, any sort of beer or whisky or any of these things, but it'll also fight with cough bottles."
er and tonic bottles.
because nearly all of them have a very small amount in.
"so, if you're on anything like that , forget it."
leave it off just now cathy.
and what about the.
till i get you sorted.
tagamet and things?
is that okay?
that's okay.
tagamet's fine.
no problem there.
the inhalers?
ventolin isn't a problem.
"aye, it's only alcohol and things with alcohol in, that you need to watch cathy."
and can you give me.
okay? and that.
some tagamet and ventolin?
mhm.

yes.
but i haven't managed to do it yet.
that's okay.
that's no problem.
"erm  should i, should i wait till the pain's."
"first, first time you get a chance."
really really bad or anything before i go?
no?
just any time?
no no.
no no.
"just first time you get a chance, you go over and get them to x-ray it, and they'll see if there's any damage at the back there."
to try and find out what's going on.
turn you into a human being.
you're not kidding .
that's what it feels like.
well.
especially with the wee one being.
"well,."
"ill, i mean."
well.
"she's up all night,."
turn you turn you into a human being.
"you cannae be upset with her, because she hasn't ."
she can't help it.
she can't.
"aye well, you look after her, that's the main thing."
keep her right.

.
"i'm only needing the lazarite and er aspirin,."
"lazarite what about your spray, walter?"
no?
no i'm alright for that.
i'm okay for .
you're alright for your spray.
so that's  i am due my line too.
fine.
is that ?
aye.
"are you still  gardens, yeah?"
yes.
"there you are young walter, and that'll keep you  for a week ."
doctor.
right.
cheerio now.
"this is oral history project tape number two of mr melville , of eleven, close, ipswich in suffolk."
"my name is joyce , the date is the twentieth of august, nineteen eighty seven."
this is interview number six of the fire brigade.
so you put another story on at  road?
"yes, so that became the  the fire prevention suite, erm  and erm still is the fire prevention suite, erm and is well used now again, almost bursting, i should think er with increasing staff and, and work which seems to come each year."
"when you talk about fire prevention, what do you actually mean?"
"yep, well, i mean the objective of fire prevention is to, is to try and make places safer and to alert people to erm to the risks and dangers of fire, before it happens,that's, the objective is to er try and stop fires happening."
"some of it is done by legislation which erm fire officers have to erm put to use er and, and work to erm and then there's a lot of good will advice and, and help that can be given, er and publicity and training which comes under the big wing of fire prevention."
"i think they call it fire safety now, in my time it was fire prevention but now fire safety which is probably a better word for it."
"er so, that task, much of it under legislation, is carried out by fire officers and much of it as i say by good will and erm er advice to householders and bodies and erm big concerns ."
does that mean visiting their premises?
"yep, yep erm these officers are all trained in, in fire prevention work erm at the fire service's technical college at morton marsh, and er they practise those skills they learn there over many years erm i'm looking back, i mean the time that i spent in training schools and er and in, in the job er i suppose when you total it all up it must be two or three years home really, er in courses you know, in my day we went away on fire prevention training classes six months, six months' course was the, so you went away to the fire service college which in those days was at dorking, a lovely place in dorking, and you did six months there solid, and then nowadays about thirteen weeks, the courses run about thirteen weeks, and you are constantly fire, fire officers from the ranks of erm probably a sub officer, leading fireman in some places, but sub officer onwards and particularly station officer the more senior ranks are away on courses regularly for, it's really updating people erm new legislation coming in, new techniques coming in, erm which have to be  these people have to be updated so they are very well trained, erm more so than most local authority people i would think, fire, fire officers are, erm purely because the job is such a wide range of, of things to deal with."
that's changed over the years hasn't it?
"oh it's changed no end erm  particularly the fire safety and firing, fire prevention angle has changed erm the operational side has changed in as much the things are more complicated nowadays  buildings are more complicated erm fire losses are greater erm."
fire losses?
"you know  as the result of a fire the, the amount of money and goods that er are destroyed in the fire erm chemicals erm have come on the scene which bring with it their own particular dangers and risks from fire and from erm from the toxic effects of chemicals and the endanger to the environment."
"was this a new area for you when you came to suffolk because we have the docks close by, chemicals coming in there and at felixstowe,."
yep.
this is an area probably that was new to you?
"it was erm it's the first time that i'd come across, i mean i'd been a little bit of experience on, on inland waterways in windsor er which i'd lost when i went to leicester and lincoln  i came back here and now we had the north sea and the docks and erm that was a new area and a, and a really good challenge erm i particularly got involved with, with things like erm the movement of chemicals which was beginning to increase and coming into felixstowe and, and er and, and er ipswich erm and when i think back  felixstowe dock, looking back, ended where the big jumbo tank, the calor gas tank is, that, that was the sort of range of felixstowe dock in those days."
"look at it now, it's gone right the way back now, with all that land being reclaimed and warehousing and you name it and docks, new docks, so  in the past ten years, what a massive development that has become."
they wanted to come back even further didn't they?
they did.
recently.
"yes, they did, but that's a massive development, and with it, , the new motorways, you know the, the a forty five, and the a twelve and, and all the new by-passes, the traffic er is on the roads there, of all kinds, erm is 's business, plus the warehousing arrangements at felixstowe and, and ipswich."
"so, it's a busy area now and erm from a fire point of view the fire risk is, is quite, quite high now, i would've thought, not necessarily dangerously high, but certainly it's increased, gradually increased."
"so, erm i saw the change."
"did you have any, did you have any large scares with chemicals?"
yes.
in your early days.
"well, yeah er we  we had a fair amount of chemical er troubles erm mainly spillages, bad packaging, erm a few accidents erm, and very little information in those early days erm  there was a lot of nasty chemicals going around which erm very little information followed it and people were being quite seriously injured, firemen included, policemen and others were getting involved with these things, and i got myself involved quite a lot with the various bodies that deal with chemicals, like the chemical industry association, and people of that kind, trying to make things safer, and taking up cases where spillages had occurred and, and accidents had happened er to try to get to the bottom of it and try to improve the situation and er i wasn't alone, most chief officers were working that way and certainly the london fire brigade did it, did no end of work with producing, what is now commonly known as the  coding and, and a system of, of erm er marking containers of chemicals people can understand how to deal with them, that was quite an interesting area which, even now i'm now retired i still have a little hand in that with er chemicals er in my few moments i have spare i, i get involved with that side, which i enjoy."
"erm that is an area where, that and road traffic accidents which has grown considerably in, in the time that i've been in the service in more recent years, which has become more sophisticated, the equipment has become more sophisticated, the techniques have had to be developed to deal with them and firemen are becoming more expert in, in handling these er er situations with, with equipment er which is much more technical, and, and er."
how has it changed?
"well the, the risk has changed for a start i mean  with the chemicals there are so many now erm chemicals and so much of it being transported by road, the risk of that and the dangers of accidents must be increased, although legislation has brought in a number of improvements, so firemen have to be very much with that."
do they have special gear for chemicals?
"yes they have, very special gear in, in breathing apparatus and protective clothing, er which i didn't have in my early days, i mean breathing apparatus was just beginning to be used."
we're talking about  road are we?
"yep, now nowadays erm they've got the best, i mean the equipment is excellent, er it came in my time erm my predecessor's time and it's been carried on now and new developments have come in, erm and with, techniques in, not only dealing with the chemicals in, in making safe afterwards which is twice as complicated i think, you know the decontamination side, the clearing up, the protecting of the environment from toxic chemicals er which we've all heard about in newspapers, and read reports and seen it on television, these, these accidents up and down the world."
"how do you stop it getting into the environment, because if you hose it down it will wash down into the drains won't it?"
"very very difficult  you've got to take steps of blocking off drains and stopping it getting in the waterways and you, you succeed sometimes, you don't success on other times and this is why er these accidents happen where all the fish and places die and people get contaminated, cattle get contaminated, all sorts of things."
"we're very conscious of that erm and where, where we offered advice in large places where , where housing where chemicals are stored and all the precautions that are needed are provided and built in, stopping off the drains water is contained, providing sloping areas in, in the bottom of warehouses where water doesn't come out, erm monitoring it  telling people about it."
you almost need to be an architect.
"well, fire officer's training does take in a lot of architectural work, you know the safety of buildings and the way in which they're put up, the materials that are used, the strength and the strength of materials and the fire resistance of materials, all that comes into their work."
"so, it's the range of  of knowledge is quite wide, you know, from, from extricating a cat and how to do that er to, to a large modern hotel building, how to protect it from fire, so, so there's quite a lot to learn yep."
"this is why that the leaning process never ends, it's, it's always on, the new developments come in and people have to be taught, and firemen have to keep with that."
for anybody who's interested it's certainly not a boring .
"i never found it to be a boring job, erm if it is boring i think it's because they're only making it, if they make it that way and i think it's partly due, if they, if people do talk that way then i think it's partly the sort of duty systems that people work now, and erm the number of hours they work, and, and strangely for little things like the introduction of television, i think television, very nice in its way but it's killed life on fire stations and in certain areas, cos the whole business of conversation and learning has gone, people would much sooner sit nowadays the television and be entertained for an evening, using all the other skills and, and erm things that are offered to them."
do the firemen at  road still live on site when they're on duty?
"yes, oh yes, nobody leaves a fire station once they come on duty no."
"but, playing cards and talking and making their own enjoyment probably?"
"i might be biased, i think they still do that but i think erm."
the television has.
the television has made a difference.
"i think not only just at fire stations, i think in the whole of life, hasn't it?"
yes.
"er, home life has changed, i think, that."
"i'm not saying it's bad, necessarily bad, but i think it has changed something and, and it's, i, i certainly saw it when it came onto fire stations in the fifties  how life changed in the fire station."
"and er now it's accepted i suppose and young firemen joining now wouldn't, wouldn't know any different, and they'll probably be able to manage much better than i would  on a fire station."
"er i often ask what's life like, and the funny thing i've got a son in it now, i've got a son who's a station officer in, in colchester, and my daughter just married a fireman from, from  road so, so we're still involved."
keep it in the family.
"we're still involved, and they tell me that life on a fire station is still very pleasant so i'm sure it must be."
"when you were talking about the equipment changing for road traffic accidents, in what way has that changed?"
"well, first of all er  we started off with having a, an amount of fire equipment, an amount of rescue equipment carried on a particular vehicle."
and what did you have?
"er things like er  crowbars and bull croppers and er rescue ropes and lines and things of that kind, which are very very simple, stuff you would buy in a hardware shop and probably be able to manage with it."
"now things became so complicated that one of the things we did and  i think i was partly instrumental in it, was to make sure that we carried this on all fire engines, you know we used to have this one at each divisional headquarters, probably forty miles away."
"so, in the process of er  change we, we provided the basic means for cutting, lifting and pulling er on every fire engine, a little amount of, of equipment, if you had a road traffic accident you didn't, the machine that was there, now that was a great step forward."
"er we also had one very large, cumbersome machine which carried things like lighting and breathing apparatus, and heavy lifting gear and all the other bits and pieces of rescue equipment, which came along in slow time, now that has been improved upon no end, and they've got a very modern equipment now for that, erm er modern in the sense that new, new pieces have come on, cutting equipment with hydraulic jaws which er just slice through the top of a car roof, whereas we had to cut it with a hacksaw perhaps, or, or another metal saw, we, these can be done with just like cutting through cheese."
and time is the essence isn't it?
oh yes.
in an accident.
"oh yes, and, and er it's amazing those few seconds, how much they can relieve pain and suffering, if you can get people out quickly and, and take away the, the trouble from them."
could it.
so that's all progress.
could a fireman administer first aid?
"yes, they're all trained in first aid, erm erm and in the use er we also carry the analgesic gas, now the ones that er nitric oxide which is used in er pregnant mothers for childbirth, they carry some of that now, er which they administer to people in pain and that takes away the pain erm anyway, until such time as you can extricate them or, or ease the pain or take away the problem them that's causing them the pain."
"so that's a great step forward, isn't it, to, to relieve pain as quickly as that."
when did that come about?
"oh nineteen sixties we, we introduced that with the blessing of the ambulance people , it wasn't done without careful consideration, because erm we didn't want people to, to just erm introduce it without knowing what we were doing and ever since we used it it's been a great blessing."
so that's another step forward.
is this equipment carried on a normal fire tender?
"erm certainly on the rescue tenders, erm erm on, on each division would have that equipment, it's not carried on every fire engine as far as i know now, erm i, i don't see why it shouldn't but er again i think it's a matter of cost, and, and carrying it about as well and finding the space for it, but certainly it's at hand when it's needed."
"so, so that's been a great improvement i think, erm in recent years and, and in the erm early seventies we, we also went into the business of providing equipment that could be left at rescues, on site, you know it was always tying up a fire engine by taking it there and, and being tied up so we provided these things which we call demountable equipment, which we commonly call the pods and erm."
why did you call them pods?
"i don't know where the name came from it, it, it's, it's, it's simple and it seemed to work erm."
was it local?
"all it was was a box really, a box which you could get off a, a, a  machine and dump it on the ground, erm the idea came from, from er i think dustcarts really, where, where you could tip them up and, and they'd empty, and that, that was this  early thought on it er."
was it hydraulically taken up?
all hydraulically lifted yep.
with an arm.
"yep, and we developed that business here in fact in suffolk, we were the very first fire brigade to, to do it in the seventies, er our own workshops made them erm the units and are now still making them, and the ideas were original ideas on, on, on the equipment and we made about three or four in, in when i retired and i think they made several others now like canteen vans, and erm breathing apparatus, er  ."
"so there's a whole range now which requires just one prime mover to lift these pods and deposit them where they're needed, and it's been done in germany elsewhere, in fire brigades elsewhere, certainly in germany because i went and saw them there , and it's a very simple straightforward progressive sort of way of dealing with problems of the fire service."
is it a normal fire tender that takes this pod along?
"no, it, it's, it, it, it's coloured like a fire, fire, fire engine red and all the other things, but it, it's a commercial vehicle a roll-on roll-off type of vehicle, which you can buy commercially and, and adapt for fire service use, and there's erm i should think there must be about half a dozen pods now, erm at high wootton, in fact police services are using it, thames valley police i remember coming up here to, to take the idea back, erm i saw yesterday at hungerford, er the police there going with their pods to, to."
more like a cabin?
"it, it is it's, it's, you design it and you fit it up, and you can just."
pentiford.
"drop it down, in this pentiford yep, ours is filled with all sorts of gear, decontamination, you know erm after a, a chemical incidence you've got to clean yourself off without contaminating everybody else, and you can do this within a pod, it's been so designed that you can walk in one way dirty, and walk out another way clean, and."
and how do you clean up in there then?
"well there's water provided, there's showers provided, there's, there's clean air is provided, there's dirty areas and it was all well planned and segregated and, and partitioned off and curtained off and, and it does work."
what happens to the water then ?
"it's all collected into, into plastic er cans and you don't use gallons of it, you, you used enough to clean yourself off, and that's collected and then disposed of er under advice and help from the disposal, waste disposal people."
the idea is that you don't dispose of it in the drains where it can contaminate.
"so that's been another step forward i think, in the whole progression, of the fire service."
"what other changes have you seen over the, with the fire service at  road, since."
road well.
you came?
"i think communications has been the biggest change that i saw, erm  er from a system which was called the dx system, which is really a very primitive way of calling people generating electric current over some private wires, to fireman's houses and fire station."
how does it generate?
it's generated with a handle and.
wound round?
"yes, wind them round and this should, should generate a charge which rang bells and sounded bells and then er you lift up a telephone and plug in a jack and, and take a message in that way."
"erm in fact telephones, i mean talking back to nineteen forties and fifties, very few people had telephones, and it wasn't uncommon in, in those days on fire engines, where, i know at salisbury we did this, we took a bike and put it on the back of a fire engine, and if you were the youngest you were told, send the stock message back, or the informative message back, and find the telephone, and you pedalled and find the telephone, and, and you'd get told off when you came back, why you weren't quicker about taking it."
now that was the system.
"it seems incredible, doesn't it, but like it was the only practical way to do it wasn't it?"
"that's right, i mean you, you looked in, in, in, if you had a fire out in the sticks somewhere, you'd look to see where the telephone was, where if there were any, and then knock on somebody's door perhaps, at two o'clock in the morning and say can i use your telephone, and they weren't very happy sometimes i can tell you."
weren't they?
"oh, no and er."
hasn't anyone ever come unstuck?
"well,you've heard, i've heard some people being nasty and, and they didn't say no, but it was always, not always it was occasionally done grudgingly, and, and erm in many cases it was done willingly, you know come in yes please do, and, and they didn't even want the penny that, that you offered them for the telephone call."
heavy phone call.
"in the days, in those days yes, but nowadays what is it, it's er such a fantastic erm step forward really, it's all on radio, er where at the press of a button you get radio contact between headquarters and any fire engine, between any officer in the fire engine, you can call firemen by radio at their house, and at the fire station, erm i mean this is, is, is really progress and erm might be complicated, i'm sure it has its problems , but for a matter of speed er  and computers coming in with it, the whole thing now is, is very sophisticated and erm very modern, and i think that's probably been the, probably the biggest step forward here."
"we started it off in, in nineteen seventy, early seventies with an all radio system, and we were the only fire brigade in the country that started it off, called the multi-tone radio system of communications."
"er much to everybody's fear, really, because we, we, we were stepping into a new area, you can imagine from, from wires to something with no wires, and the risk of that failing, but, but it worked and er from thereon, most fire brigades have taken on the task and, and er are now on radio contact of this kind."
so suffolk was the prime area?
"oh, no doubt about it, in nineteen seventy two, seventy one seventy two we, we went out on a limb really with that, erm when all other fire brigades were using telephone systems, the suffolk and ipswich fire service went out and did that."
"i think has been the biggest, communication-wise, has been the biggest step forward  in a more erm  friendly and  er happier sort of note we, we were one of the few brigades that started a band."
"erm there was the london fire brigade which had a band, erm and the yorkshire fire brigade which had a band, but there was no brass band as such in this part of the world."
when did it start?
"it started nineteen seventy one or seventy two, it must have been, when my predecessor  and i were sat down, and we said what about a band, they all said, what band, well let's have a band, and  and it started just like that, and we, we managed to get the whole of the brigade alerted to it, and we had a meeting at headquarters, to which about forty or fifty people turned up, of which two had probably blown a  an instrument in the past, and there was enough enthusiasm to learn and we had a, a chap who was a musical teacher in town  who was would happily teach our people you see and so we went out, we had a penny, with no help from the authority or anybody else and we got every type of brass instrument for a band on tick  and we said we'd pay for it, and er."
as the fire brigade or individually?
"er well, not as a fire brigade  as, as, as individuals i suppose, we, we took the risk of, of paying for these instruments and."
on the strength of a fire brigade band?
yeah.
yeah.
"yeah, and they did, they sent us a whole vanload of, of instruments and i can remember the, the evening we, we put all these instruments in the conference room there and the gang of enthusiasts arrived and, and they said and what would you like to play?"
"some said they'd, they'd be interested in playing, they knew how to play certain things and others wanted to play others and that's how we started, and in a matter of a year the new headquarters at er lowestoft was being opened, by the dutchess of kent, and we decided that the band was going to play at that one and you can imagine, and it was all ready and they were playing music, but i'm not sure what, what quality music it was, and blow me on the week before, the band leader, the conductor decided he couldn't play because he had a sprained wrist  so we were left without a conductor even, but we managed to get another conductor and we played and i don't know what it sounded like, but the dutchess of kent was very kind, she said the music sounded lovely."
god bless her.
"and things have gone on since then and the band still plays, er they have not the easiest task of finding people, change , but er their families and friends and, and even some of the youngsters that learn at school that, a fireman's friends and relatives have joined the band and they play out in the parks and they, and they play in the spar pavilion and they, they provide concerts for people, and christmas times they play in the town."
that's lovely.
"and i think it's great, and it's uniformed and it's played at the opening of, of the fire service technical college at morton march, it was invited to play there with the other bands and erm before the queen, and er so it's, it's gone on, from strength to strength and we are very proud of it, we really are."
"when you said uniforms, it that fire uniforms?"
"fire uniform band, yep."
and  children in there?
how do they get.
then we get it specially made.
locally?
"yeah, we're talking about children who  you know thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, which are growing up , but we get them altered and we get them made for them, we used to get them made and er still do i think."
do you get them made locally?
"yep, yeah  all the mothers are very good , they, they, they alter them and get the uniform altered and fit so they look very smart they really do with er with the standard uniform with a little bit of embellishment on the shoulders but erm  otherwise it's the standard uniform."
"when you say standard uniform, that is a variant from another type of uniform?"
"it's the, it's the  what we would call the walking-out uniform, you know the, the undressed uniform, not the fire fighting uniform, which is really just a jacket and trousers and shirt and tie and, and the girls have a skirt and er er a tie and blouse and that sort of thing, so and a cap ."
girls.
"yes, we've got girls in the band , you know relatives of the families and, and girls that are will do work in the fire brigade, in the control room ."
"have there ever been any fire ladies, you've got firemen?"
"erm, they haven't had them in suffolk, we've had one or two try to join and one did reasonably well, but right at the end of, of the, of one of the tests, the strength tests, she failed, she couldn't quite manage it erm."
what would she have to do?
"er, well you have to carry a twelve stone man over a hundred yards, you see, in a certain time, and that is one of the strength tests, erm er these are these are tests that are drawn up to get people in in the initial stages, and then they go on from there."
"erm and she was from the pentiford area i think, erm  oh quite a well educated girl, erm there was nothing to stop them from joining, i mean the london fire brigade there are, are fire fighters who are girls, erm and the er they do very well erm there are problems , with, with women on fire stations, but nevertheless there's no reason why they shouldn't be there, providing they can do the job and i'm sure those who read the papers and see the news know that in russia and places like that, women do the, do the job very well."
erm.
but you do need that physical strength?
"there's definitely that needed and, and they seem to fall by slightly on that and in things like breathing apparatus, the wearing of that, and."
why is that?
"erm i, i think again it's, it's probably the, the feeling of wearing it in, in confined spaces that might upset women more than it does erm men i don't know."
"is it claustrophobic in, in the breathing apparatus?"
it can be i know where it has affected men even to that extent to be claustrophobic yep.
er some won't wear it erm erm have had to leave the fire service that.
oh yes.
"er it's not everybody's cup of tea that isn't, nor is indeed like climbing ladders isn't."
climbing ladders isn't everybody's cup of tea you say?
"no it isn't erm and erm  even those who in, in my experience who did get through there was just an occasional er time when they didn't pass that part of it, they, they, they, they couldn't quite manage that, the height side frightened them and er they failed, erm so there's quite a lot of demands on them and i'm sure  that a lot of women could do it and a lot of women  if they had the chance would do it or would, if they were willing to do it, but it's not something that grabs most women, i don't think it does, i think it's the physical side that puts them off, and that is what is the problem with the fire service, it is a physical job."
"erm in the early stages, i mean you've got to go through all the ranks, you've got to go through that physical side, you want to get on, there's no direct promotion into the higher ranks so you've got to go through it, every chief officer, every senior officer that you, you come across in the fire service, has started as a fireman and will start as a fireman  on like er the forces where you get direct entry into the forces, you don't get them in the fire service."
"mind you it's a good idea if you have all the practical experience, nobody can every say well you don't know, you haven't done it."
"that's right, i think that's, that's the secret of it yeah."
yeah.
"but going through all the stages, all the ranks, experiencing all the things that every other fireman under your command will experience, and you've done it."
that's right.
they do have lady clerical staff don't they?
"mm  yes most of the, most of the jobs erm anything to do with typewriting, and clerical work there's a predominance of females, yeah."
"there are one or two clerks, er that have male, purely because it's, it's their job anyway, and er the chief clerk  headquarters is a male but the majority of them now are women yep, and they do well er, headquarters staff do it very well i think, that side of it."
"i think even control room where at one stage it was a, a male domain, it is not so now there's, there's, i would think now there's a predominance of women there, erm purely i think again that control room work suits them better, they, they, they concentrate better, i think, they, they lend themselves better to that type of work and they're more dextrous with their fingers on, on these buttons and, and typewriters and, and other things."
what does the control room involve?
"well, the main control room is, it's the centre of all the communications set up on the operational side for the fire brigade."
"they take, they are the people that are every nine nine nine call that comes in."
do they go direct now?
"they go direct wherever you are in suffolk it goes into ipswich, all the calls go into ipswich."
road?
"yep, and  erm the minute the nine nine nine calls come in, the staff at the control room there deal with them er erm they record the call, they, they talk to the people, they take the message, they erm call out the fire appliance, they inform the firemen where to go, they er show them where to go if, if they can't find their way, they direct them and then they process the whole problem until the job is ended."
so that's the function of the control room.
how did they alert the firemen on at the station?
"you know, nine nine nine call comes in."
yep.
they verify that is coming from where the person says it's coming.
they then alert the firemen.
how do they alert the firemen?
"well on the, on the whole-time manned stations, that's done by pressing a button and, and an alarm is sounded, it's er a  horn, type of horn that sounds off, er that's easy enough."
"on the twenty seven part-time stations where the people are not on the station, they're at home, they're at work or elsewhere, each one carries a little alerter with them, erm tiny little gadget in his pocket, and this erm radio communication i was talking about earlier, by pressing the right button for the appropriate station, er er it triggers off these alerters and the men respond to that call, come to the fire station, where the telephone is live waiting for them and the message is passed on that way."
"in fact the latest development is that they don't even do that by picking up a telephone, the message is teleprinted on, onto a message pad there, and when they run in they pull off this pad, and there's the whole text for what they've got to do, where they've got to go, ."
so it's all done now automatically.
"the girl in headquarters types it out, and it's transmitted there, and received and that's all they do."
"so there's no, even talking if necessary, once they get onto the fire engine, they pick up the receiver then and book-on mobile which tells the control where they are going, and once at the situation then the conversation is done by, by radio telephone."
"so in the olden days before they had the, the alarm, the pager alarm."
mm.
"carried on the pocket or whatever, how did you alert these part-time firemen or the, the erm they are part-time firemen aren't they?"
"yep, well each station in those days had one of the war-time sirens on, on, situated right on the top of the tower of these fire stations, enormous great sirens with a very piercing, loud sound, erm so that was the audible warning, to tell them that they were wanted in the fire station."
"er it, it worked very well for ninety percent of the time, but there was occasions when wind direction was wrong, and the noise levels were high ."
"er or aircraft went over when the siren was going, and the people couldn't hear it."
ninety five percent of the time it worked.
"at home, when they were at home they had bells in their home, and erm by pressing the appropriate button, er an electrical charge was sent across these wires, it was private wires to these homes and the bell rang, and the bell rang all hell broke loose in these, these homes."
"i mean i've known wives er having bicycles ready in the, in the corridors of the house, where all the man had to do was to get his trousers on, if he was asleep in bed, she would come and open the front door, put him on his bike and away he went."
that was it.
"it has become more sophisticated now, there's cars waiting and, but firemen are very very like that, we train firemen, they have their gear ready, erm i'm told by, by most of the firemen that they have a chair there with their trousers on them and his shirt and his shoes and, and his car is ready in, in the drive way or his bike is ready in the driveway and, and he's away and he's, he's on a fire station in a matter of a few, few minutes."
that's good isn't it?
"oh yes, the, the service that the retain people give is unbelievable for what they get paid for, it's, it's pennies really for that service."
because they only have minutes don't they to get ?
"well there's a great pride in getting there, you see and they don't want to, it's, it's the first six who get there who get the ride anyway, and there is a difference in the amount of money they earn, slightly, by getting the ride, in other words going to the fire there  there is a slight difference in, in the payment they receive."
"not that it's much anyway, but it's, it's, there is a difference, and there is this pride of getting there, being one of the first six to get there, and there is quite a lot of competition, i can assure you."
"and er they have a go, er even day and night, and i don't know anywhere in the country that you can get that sort of service twenty four hours a day, three hundred and sixty five days a year from people who get paid that sort of money, it's, i think it's, it's a marvellous er set-up it really is."
"would it be order to ask what they do get paid, or what they did get paid?"
"oh i'm, i'm not sure, it's, it's a few hundred pounds a year and i, i, i'm really guessing it's a few hundred pounds a year for what they call a retaining fee, for being firemen, and then it's a few pounds every time they attend, and a lesser amount every time  for an, a greater amount every time they go out on the fire engine, but it's nothing er  nothing exceptionally high, it's, it's very reasonable when you think they've got other jobs to do."
that's right.
"er and other commitments that twelve men in a in a village erm pentiford or pentiford will give twenty four hours cover for fires, all through the year and there are very rarely incidents where you cannot turn out a crew."
"very, very rare indeed."
now that's marvellous i think.
"yes, so you have twelve retained firemen, and six, , have to go, there are six who go on a tender?"
"six is the maximum you can push onto, or fit on a, a fire appliance safely."
"do you have a rota system where if maybe six have got onto an appliance and there's another fire comes up in a few hours that they cannot turn ut again, or is it just a matter of whoever gets there first again?"
"i think some stations might do that, but they only do it if, if it's, if it's not going to be detrimental to the turn out, in other words they, they have a system, erm they have a duty crew over the weekend, some can take their families to the seaside if they wanted to, so six will remain around the house er er but they do have some system, but i think the majority of fire stations, there are twenty seven in suffolk like that, who work on the system of getting there as quickly as they can, and that is the best competition to get there, to get the ride."
"and, they want to go anyway, that that's another point."
cos they're very conscientious aren't they?
"oh yes, very keen, very keen."
did you have any large fires in your time at  road?
"mm, yes we had a  a reasonable number, erm  nothing  that dramatic, but you know enough flame and fire erm  to deal with."
"there was one certainly in the docks in my time where, er quite a nasty fire in the docks, one of the warehouse buildings there was, was going very well erm a ten, ten or so pump was on, on that job."
erm plenty of water everywhere and er firemen everywhere.
can you pump the dock in a situation like that?
yes you can.
"yes, the fire pumps can, can raise water thirty feet from the ground, erm  and they, they can pick up water from fire hydrants, which is situated all, all, in most streets anyway."
"so there's no shortage of water in that area, er and even in some dock areas and  dock they've got special fire mains which are pressurised, which give a lot of water at a high pressure, so you can pump from there."
"so there's no water shortage as such, sometimes you get the water problems when you get out in the sticks somewhere you'll, you, you do have problems, but all fire officers are trained to search their areas and have special cards er which they've done their research on, where the water supplies are, like ponds and lakes , and that information is readily available when they turn out these areas a fire crew going out there, your nearest water supply is a pond at  and certain area and they've got that you see."
they've got that.
"so all that's been researched and, , and so there's no time wasting as far as i ."
"occasionally you'd get er hiccups you know where you can't get down there because the ground is boggy and it takes longer, and that sort of thing but  the availability of water is, is, is pre-planned and given to you."
"and plus they take some of their own along anyway, don't they?"
they always carry four hundred gallons of water yes.
"do they still carry the same today or has, has that amount gone up?"
"no it's four hundred gallons, it's, it's, it's, they don't like to take any more than that the, the weight of water, it's quite heavy er although they have one special equipment here again one of these roll-on roll-off ones, which is a water tank equipment, and er it carries about a thousand gallons or two thousand gallons of water, er in a tank, water tank and that if you are very short of water will be sent on to boost up water supplies in a particular area, so erm that was another one of these pods that we, we designed and, and put on the run."
and you say that other counties copied these ideas from you?
"oh yes it, it spread, really has spread now quite a lot."
"they're very pleased at that because i mean they obviously found it to be useful, erm we proved it to be useful and it's nice to see them all taking on this responsibility now, now and doing it, because that's all progress."
it sounds like the fire service has come a long way from the early years.
oh yes oh yes  in my thirty odd years erm looking back now it must have been primitive in those days really .
"the uniforms were, the equipment was and yet it worked, it really worked, how efficient i suppose when you judge it from modern standards, i don't know."
"when you said the uniforms were, in what way?"
"well i mean i, i, when i joined in forty nine the, the fire uniform wasn't all that much different except they had black helmets yellow, and, and they had rubber boots and they didn't have the leggings we have, now, but the walking-out uniform was the old army battledress died blue, that's all it was."
so we were all issued with army battledress.
"i mean, nowadays you've got nice jackets and, and, , and the hats were, were stiff sort of hats with, caps rather with wire brims on them, you know and, and they, they were really flat on the top and there was no style with them or anything, it was, it was the styles of the, of the forties i suppose and, and nowadays it's so much smarter and nicer and more comfortable ."
"the battledress was very good, i mean the army seemed to wore it all that time so er we had it for several years and we had to press that every day, thick material, very heavy."
press it every day?
"well, to keep it tidy, you see the, the creases used to come out so quickly, and we had to be, well on parade you were, you were looked at and you had to be very tidy and proper and er if you didn't do it you were told to do it and that was that."
are they so strict on appearance today?
"i think there's a pride that, that the majority of firemen are, are fairly clean and smart erm there are the odd ones that have to be told but it's not the same sort of discipline now as there was, and i'm not sure whether it's right or wrong, all i see i, i enjoy the discipline when i had it, i sometimes wish it was brought back but er it's not the time now it seems for that type of discipline, so i think they manage well but er i would like to see more but perhaps i'm ."
all in all you seen like you enjoyed your time in the fire service?
"oh yes, oh yes, if i had it again i'd do it exactly again."
would you?
"no trouble , yeah, i really enjoyed thirty one good years mm."
nine?
"erm, mm,."
"yeah, have you, have you reviewed your revision to see how you're doing and how effective it is, and why it's getting you down and."
no.
"no, how."
mm.
"how is it going, just plodding."
yeah.
"you know, got more of this, more of this to do."
yeah.
"er, is there any of it that you really enjoy, or enjoy a little bit, or think oh this isn't too bad, or."
"mm,."
or don't scream at the thought of?
"i don't know, it's something, no, i'll just plod through and."
what have you been looking at in the maths.
mm.
"i've just been going through it really,the textbook."
and have you looked at some of these bits at the front to tell you how to make it more effective and.
couldn't see it.
"right, okay."
"i mean this is where it starts, with the number system, erm, do you know what any of these terms are?"
do you think it's important or interesting to know?
erm.
"people keep talking about reals and rationals, and, okay, erm."
negatives.
powers.
are you happy with negatives?
yeah.
and powers.
roots.
roots?
it's only free rationals .
rationals.
"rational and irrational, it's just a sort of, the greeks had a funny term for it, if you can express it as a fraction, think, seventy five over two hundred and ninety seven, then it's a rational number."
"if you can't, if you can't find a fraction that fits then we just say it's irrational, so can you think of a, any examples?"
get numbers that you can't express exactly?
you can't express exactly?
mhm.
like nought?
"mhm, no, you expressed that very precisely."
erm.
"what's, what's pi as a fraction?"
"three point o, as a fraction, one over three point, four."
"some people, some books say, oh take it to twenty two over seven or things like that, but it's not, and the , what you get off your calculator is only correct to however many digits you've got on your calculator,."
mhm.
"you can never, people have found pi to millions of places, and it's still, they still don't find a pattern where it repeats, so those are the irrationals anyway."
"you know what a prime number is, and we had a quick look at, we had a look at the primes that even odd, didn't we?"
"erm, why are prime , do you know what prime factors are, and why there useful?"
why are they useful?
"er,i can't remember now."
"okay, erm, if you break a number down into its prime factors, then you can look at the prime factors and see whether other numbers would go into it, so if we take say, three sixty, and find some of its prime factors."
"you won't find any sevens in there, won't be able to, does fourteen go into three sixty, you can have a look at it's a prime factors and say, well no, there isn't a seven there, erm does thirty six go into three sixty one, we're looking for something that threes and twos, appropriate number, three times three, or two times two times three times three would be thirty six, so you have at look how many twos are there in three sixty."
"oh, yeah, we can get two out, and we can get two lots of three out , so it would go in, and it's pretty obvious it would go in cos it, it's by ten."
mm.
"but, erm, some of the others are not so obvious,would divide in."
"erm, now circular measure, did you actually measure a few round things and find pi?"
"oh, i did, yeah, with you i did, yeah."
mm.
yeah.
"and you remember actually measuring it, and you know what."
yeah.
"pi means, hopefully, it means something to you now ."
"yeah, it measures the diameter, divided by the circumference."
which is.
circumference divided by.
"right which is bigger, circumference or diameter?"
circumference.
"right, and what is pi, roughly to the nearest whole number ?"
"er, about three."
about three.
yes.
"so it's got to be the long one, all the way round divided by how far across it is."
"er things like that help if you're not sure, you're thinking oh no, especially in an exam."
mm.
"well was it the diameter divided by the circumference or was it the other way round, and you right them on paper and c over d, d over c, doesn't look any different, and you get locked into the problem and you just back off a bit and think of something real, like when you measured it."
"all the way round, that's about three times across and it's got to be that way round, the all the way round, over how far across."
"relationships, similar figures, now we we looked at that, and we looked at scale, erm, and i think last time we were looking at things like though, not too long ago we were looking at price of council paper and this sort of stuff, which one shall we buy?"
shall we buy that or buy that one.
yeah.
"erm, are you happy with that?"
"erm,."
shall we have a look at it again ?
we probably want to about work again .
"right we'll have a look at that again, because once you've got it it's pretty straightforward and you can do it fairly quickly and you can do it very confidently."
mhm.
"and if you haven't got it you could be there all day on the exam, urgh urgh, and also you're thinking i'll put it this way up, that one over that."
mm.
"okay, so we'll have a look at that and, obtaining money, well."
"it's easy, you just say i'm the government, give me your money,."
mm.
"have a poll tax, and let's have fifty v a t, why, make it a hundred and then it's easy for people to calculate."
"ha, yeah."
"if you go and buy a a t v for a hundred and fifty pounds they'd say thank you, a hundred and fifty pounds, plus vat at a hundred is another hundred and fifty to go to the government."
mm.
"so, yeah."
now what about doing percentages?
"like vat , are you okay on that ?"
"yeah, yeah, i'm okay ."
"good, good, because that that comes up all the time."
geometry.
"lines angles and intersections, you were good at that, you were using your compass and doing things okay, and geometry of the circle, i, as i say tend tend to leave that with all the."
i think i'm alright on actually .
"that entails, there's thirteen or so circle , transformations comes up quite."
mm.
"and solids and nets, they tend to turn up, right, and what about sets?"
that's.
yeah.
statistics and probability.
"i think i'm alright, because we have covered that all haven't we?"
"with special probabilities, we've covered that."
yeah.
well.
"so you can, what what i'm thinking of now is not so much, i've been thinking of stuff that you have done, and that if you spend a little bit of, not much time, maybe ten minutes on each topic, just having a little look at it and finding a problem, this is the sort of problem i was doing a month or two ago, can i do this one?"
can i remember how to get started in the main thing?
usually.
yeah.
"if you get started you can, you palm, the pattern comes back and you follow it through and you get the answer, erm, need to do it every, maybe about once a month or so, for each topic, don't let a topic go for about a month without you looking at it for ten minutes or so, and it will be surprising how that little bit of effort keeps it in your mind, so when you come to the exam you don't sit down there and go, oh, it's two months ago, i was doing everyone right, wonderful."
mm.
"now i just, can't think, can't remember."
mm.
"so it's to keep it in your mind, erm."
we you.
yeah.
"did quite a few graphs last time, and you're good on algebra, manipulating things, you're good on trig, vectors and matrices, how do you feel about those?"
"er,what's matrices ?"
"vector, oh dear."
"erm, you're doing paper three and you do paper three, you do matrices, might even do determinants, it's not that clear  about somewhere before, you know that."
"erm, so scale, proportion, those are the few, few things brought in together, we'll , we'll start off with just weight, now we'll find sort of weights of things, and then we'll make it more and more difficult."
mm.
of less easy.
mhm.
"less easy as it goes along, so we've got, start by saying loaf of, what do you want to buy at the moment?"
er.
sold by weight.
bar of chocolate.
bar of chocolate.
okay.
"bar of chocolate, and what sort of size do they come in, sort of hundred gram."
yeah.
things.
"well, right, erm so a three bars of chocolate, there's one in the hundred grams,will cost you twenty eight pence."
"so, one."
"a hundred grams, for one bar, costs you twenty eight pence, right, and then another one that's two hundred grams and it'll cost you fifty pence."
you know what this is going to be.
yeah.
"this is going to be easy he thinks, so you've made your mind up before you go to the shop, but unfortunately when you get there there's a, they've got these special hundred gram bars in because they, they haven't got a hundred, there's a big sticker on them saying ten more chocolate, extra bit free, extra ten free, on the smaller bars, so which ones do you buy?"
"how much does, that one extra ten ?"
"this, yeah, the one hundred gram ones have an extra ten added on now."
okay.
"think as an exercise, work out."
"how each of the prices of each one, and you work out which which way round you're going to do it, and then talk to me about it as you're doing it."
mm.
"first of all put, get that into grams, that's, that's a hundred and ten grams ."
right.
"so the first bar, one ten grams cost twenty eight p."
right.
"and the second one, the second bar's fifty p."
so i wanna get that.
"so just write the second one out again, the second one you get."
it's two hundred grams.
it's fifty p.
"so two hundred grams, fifty p, about erm a hundred and ten for twenty eight, which ones easier to work with?"
the  for fifty.
mm.
so now you find out how much for one gram.
right.
"so good rule is work out the easy one first, now they're going to be about the same , erm, otherwise they wouldn't be asking."
mm.
"you, it'd be obvious."
"erm, so if you, if you do the easy one, and let's say it comes out to ten pence per gram, and you do the difficult one and it comes to a hundred and three pence per gram, right, or point nought one pence per gram."
mm.
"what's, what would that indicate to you?"
"er, e, no point in whatever is cheaper."
would it?
"the first one, nought."
"i mean, look, okay, look at these two bars of chocolate that you've got, there , looking at it they're going to be about the same price, you're not going to find one ten times as dear as the other, are you?"
mm.
so if one came out at ten pence per.
"think your first one's probably got wrong,."
"oh, right,."
one of them's wrong.
"right, you, you think , this doesn't seem right to me, and this is developing your common sense approach to maths, which always goes the actual maths, you've done the maths, yeah, you have a little look and it won't, does that make sense?"
"no, whoops, i might have put one the other when it should have been the other way round, so always have this check, er does the answer look, i mean, no, you can't always tell, but sometimes you can, sometimes you can think well those two are about the same price per gram, aren't they?"
mm.
okay?
"so, work out those."
mm.
"and, say, explain the logic of it, why you're doing it the way you're doing it."
"well, if you, you want to find out how much per gram, will each bar so how much the twenty eight p, how much, yeah, how many grams, no, we know how many grams were there."
how many pennies per gram?
how many pennies per gram?
good.
"this is, this is the part where a lot of people get stuck."
"you can work it out, how many pennies per gram, or you can work it out, how many grams per penny, and it doesn't matter which way round you do it, you know what the answer means, but which way do you prefer?"
mm.
"er, how many pennies per."
"how many pennies per gram, i would prefer that too, so just choose one way and stick to it, i always do it that way, and then you're not confusing yourself doing it different ways."
so how many pence would you pay for a gram on that first bar?
a hundred and ten divided by twenty eight.
"alright, let's look at that, let me just have a little look down here."
okay.
"a hundred and ten divided by twenty eight, you've got this is pence per gram, a hundred and ten grams divided by twenty eight pence, the answer to this is grams per penny,."
mm.
"it was a hundred and ten, wasn't it?"
"hopefully,."
yeah.
"we've got a hundred grams divided by twenty eight pennies, the answer is whatever it comes to grams per divided by pennies, grams per penny, so that's a good check that you've got it the right way up, before you go and calculate it you just have a little look, what have i got here?"
i've got grams per penny.
"you got, and you can write it like that when you write it down, a hundred and ten grams divided by twenty eight p equals whatever the number is grams per penny."
"so that's a easy way to make sure that you, because that was the first thing you went for now, in the exam you might well put that down and think, oh, hang on, doesn't look right, perhaps it's the other way up."
mm.
"and then start losing confidence, wasting time, if you've got some check, like that, right, okay, so if you like to work that one out, you shouldn't have any problem with the, the second bar, if you can do the first one."
three point nine.
three point nine two.
three point nine grams per penny.
"that's a  leave the three point nine two, because they might be, they may be close, they may not."
okay?
the other one's a hundred divided by fifty.
mhm.
four.
"right, so there's not much, this looks these answers could both be correct because."
mm.
"they're about the same, so when the hundred gram bar has got the extra ten it's it's just just makes it the better bargain, er, they're not losing much on that cos they save on the wrapping, so it probably costs them the same."
mm.
they do it that way.
"now what happens if it gets more complicated, and all it, another way another way of checking this, erm, what would happen."
to buy.
"what would happen if you, let's have a look at g, depends on, what would happen if you were still paying fifty pence, but they gave you four hundred, four hundred grams of chocolate, well you get eight grams per penny, this is another test that you got it the right way up, if it were still only two hundred grams, but you payed more money for it, let's say they charged you a pound, i think you'd get less grams per penny."
"so good ways of checking that you got it right, and then you can go on comfortably with, let's have a look at erm this time you're buying a block of gold, er."
"as you do, yeah."
"which reminds me, yeah, the last block i got i'll have to take it back, it was the wrong colour, we've got some silver got some, got."
"yeah, i hate it when that happens, yeah."
some silver gold.
"ah, it's terrible, innit?"
did you have your receipt?
no.
oh.
"that's awful, that is ."
"i went to the, i went to the gold shop when they were shut actually,to get it in the first place."
mm.
that's why they wouldn't give me my me give me the money back.
"ah, , yeah."
"so here's one lump of gold, okay, and that's erm how big shall we make it?"
that big.
a metre?
going to need a truck to carry this home.
"yeah, you never have any negatives, you."
mm.
negative metre.
"negative metres, okay."
so it's a a cube one.
okay.
"metre in all directions,."
mm.
"and they're selling them off, gold, gold prices have dropped, you can get a metre, a cubic metre of gold for, say, a million pounds?"
yeah.
twenty p and i'll pay it off.
"for a million pounds, one million."
"now there's somebody else next door selling off,there is a surplus."
can go next door to us.
"is a surplus of goods, about a ton in good wool, there's a surplus of gold at the moment ,."
ah .
all selling them off like their paying you to take it away.
yeah.
"a million pounds, i'd call that paying him."
"now this bloke, this bloke unfortunately measures it in centimetres, he would, wouldn't he, it could have been worse, he could."
"yeah, oh yeah."
have measured it in inches or something.
mm.
"erm, and erm he sells smaller bits, but they are cheaper, obviously, and his are eighty centimetre cube of gold, okay?"
"and he says, sells his off at a quarter of a million, per cube."
mm.
"which one's cheaper, which one would you go for?"
how do you work it out?
"i'd go for, i'd go for him, cos i don't like this centimetre part."
okay.
"so for one metre cubed,."
you'd  this start a new page and do all your  of a page.
"one metre cubed, costs one million pounds, there it is, eighty centimetres,i'm starting one to get, change numbers, such like that to metres, or at centimetres."
"good so that's the first thing you've got to do, get these into the same sort of units this is a sort of variation where we had grams and kilograms and things."
"erm, thinking ahead, i'd probably turn that to metres."
okay.
three point eight.
right.
"it's one metre cubed, it's one point eight, erm, er, but, don't know actually, i'd rather have it in centimetres."
"hmm, so would i."
yeah.
any day.
"two , why why would you rather have it in centimetres?"
"erm, then i can, well because dividing point eight by, that'll make it a strange figure."
right.
so if you can avoid the decimals and avoid the fractions and.
this is a conversation with mr swinton  in galashiels.
mr  is seventy two.
right mr .
"well er i think some of my earliest memories are er dating to the first world war time when i was a boy and we lived in  street which er during the war, we made a shift to  which was really the opposite side of the street."
yeah.
"it was a peculiar street because  street was on a higher level and at one time, the dam which must have been open, now the dam when i mention the dam, it's the mill lead, but known to everybody in galashiels as the dam."
and it runs through the town and was the means of driving the waterwheels in the old days in the factories.
"and er this divided this street into two but at probably a number of years before, it had been tunnelled in and the top part of the street was called  street and there, there was a slight hill run down to ."
now my father had the garage in .
"it was er he had had it since my grandfather had had the same place as a blacksmith's shop and then my father followed on with the garage with cycles first of all, and then when the motor trade came in, he started in motors repairing."
motor repairing.
"had the garage been a, a erm a stable at one time?"
"was it, did, did he have stabling or for coaches?"
no.
"i think it, like in galashiels there seemed to be a lot of rows of one storey cottages at one time in that part."
"and at a later date, part of them had been, another storey had put them."
"er but at that time this, this, the blacksmith's shop was really made in a, a one storey cottage."
then the gardens were befind behind the front row and then there would be another row of cottages behind that again.
"now as the garage grew, the, the blacksmith's shop was, it still remained in the same place but the remainder of the cottages were made into the garage, and the garden ground was filled with sheds with corrugated iron roofs."
and it made a long garage.
a deep garage.
and then in these days there were pits for going underneath the cars er dug into the ground so as you could get underneath the cars.
there were no lifts lifting the cars up at that time.
what year did your fathers er it was really a bicycle shop that he had but.
yes.
erm did he er make it into a garage?
i should think round about nineteen hundred or nineteen hundred and one or two it was.
was that the first in gala?
er no.
there had been a shop in  street which is still there but it's been used for other things now.
but they were the first people to sell a motor car in galashiels.
they called them james .
and er they had sold a car in eighteen ninety eight i think it was.
the first motor car in galashiels.
and er that was before registration of cars.
"i can't find out what make of car it would be, but it would probably be a, a french or german car."
and it was sold to a wealthy manufacturer.
"well a, a mill owner, the owner of the skin works in galashiels, a mr ."
and this er was the first car in galashiels.
but we came into it about after nineteen hundred i should say.
"we bought an engine in edinburgh, a gas engine, run off the town's gas to drive the machinery we had."
"er we also did general engineering because my father was an engineer er and my grandfather was a blacksmith, my father was an engineer."
the machinery was driven by the gas engine first of all.
"in later years that, it was driven by an electric motor."
"but the shafting, it was driven off the shafting and we had lathes and drilling machines."
"and an ideal little workshop for anybody doing work as they did in the early days, most of the components of a motor car had to made."
"labour was cheap , time was no  object in these days ."
"and er when an article became, when you needed an article or something broke down in the car and you needed to m=make something up on the lathe it was made on the premises."
"later on the change in the trade, components were readily got as cars became more popular."
and er there were not so many in the older days every car was an individual thing.
"but in the later days when they made mass production was coming in, the components for them, it was easier to buy a component and fit it than to, to make up a, a piece in your own workshop."
"but er i i would think, although it's before my time, i would think that er of what i've heard my father talking about these early days, there was great enthusiasm for motorcycles and some of the early registered numbers you'll find that there's many of them were motorcycles, the young men of the town who had probably been cyclists, quite a number of them er took up this motorcycling and they made their own motorcycles so were buying either kits and er even manufacturing the tanks and these things themselves."
and our er workshop was open for and they got every assistance and every help from my father in these days.
mhm.
"they these when i remember the garage, it was a series of er lock up garages in the front, with a central one opening right through to the back."
and er by that time the the horse shoeing has gone out.
"my father had first er he had, him being an engineer, and had been working in glasgow after his er having served his apprenticeship at amos  the, it was the thing to go to glasgow in these days which was the centre of all engineering activity, and er to gain experience he went to glasgow."
"and er also many engineers when they were out their time, they went to glasgow and for a few years, he, everybody who went from galashiels, word got through to him and he met them at the station and got them settled in their digs in glasgow."
and er.
"would, this would be about the turn of the century ?"
"it would be about before, it would be eighteen ninety seven i should think."
when my grandfather died in er that year.
er eighteen ninety seven he died.
"and er he that, my father came back to run the business for my grandmother."
and er later on he took it into his own name you see.
"but er his erm  father was the blacksmith and he had been born away up , and er he came to he came to serve his time in a blacksmith's shop at  and er."
the one that's still there?
"still there today, aye."
"it's still there in, in  today."
"he came to serve his time in , he came from a place they called  green, which was a track between the hills away up ."
"and er it was probably where the drovers came through, it's a drove road and i, i haven't been quite able to find out what he i think he would be a shepherd probably."
and my yeah my great grandfather.
"this is your grandfather's father, your great grandfather."
mm.
and he died in eighteen forty eight when my grandfather would be about probably eight year or nine year old i think.
"er he, the family, must have came at a later date into galashiels."
"galashiels in, in, at that period was the place for everybody to come to."
because the mills were thriving and you would come to galashiels and get a job right away.
"but first of all he served his time in the smithy at  and he met his wife, my grandmother in  which was quite, you can quite imagine, it was just a walk up over the hills and er he met her in  and er they were married."
she had been born in edinburgh but only mad chance because i think that the family were only there a short time.
they belonged  and they had to come back to .
and they were shoemakers.
and er their name was .
er there's none of them left now except an old mrs  in  who is over a hundred.
and she's the last of the  family.
"in the borders, there's some in, in england but er that, that family has died out in the borders."
"er mostly anyway there is a, a  relative i believe er in the town but er my  grandfather after he had served his time at  smithy, got a, a job in galashiels in one of the big factories, which was er  was the name of the manufacturers there."
"it was one of the big mills and er there's still parts of it yet, in use, one of the high buildings is still there."
"and er he was there for quite a number of years and then went to  just for a few years, and came back to galashiels to work with the same firm and then he started business on his own."
"he, i say, in these days, blacksmiths made bicycles."
"and we have a bicycle which he made in the year eighteen seventy, that was before he had started business on his own and he had erm made it for a young solicitor in galashiels and i believe it was used in a race from galashiels from  place in galashiels to the ."
where five of these boneshakers or velocipedes took part.
"and er this bicycle well it would go fashion and was put in a, a loft in one of the, it must have changed hands from mr  whom it was made for."
er it er was found in a loft in  mill about the year nineteen hundred.
"and they were going to throw it on the scrap heap but somebody in the mill the said, that was the bicycle that adam  had made."
and we got it back into the family and it's been with us ever since.
"during all our alterations i've seen it in the old garage away up in a loft and i've seen it put out in the back yard in the rain, and i've always saved it and it's there today."
"and er after er my grandfather made that bike, after he started business on his own, he had, well the next thing came in was the penny farthing bicycle."
mhm.
and blacksmiths still worked on the penny farthing bicycle.
"and i have lots of letters which i discovered about five years ago, which i thought were probably letters that my father had written it, adam , because his name and my grandfather's name were exactly the same."
"but when i looked at the date, my father could only have been about twelve year old you see, when these letters were written so it must have been my grandfather writing to coventry and birmingham for parts for the penny farthing bicycles which he worked on."
"and er these were er he would do a lot of the iron work, because a lot of the iron work would be forged."
"but wheels and these sort of things would be got from coventry in , i think, the maker's the, the same people who invented the, the safety bike."
they were er these letters are to one of these firms.
and erm these er he must have given up bicycles when the penny farthing was outdated.
"and er there's quite a number of years he, there was many bicycle shops in galashiels when the new safety bike came in, and blacksmiths probably didn't bother doing any work on them."
it was mainly newer bicycle shops.
"but when my father took over, when he came back to galashiels, he started in bicycles and there was quite probably  ten bicycle shops in galashiels at that time and er he gave, well he, he attracted business with his efficient way of repairing bicycles and er it's funny that after about a number of years, we were between the last, after the last war i should say, the second world war, er we were about the only people for, for a period the only bicycle shop in galashiels."
there's more now but at that period we were the only one left .
"then we, father er with doing the bicycles and with interest in other engineering things like gas engines, which seemed to have a, a period of er great prosperity i would say er in the period between nineteen hundred or maybe a few years before that until early twenties the, the gas engines were ideal things for little factories."
and er you even find them in some of the mills er in galashiels and in  er as the taking place of steam.
"and the, or driving part of the mill i wouldn't say they completely took over from steam."
but they just went fashion .
and er when electric motors came in naturally and each individual machine was driven by an electric motor.
"er well this maybe gave him an insight into working on gas engines, er i couldn't really say."
"but he erm he was once burned very severely with one of them blowing out, and he's he suffered from it all his life after that."
but er er when you looked at his skin he was all burned in the front and er with this explosion of a gas engine.
mhm.
"now in the period that i come into it would be the first world war, when we had er, in these days, the thing we always, to look at the motor trade then, it was a from the carriage trade."
because motor cars didn't go at great speeds and nobody would dream of taking a motor car to edinburgh when the railway was there and could get you in edinburgh within three quarters of an hour.
"but the, the motor car was used firstly for taking people back and forward to the station."
the old horse and cab.
and then people had picnics on the sundays of the summer it grew more quite a lot from the hiring.
and then after when there was practically no erm commercial trade with them at that time.
any commercial vans or lorries seemed to be made what was originally private cars.
"and which is natural because you know, the very early motor cars were only a sort of toy for the rich and er when it came to you see er grocer's vans or, or er laundry vans made old private cars."
"and then when the first world, world war came along,a lot of cars were remade into ambulances and er then the lorries began to be, come into their own."
there were there wouldn't be very many before the wirst first world war.
"but after the first world war, there seemed to be quite a lot of lorries."
"and after the war broke up, there were quite a lot of x w d lorries, lorries on the market and they were converted into a erm charabancs which was an open bus  ."
"and er they, we had a, a stake in that too at the very beginning er we did have a converted er x w d lorries into charabancs and we also got some newer ones."
but this ceased in nineteen twenty six.
when we sold to another firm.
"er who ran bus services from gala to selkirk and melrose and er we sold out to them because we, the other side of the business where the private car side seemed to be growing."
and we just hadn't the time to do both.
"and er it was quite a good move i think, to dispose of the, the charabancs and concentrate on the private cars."
"we then got the, the agency for morris, which was a very popular car and erm we also got the agency for austins, which er, it came about with father being interested in a hiring car, the austin twenty, he thought it was, it was the best that could be got."
"and he went into the main agent in edinburgh and gave them an order for three of those, and , we didn't get them just right away because er probably we'd have got the last one about a couple of years later  in these days ."
"but anyway we, they must have been so impressed by the, the order that they got, that they gave us the agency for galashiels and selkirk for the austin."
"and , the next year, the austin seven came on the market and proved to be one of the most popular cars in the market."
the foundation of your future prosperity in a sense.
"that was we were main one of the, my father seen er possibilities er when he attended the london show, he went er he, he was very much taken on with the morris cowley first of all."
"and he went to, he decided to go straight to oxford before he came back to galashiels and er see william morris who was lord nuffield later on."
"but he, we, we were offered the agency for the four counties in the borders."
"but as we were very small people in these days, he could only see his way to take selkirkshire and peebleshire."
he'd probably have been better to have taken selkirkshire and roxburghshire.
but however that's the way things went and er we were distributors for the morris for selkirkshire and peebleshire.
and held it right recently.
"which the, the organization changed you see and er it wasn't through our fault but er they wanted some, a main agent in every town after that."
and the distributorship fell through.
"but that was only after we had it for about thirty years or, or more."
"to go back to your own life mr , erm you  could you er were you always interested in engineering as a boy?"
no.
"i would say of the three brothers, i was the one that was least interested in engineering."
"i always had a sort of inclination towards buildings, architecture and that sort of thing."
"but being the son of my father, it was his aim to send me out to serve my time as an engineer."
which i really i went to amos  and i didn't like it but i had to stick it.
"but i, i only er times were very poor as it was nineteen twenty seven, twenty eight and things were very poor in the mills especially."
"and a lot of the engineering was on textile machinery and er i didn't, i just wouldn't go back to it after i'd been at it about a couple of years."
i wouldn't finish my and i came into our own firm and started with bicycles and motorcars.
"right up until i wasn't able to do any more and able to, like all engineers you get most of the men  when you get to the stage where you're not able to crawl under cars  and do things like that so you  you find another business, we went into sales and, and er accessories, stores and that i've been in all that line in the last twenty years before i retired."
did all your schooling take place in gala?
"yes, my schooling i went to the  school in nineteen seventeen in the middle of the first world war."
and er we had er a very fine teacher then when  er i can look back in pleasure when i went to school.
"they were miss  was the teacher and the, the next three classes i would say with great pleasure, and then we came to one of the old ones which er they were more severe, probably she used the tawse a lot."
"and we used to as we had nicknames for the ones we didn't like, she was called ."
"so er we didn't like er  so we, she was a miss  ."
"and we had erm we, there was a few changes during that time, we used to get troops coming in and occupying the classroom, and we  maybe, at the very early days i can remember having to go to the  street school and also the  street hall which that was a church hall."
"but we only went for half a day at that period and then for a month or so then the troops went away again, we got back into our own school."
"i can remember the, the days of the, the armistice when we thought there was a lot of the  with the teachers and er, this is faintly in my mind, we heard all the mill whistles blowing."
and er then we knew that the war was finished.
"and then every year after that, they used to hold the one minute's silence which the mill whistles went and you stood for a minute and then they went again and that was it over."
"and this carried on, right on well practically until the second war."
"and er then we had a bit, there was a victory organization of the schools then."
"we had to go from the  school to the  school for two years and back to the  school again, and er finally we'd go to the academy."
"but i went to a private school after that, i went to one run by a mr , mr e m ."
he was a grand master er and er you got greek and latin and all these sort of things.
"but i didn't er i think his teaching days, he was getting rather old and he didn't control us as he should have been able to."
and er it was a mixed school some of ours er different ages you see because it was just one big classroom.
"and er however it's funny that you, things remain with you, er even in the greek and latin, i often find when i'm doing a crossword puzzle, something i don't think i would ever take in, and yet i seem to, can answer the  question."
about er er the son of er greek goddesses or something .
"the, after the school i was never one for er i never was a great one for sport."
"although i did go and watch the rugby, i never was a great one for, and i, i used to swim quite a lot."
mhm.
"but er most of my interests were in motoring actually er in the days of er after we left the school after i was driving, i was er, these were the days when if you had a motorcar, the whole world was at your feet, and er you could go all over britain if you, just for petrol at one and thruppence ha'penny a gallon or something like that."
"and er therefore er we made the most of it, my chum and i, sid , we were in nineteen thirty two i would think we would be one of the first hundred people or so to go with a, a week's er tour to paris by air."
a package deal.
"the, the imperial airways had just er they had just received four big planes er which they put on the paris er route."
"and i think we were going, first of all it was a firm polytechnic tours in london."
"we had booked up for the ordinary ship and, and rail you know, to go over by ship and rail but er during the months awaiting the, i think we were going in july and er we had booked up maybe about april, but they had put these planes on and polytechnic wrote to us and said, if we paid two pounds ten extra, we could go by air and we did it and the full tour for a week in paris, going by air, was twelve pounds ten."
and that included two tours .
"and we flew from er that was from london, we flew from the croydon airport in london, and er we, you went down to er an, a small office near victoria station in these days and er you we, you put your luggage in there and then they took you out on a special bus to croydon."
"and we only flew about i think it was four thousand feet, that we flew and we thought this was terribly high."
"and then and as far as i remember we, you could hear the noises of the engines , terrible, not, not like planes today."
"and you could also feel the, the shuddering of the, the wings and the fuselage er and er it was rather frightful you know, if you hadn't been before."
"but er it's so simple today when you realize the, the difference, how easy it is and but er that was an experience i can tell you."
can you possibly remember how much you were paid for your apprenticeship with amos ?
"yes, i have the slip somewhere, and my father i didn't keep it but my father must have kept it, but i discovered it one day and it was seven and thruppence i think for the first week's pay."
and that was the common thing in these days.
with er apprentices was seven and thruppence or seven and six or something like that.
and that would be about the the nineteen twenties.
nineteen twenty seven i would think.
mhm.
nineteen twenty seven..
and er your working week was what?
well erm eight o'clock in the morning till quarter to six i think it was then in the evening.
"er there must have been at one time it, it had been six o'clock i think it was a quarter to six we finished."
"and there was a thing we a lot of the work in the mills was in  or selkirk and you went to the early train in the morning, there was a train from galashiels to  and it was full of workers going to the mills in  and if you going er to work in a mill there, your, your foreman would come, you would draw the tools, at the, the night before you went to the job, you would take them there to the train in the morning, and meet the foreman and you would go to  to do the job and the same to selkirk."
and these sort of jobs would be repair work or construction work?
er textile machinery er i can't remember us doing very much except er dismantling machinery.
mm.
"er because at that time there was quite a lot, you would get one mill in  probably with somewhere about seventy looms in it and there would only be ten of them working."
"the, it was into the depression period."
"it had been i think a lot of the mills had been during the very, the years after the war, they had been very busy and a lot of them would build sheds and take up looms that were, you, they probably had new looms on order but they were filled with a lot of scrap almost you know, anything they could get that work, work."
"and er they were, well quite a lot of them were scrapped in the days when the depression came on."
"and erm the  i, i can't remember er   oh i think most of the work up there that i was on, we were doing different jobs in the mill, like er when very too when the mills were closed at the holidays, we, we used to go up and work in some of the mills."
and er we had er i've seen us work er i think one of the jobs was on shafting and things like that mostly.
didn't work on the machinery so much.
"er but as i say, i wasn't very long at that so er when i came back to the, the motor trade, and bicycle trade, motor trade, cars in these days you get a variety of er all sorts of cars."
"some of them were  some had got old cars in where the tyres, if it was a puncture it was these great big wheels with beaded edge tyres which you can, you put on in quite a different way from the modern car tyres."
you had to put them all on in a piece you see with the tube in it and er things became much easier when the wheel base trim came in.
"er then er petrol, before that i was in the, before i started the work we used to go out delivering petrol and petrol was all done in tins, two gallon tins."
there was no petrol pumps.
"and er they were kept in a special store which had to be three feet into the ground you know, for safety."
"and every big mansion house had a place about ten feet the house, where they had a store for holding the tins."
"and each of the places er where we got the supply of tins, er we had a  little van that went out to deliver the tins and we delighted as boys, going out, carrying the two tins er into the place."
"and er the cars then were all painted in, there were no cellulose paint, we had a paint shop there but er it, and we had an old painter who used to paint the cars in enamel and they were an awful lot of work on them."
and you had to have great dustsheets to keep the dust.
"because if it had been painted, and the paint took quite a long time to dry and er if there was a speck of dust it remained there forever."
or  or you would have to take the whole thing off again.
"so there were, the place was specially  big dustsheets and kept the dust off the paint."
and there was a lot of rubbing down and that sort of thing.
"after the cellulose paint came in , things were quite different."
"they had to be done in a special, you know where they extracted the, the fumes the, the paint shop."
and it was a very much harder paint.
did you go to a technical college ?
"in the evenings, everybody then went to the technical college here."
"it, it two nights a week."
and er that was the old college in  street.
"i can remember it well, it was lit by gas even in these days you know  it would have been all electric light but it was gas and er we had erm, i would go for engineering drawing and maths probably i think."
i just can't remember.
", for about two years you know after  and everybody went to something or other."
it was the done thing.
"there was no er you, you thought nothing about it."
"and what about er your life, you started really on the sort of bicycle and repair side of life."
yes.
erm how did that what did your father pay you in those days for that?
"oh well, being the boss's son i probably got ten shillings a week probably."
ten.
when i started i would think .
"and er later on er i would be er wages i think were then about three pound something, in the, very little three pounds."
for a skilled man?
yes.
for a skilled man.
"er they had been very much lower er er in nineteen hundred and ten when we, i have some of the books showing you know, as little as er thirteen shillings a week for a skilled man you see and that sort of thing."
"but erm and my father was also an inventor, he had, he had done, everything was used."
"we he had a patent on what we called aiming race for laying guns in, during the first world war."
"he, it was for the, you know, the, the instructor would come round and see if you had aimed the thing, it was a tripod sort of thing."
"now orders came from  and sons the printers who were great target printers, and are still today the great target printer."
"now orders came from the, and also we had orders for th, e the falling target in the  you know, of a, a rifle range where you had to er put up the frames you know with a target on it and er we made a lot of these during the first world war."
that bit we gave up after the first world war but we made er we did make some of these er patented things that they had in the second world war.
"er he also, everything was used, they were made gas piping and what  got the piping in certain lengths and there's always , a small bit about a foot left over, he made these into gas pokers."
"and er the things that we had, we had a  or two when they used to be, when all the cars most of them were open in the early days and the, the limousines who were chauffeur driven."
"but er there were so many open cars and we had an upholsterer who er made the hoods and repaired the hoods and upholstery and er we even made things the old scraps of these er just to, we made bags for, for carrying trade plates for er people going away for cars."
"to oxford and, and birmingham."
"and er i used to go myself quite er when there were well when there were one coming up i've seen me go into, down in the pullman train from here to er, well we had about five changes i think,father had it all marked out so as you changed at a certain place."
we used to walk from new station at new street station at birmingham snow hill station.
"now that's all away now there's, there's no snow hill i don't think you can really find out where it was nowadays."
"but we got into a train there and went to, to crewe i think it was."
and then there was a certain place where we would go to a breakfast on the train.
"then he landed in oxford just at the right time to go out to the factory and it was open, and you had to get your car you could and see that everything was ."
"and erm if you noticed anything, get it done before you left the works you see."
"and then he, he got on the road and he, we usually took, he had to run it er not twenty five miles and hour, and er you had to run it, we, we stopped at preston if we could get there."
that was one of the stopping places.
and then the next day we brought it home.
"but er that was one of the things er he it was an enjoyable trip and the roads were in these days, er you get the motorways today, i just think on the roads, what they were in these days, there was even some places we went through a ford in the middle of the road, with the water about two or three inches deep."
"and er there was very little money spent on the roads at that time, the, the railways had been the great carriers of everything and the motorcars were just coming in ."
"and er but, but i did see the roads improving continuously through all these years."
did your brothers go with you into the family business?
"yes, my oldest brother, they were older than me er my brothers, there was one two years older, there was one seven years older than me."
"and er i was really the youngest, there was one who had died."
er but he had died actually as a very young child.
"then when the wartime came along, the last war, i didn't, i didn't used to rush away, i, i had that sense to not just, to rush the  with the  rest of them, so  i joined the fire brigade, the regular fire brigade."
"and er i was unmarried at that time and erm i, for a number of, well till nineteen forty was the end of nineteen forty i think, i joined up and went into the, the r a o c as it was then, it became the  the side that i was in ."
"in a workshop which was being made up    then we went er, it was funny that we passed through london, the very day or second day that word arrived that the invasion was on, the troops had arrived in, in normandy."
and oh the reception we got in london.
"they thought that we were going straight, we and we thought so too  that we would just go straight over the, through london ."
and everybody after years of gloom were all absolutely er treating everybody you know.
"we just couldn't get off  we had the metropolitan police escorting us through you see, to the, we were going to the south."
er where i ended up in  barracks which was a guards barrage barracks near .
in surrey.
"and then we started we thought, oh well we'll just be guarding then we'll be away."
"however we, the next thing we knew was the flying bombs began to come over."
"and this, there, we couldn't understand it what these things were that went flying through the sky and er aeroplane tried to chase them."
they couldn't because they weren't speedy enough.
"and then the next thing you heard er away in the distance some had landed about croydon or streatham or something and, and some landed in the hills rounds about us."
one landed in the very centre of er east grinstead too.
but er however there were none of them struck the camp.
"so we were off er after that we were off and landed down in erm bishop's wharf  er in the woods there and we, the next morning we were off down to gosport and we were embarked on the ships there and er landed in normandy at the  beach it was."
and er then we were led through into the  assembly area.
and it was quite quiet for a little bit because most of them had established themselves and we were waiting for a breakout and er we didn't get on the move again until they went through the  after it had been.
"er we went through just after it, the rest of the troops had gone through, we followed them on."
and then we were held up at a place because some of our tanks the seventy ninth armoured division was er holding all the special tanks er which were flamethrowers and flails and all these sort of things.
er and they had to use these crocodiles er  down the coast er where the germans were holding out er at  and dunkirk you see.
"er and although they'd got, they couldn't get the towns although they had ."
and also they sent some of them away down to the the the army that was coming from the south.
"er i can't remember i wasn't with them but we, we were in a spot and erm some of the tanks were away down there and some were up here and we, the next move we went to ."
and.
and all this time you were recovering and repairing?
yes.
"recovering and repairing, aye."
"well mainly recovering, taking them into workshops."
"many of them were er  sometimes we, you got into a minefield and you couldn't, you gave it up you know because er  by that time i think there would be plenty replacements coming on the market."
"but some of the early days, they, we, we gathered them into a park which er the they were cannibalized."
"sending back to britain for a, a part, they took it off an old tank you see, and on that had been part  was still you see, but the tank was er useless but there would maybe be a bit of the track alright, so we cannibalized them."
and they were put onto it.
"and then we went right through belgium and holland, we were stuck in holland for er in  luckily enough for the winter."
in er the last year before we broke through.
"and then it was erm erm   which was er battered about a bit but we were preparing for the, the next move you see."
"then after they crossed the rhine, we moved away the north holland about ."
which was on the german border.
"but by that time er we weren't there very long and the war finished and i was there in for a year after that in, in er germany."
up near the .
"so that was er and then i came back here i was demobbed and came back to, i was er the highest rank i had was corporal you know, in the  acting corporal actually."
er in er when we were in germany.
"now er we, i came back here then and we had, the, the workshop had to be brought back to normal again to deal with the cars."
"er and the, we had, had a lot of, during the war, we did a lot of general engineering, we had made er what they called iron shearing machines."
cutting the iron by hand.
and er it actually went back to my grandfather's day when he always wanted to get one of these machines and er he couldn't afford it.
"but he got a pattern made and had the base of the machine made at a local foundry and he made all the leverage parts and got the, he got the blades made in sheffield or somewhere and er he made one for himself."
and he called it the  well he was asked to make one for other blacksmiths.
"and we we had kept on making this, maybe we, some years we would sell about ten of them."
this had went on and on and there was practically every blacksmith's shop in scotland would have one of these machines made by us.
and they called it the  number one.
and er i think there were some of them still in use about fifty years after they were made.
they'll be still in probably in use today.
"but at the beginning of the war, when things were very doubtful, and we didn't know whether the army would commandeer all our buildings or what, and we started to make bench models of this er iron shearing machine."
and.
can you describe really what what an iron shearing machine does?
"well it's like a big lever and it has a, at the bottom it has a bar which the very high tensile steel is fixed into."
"and, and the and the bar on the bottom holding the no the base of the thing holds the other bit of the blade."
mm.
"and as you pull it down, it's the leverage that cuts the, the steel."
it er it'll cut mild.
it's a huge knife really.
it's like a huge knife aha.
yeah.
"just the same, you've seen them with paper cutters you know."
it's the same principle.
like a guillotine type of thing.
"but er we made them er, the it's the leverage that does the cutting you see."
because you get er great leverage on this thing and it er you're cutting mild steel bars you see.
"and er we, we did erm we, we started making er bench models  because we found quite a lot of these had been made in germany."
"there, a lot had, we had never made the small ones before."
"but we started making them and er we made thousands during the war and part of the, the lower part of the garage was used for making these."
"and er then we after the war was finished, we continued making them for several years, but we had to transfer it to another factory."
"and it was a chancy business, sometimes we were very busy, sometimes we, we could er  we could diversify and making some other machines like we, we did some er rotary punching machines which were drilling a hole, you could punch it you see."
and er we did this er in this little factory at netherdale.
"but there was periods that your men you, you hadn't enough to occupy fully occupy the men."
and we got a firm in glasgow who had to move.
"they made bakery machinery, and they came er and took our factory over."
"and we, we concentrated on the motor trade after that."
"we, we kept on er making or doing repairs for the ministry of works for about ooh seven or eight years after the war finished, which kept a lot of men working in galashiels when we, you know, when they weren't very sure if they could come back to  their old jobs ."
but we kept this on for quite a number of years.
"and we had an inspector from the, the office from the home department here who er had his office down there, and we did all this, they were for er the ministry of works."
"and they, they did erm vehicles for the navy, the army, the air force and the forestry commission, any government thing that was ."
and er until it became the time when the thing got smaller and smaller and we finally had to do away with that place.
but it lasted for a good seven or eight years after the war was finished.
and provided work for quite a lot of men.
how.
"and then the other garage in the middle of the town, we got back to normal, repairs and er."
and how had had life changed between er the nineteen thirties and the nineteen forties?
by the time you got back.
oh very much.
very much er so although wages at the end of the war weren't so big you know even then er.
can you remember what sort of.
"five pound would be a, a, a wage you know, five, ten, five somewhere between five pound and er six pound i would think."
maybe three and.
"and, and they gradually went up."
three pounds before the war?
yes probably three pounds before the .
"now i was one who saved a lot myself, and we had some very good holidays."
"and one of the last holidays i took, and i was on my own, i went to the united states for, and canada for er the, the six weeks i think it was or eight weeks."
"and er that was a very interesting period because it was nineteen thirty nine and the, what the, my impressions of america were quite different when you got there, from er what er their er impressions of the world situation were."
"where even going on the boat, we went from glasgow from  quay in one of the  line boats and erm it cost erm the cheapest fares were twenty seven pounds ten return."
"the, the fare for er that i went was thirty two pounds ten."
"and that was er i didn't come back with an  line boat, i came back with a erm canadian pacific boat."
"because i changed out there, but we had to pay about five pounds just to change from one line to the other."
"but er we went from erm  quay, we did stay at belfast for about erm just er a few hours, picked up the belfast passengers, they, they, we didn't dock there,they came on by tender."
then you had about ten days at sea and you had oh three big meals a day included all in this.
"and erm dances and everything you know,it was really a, a luxury the crossing."
"although it was very rough , but i got used with it the seasickness caught me up going round the top of the highland, but once he was that and er i wasn't a drinker in these days but some old man says to me, er before you go to a meal, he says, take a drop of brandy."
"i, i says, oh, i says, i hate brandy, i says, i never could."
"and i did  and you know, i was never seasick after that."
"and i went er in the boat coming back er from canada was far worse as the one going but we went to boston and we stayed out in the harbour there and then we sailed down the coast into new york, which was a great sight."
"and the, the main object of going there was to see the world fair that was on that year."
"and er it was interesting to the point of view of their attitude to britain then and er you know they were isolationists , you see."
and er er their newspapers told an awful lot that ours  didn't tell you see .
"and their impression er of germany well you can imagine a big country like america, there's quite a lot of them germans and the, the german angle was er played up you see."
"and er they knew that there was gonna be a war whereas we put it our mind, we thought, well we'll be prepared but it'll never come."
"you know, and that's our sot of attitude."
but they knew it'll happen.
mhm.
"if it doesn't happen this year it'll happen next spring you see, and er one lady who had been with her aunty er over in the germany, she says when they went into, she knew they were accumulating theirs, she had some friends in germany and they, she said they were hoarding up just at the borders of poland i think it would be then."
"and er she, we had some very interesting insights you know into the, just from various people, what the situation was."
"and then er when i got to new york we were quite friendly with all the people on the boat you know that  made great friends with some of them and er i had two or three places to go, i had spent a few days at the world fair and then i flew down to washington and er then i came  back again."
er then i went buffalo and niagara falls and crossed over to canada which i had a few friends there.
and erm stayed in ottawa and toronto.
and er montreal.
"and then sailed from montreal, i was going to go back  my, it was my intention to go back to new york, but i changed my mind at montreal and sailed down the st lawrence from montreal, back to glasgow."
"well we'd, the, the trip back we didn't go into  quay, we stayed off the tail at the back and we came ashore."
and it was a magnificent sail up the clyde.
"everybody was impressed, it was a glorious day like this you know  so the clyde looks so beautiful when you see it in the, in, in a, in weather like this you know."
"and er  two or three friends, oh i, i had been on a number of cruises before that, to germany, to norway and sweden, to denmark."
i had been on all the northern capitals.
"and i had been once in a, a cruise liner to the canary islands and madeira in nineteen thirty five."
"and er some of these ships, this one was the empress of australia."
they had been old german hulks you know brought over to this country after the first world war as part of the reparations and they had been finished off in liverpool and glasgow somewhere.
"and er they were, a lot of them were sunk in the second world war."
"one of the finest ones i was ever on, which we enjoyed, it wasn't a new ship by any means, but it was the lancastrian."
mm.
and it was sunk at dunkirk.
mhm.
mhm.
and er  these are things you never forget you know.
"i was once going to go on a trip, my mate and i we  go a trip to er a train cruise down from er down through italy and."
mm.
here the ethiopian experiment was.
oh.
"the thing  you know with the, the italians."
that was cancelled.
and he cancelled his er trip but i'd i booked up for one to go to norway.
mhm.
and at that time so.
"so bringing you back to after the war, er how did the business continue er then or for, from that time forward?"
"well we had er the business was quite good er we had er we could do, at the end of the war, we could have done with an awful lot more cars, but we couldn't get them."
"i was just remarking the other day, i think i brought one of the first land rovers to the borders from edinburgh."
"and i can always remember it was in the middle of winter and  put on the, the four that bit  circular bit  put it into the four wheel drive and it came up there wonderful and the, yet er going in we were and the other car was swaying all over the place."
"but in, in the impression was that we'd a land rover then it's funny."
"er we could have done with cars, he says, what are they bringing out this silly thing when we could have done with more cars you know."
and who will we ever sell it to?
and mr  our salesman er he took it that big estate  and er mr  had got too old to go the shooting on the horse you know.
and er wondered if this land rover would go up there with the four wheel drive.
"so mr  went up and er he went a way up the hill, places that never a car or anything like that had been before because there were gullies and everything and he could have sank in the middle of a gully or something."
"however he, he must of chosen the right place to go and er he went right up onto the hill and mr  got his shooting er and he bought the thing on the spot."
i don't know if it's the i don't think it's the same one they have today but it was the first land rover that i can ever remember coming to the borders.
and then we took on  every farmer got one after that.
"but it did at the time appear rather a, the last thing."
the last thing that anybody would want.
"was anybody thinking on you know,to have er cars you know."
however it was a winner.
"and er we went on er for a few at, at that time we had agencies for jaguar, rover, m g, er riley, wolsley, erm humber."
"we had all these er and austin and morris, we had all these agencies at the end of the war, and yet we couldn't get enough cars."
"but er however things went on and er we, we've had very bad years some years when the we, stuck too much i think to some of the morris er they had their troubles and, and then eventually we, it was funny we were the only two people in the whole of britain who held the agencies for austin and morris together and we were at times we were thinking we must lose one of them."
"and er we never lost them, they joined together eventually and  we   that's all the position."
"and er we, we didn't do an awful lot on commercial later on, we gave up that er thing we, we mostly  concentrated on the private cars."
going back to your trip in america.
"but going, yes."
mhm.
now one of the things that was on the you know there was the great radio city music hall.
and er oh glamorous shows they had on there.
"and they had a what they called the  twenty four girls dancing you know, and also they, they had the, a film in the show which probably i think it was a bing crosby film that was on."
very good show.
"but another one, they had in another cinema across off it was just off broadway, the roxy i think it was, and they had goodbye mr chips."
that was with robert donat.
"and you know i went into that film it was just being launched in america, and there was a sort of prologue to the film and er i didn't know whether to, to become terribly angry or, or cry because the prologue was britain was a sinking ship you know, this was the last we would see of this great thing and they made the most of it you know, like er the the film was the old private schools you know the old well the public schools in england."
and er this was a thing that would die out you know.
they always had in america that sort of er something er that against colonialism you see.
"although there were more colonialism  in, in america than  than we were in  well are now anyway but er in, in a way that was the sort of impression."
"and that gave me a terrible feeling, i just didn't know what to, whether to you know, you was sad and yet you felt wild at them putting it that way."
"and yet they were right , they were right enough it, it never came again completely as it,nothing stay the same."
"but er some of the exhibitions at the great er world fair were really, there were some splendid things, although the main er theme of the thing wasn't so well it was grandiose in a way but just too much so."
it was the commercialism that struck me.
"the railways of america, the different er railways, they had a huge pavilion well a huge er arena open air, with a huge stage and it was the presentation of the history of the railway engine."
oops.
sorry about that.
rocket .
"something similar and er they came the, the great pacific engines that came on and they, two of them came down the stage, two of them were just higher up, and on the stage itself, there were scenes done like the hall in the grand central station, new york and er they were, it was either the ink spots or some of these dancers that gave a performance, and it was so well put on that you couldn't help being impressed by."
mm.
them you know.
and then they had that great aquatade aquacade in another place.
"it was er you  paid to get into it, but this railway show was all free."
"and there was er  with engines from all the different countries including the, the flying scotsman and, and different german trains and, and italian trains ."
"and then they, the one where johnny weismuller was, it was a lake a great arena which they did a lot of you know, swimming about in the lake and the different formations."
"and they, then the other ones er there was one with general motors and it was a, a huge thing, you were ten, it was a huge building, modern building but you just couldn't tell what it was from the outside."
but you went a nameless belt of chairs and it took you it was highways and horizons they called it.
"and you went these chairs and you went through a, a scenic part which showed you the roads of the future."
"now they're what we have today, the motorways you know."
mm.
"but it, it was so varied that you went through the, the cities and the highland scenes where they went through the highlands and in the country and then you ended up with coming a crossroads in a modern, a futuristic city, where if you look down you, the pavements were elevated and you walked down to where all the models of general motors were displayed they were crossing roads."
"and er i thought it was, what a money it must have cost to put that one commercial firm doing that."
mm.
"and ford was the same, you could have a run round in a, up and down you know in a sort of, in any of the latest models and oh there were some great commercial er pavilions in the, in the place really."
the british one wasn't too bad either in the new york world fair.
could you tell me now mr  some of your experiences as a town councillor please?
"well i, i was sitting in my house one night on the, i think it would be er nineteen fifty four, and a deputation came up from the ward committee to see me and wondered if i would join the council."
"i hadn't thought about it before then, and i said well i would need a day or two to think about it."
so they said they would come back the next week and see what i thought.
so i decided to go the council.
"at the time er i did various things, i was in the."
"could you, sorry to interrupt you, could you could you tell me what year this was mr ?"
nineteen fifty four it would be i think.
right.
and er.
you were in the opera company.
"i, i had been er just in the chorus of the opera company and er you know,various  the church choir and things like that i was in."
but er i gave up that and went er when i went the council.
"i, er first of all i was a kind of shy wee laddie  on the council."
because at that time the council was er men very much older than me and er very few young people on it really.
"how did you come, how was the election managed then?"
"well they were, the ward committee had been seeking for a, a candidate, but i had no opposition at that time ."
i was the only one who stood.
in that second ward.
which was a ward which i would say it was built about the the eighteen seventies.
"and er a lot of the people, the families had grown up and the housing was in a poor state."
but the old people preferred to remain there moving to properties which might be far away for them.
"now er when i went on the council,i was first put on the parks and recreation committee."
"the one that i would really like to have got onto was the, the building the housing committee."
which er i did eventually get and was a convenor for quite a number of years.
"and then i got the, i was convenor of the housing allocation committee for very many years."
i served under five different provosts.
whom er the last one that i can the last  who was alive died a fortnight ago.
it was colin .
"the first one i was on was, was under john ."
i was under er lindsey  provost lindsey .
"provost archie , provost colin  and provost , william ."
er now william  was on one term at the end.
"and i think i, i would just needed to say the word and i could have been provost myself but i didn't really feel that i would be able to control the council, i think that was my impression at this."
although i believe i would.
"but er later on when the council er after the new set up came on, i didn't join the new set up, like the region and the, the district councils."
"i, i didn't i came off the council at that time and er i became the president of the  gathering."
it was a three year appointment.
i was the first president of the  gathering.
now the duties i had to do there was to take the place of what the provost of the town did before you see.
"and er introduce the candidates to the public you know, over the balcony when they're elected."
and take part in all the ceremonies.
but there isn't now a a provost in gala?
no it's a district provost now.
provost  is for the district.
"you see now if anything happened er it could be a provost who'd  the district who hasn't anything to do with the galashiels you see, the next one in every probability."
"now er we had, i had followed the gathering  well since it was instituted in nineteen thirty."
"and had known, took, took part in every one, right up i'd never been away the town in the time the  was on."
all through these years  took part in every one for the last fifty years.
"and er in some way or other you know, not always in the same position but i'd always er had something to do with it."
going back to your.
"erm er council experience, erm what er you said that you were first put on the parks and recreation department."
erm what sort of duties did you have to deal with in that?
"well we had the parks to look after, we had the baths, the public baths and the playing fields to er they were administered through a parks superintendent."
"the, we did er our baths were dating from the nineteen fourteen period and they were getting rather old the, the, the boiler wasn't too good and we were afraid that it might burst at some time."
"we did erm get estimates for, to change the system."
"when the baths were made there were ladies days and gents days, mixed bathing was considered not the thing in these days, but it did come in in the twenty or the, or the late twenties."
"and the, with the boxes being all round the side, the dressing boxes, this was outmoded, we needed a building at the side, which there was sufficient room to build something at the side because we had a park at the side of it then."
"and er we had a plan for to build a building with er dressing accommodation and er this was gonna cost seven thousand pound when we couldn't face it, we thought that there were far more important things to deal with than that when we had housing, we had just had a housing report which said that two thousand houses in the town were not the modern standard."
"and that meant in many cases, that the toilets were out in the garden and one toilet was serving about four houses."
"and that was the traditional sort of way in galashiels, it was rather more like the rural areas than what the cities of edinburgh and glasgow are, the toilets were just outside where the old dry toilets had been."
"and er they didn't spend the money when the sewage scheme was put into the town, the, the landlords didn't spend the money on rebuilding bits of the houses."
"for some reason or other, the money would be scarce at the time."
"it, it came or it or it would be one of the depressions that the town has suffered from many times during the last fifty or sixty years."
mhm.
well we began to tackle the housing problem because this was a very big problem.
and the result was that we couldn't build the centre of the town.
"we would have liked to rebuild it but then we had to find places for the people to go and being a narrow valley it, most of the housing was put at the  end of the town."
and er some of the schemes have been criticized but it was a blessing in a way that we got them done when we did and er we were able to house a lot of people out there and release ground in the centre of the town to be redeveloped and er brought up to modern standards.
mhm.
"and er there was a stage when we came to the, where we really decided we'd have to earmark different streets, how far we were gonna go in the centre of the town, because people were beginning to get grants for altering houses, and then in another five years time the council, the council were having to buy back these houses to redevelop the area."
"so there was a stage where we did say, this scheme is going so far and anybody that buys a house out with that area, they're free to apply for grants."
"but if they, we will, we will not allow them within this area which we intend to demolish and rebuild."
mhm.
"and so it went on and the town today has er practically been either reconstructed, the centre has been reconstructed or the older buildings have been brought up to modern standards."
"er there, there'll be a very small number of houses now which are substandard, compared with what there was in nineteen fifty four when i first went on the council."
"and er on the town council i was also er on the county council because the proportional representation of the area galashiels held the whole, fifteen councillors were on the county council."
and er there was only one who couldn't take part and he was in the fire brigade and couldn't take part because they were er his employers.
"so er when i was, i was on the county council i was on the welfare committee and er in later years i was on the planning committee."
mhm.
but er the welfare one was my er secret love it was .
"because er i knew the area very well, i was er we had two committees which were composed of two counties, we had the priory committee that was a home at selkirk, a children's home, and we had berwickshire, berwickshire and selkirkshire were the owners of the priory children's home."
and i was chairman of it for about six years or so before the council broke up.
"we also had another one which was er which had been a poorhouse, turned into an old folks home and it was er peebleshire and selkirkshire."
"it had been at one time, going back over a hundred and fifty years, it had been what they called a combination poorhouse."
"and galashiels being placed where it was on the between four counties,you had berwickshire, peebleshire, roxburghshire and selkirkshire all having a part."
but roxburghshire and berwickshire came it and it was a peebleshire and selkirkshire home.
and er it was er we had to develop it from a poorhouse into an old folks' home.
which took a very long time.
"we, we tackled it without putting a great lot on the rates, we were a, we were able to tackle it year by year by altering some of the rooms."
"adding er dining rooms and er sitting rooms for the old folk, and er also trying to break up the wards into smaller units."
but er this place er was called  view and it's now been er vacated and a new home has been built at the  in the  park.
and it's.
and what was it what were these homes for mr ?
well er old folk who couldn't look after themselves.
"but originally i can remember that  view in the days of the, when it was a poorhouse, and i visited with my mother who used to visit a woman up there."
"and it was a very bare place then, wooden seats and wooden tables and long trestle tables and er that's, i have very faint memories of it ."
"but when we took it over the, one of the first things we did was to redesign the kitchen because the soup was made in these great  boiler and it was probably heated up every day of the week and  can imagine what it would be like being in  prison."
". however that was all changed and er that was the first thing we changed and erm then we erm, during the period we, the staff were changed, mr and mrs  who are now, they came as a young couple to  view and er i think with their coming, they had different ideas and the place did seem to change."
"that's, this, are we talking about the, the late fifties?"
or later on?
yes.
"er the late fifties early sixties i should say, yes."
"they just, the early sixties i would say probably sixty two or sixty three when they, they came i think."
"and er we took away all the iron beds, put wooden beds, we put little wardrobes in the rooms and these tackling it bit by bit each year you see."
"not without throwing a great lot onto the rates because the rates were just selkirkshire, and peebleshire had to keep it up then and er we didn't er get grants for it in these days."
"and er so peebles had their separate homes, we also had a separate one at  side and then we also built the, the one at er  lodge which is another part of the  park."
these were er built the that long period that i was on the council.
"er i was chairman of that committee , view when, when, during quite a long period, until the whole system was changed to the council system like and went onto er and er there was one of our, our er officer who was welfare was a mr  who had a great knowledge of both selkirk and galashiels and the country and er he was known by everybody."
"and a very great man he was and he, before he he had died, he didn't reach retirement, he died before he retired which, and we missed him very much indeed."
"and er  i didn't have a lot to do with roads or anything like that or education, it was mainly welfare that was my, the, the."
come in.
good morning doctor.
good morning.

"this is an oral history project tape, my name is  and i am interviewing  of  ipswich."
this is tape one of recording number two of the ipswich transport project.
the date is the eighth of june nineteen eighty seven.
"right, oh thank you mr ."
mm i wonder if you would start of by telling me where you were born?
"yes, well er  i'm ipswich bred and born."
i was actually erm born in  although most of  is gone now for the development of the  grounds.
"the house that i was actually born in is still there, number twenty five er after a while i moved across the road to a bigger house when, cos my mother had another son and a daughter and then we moved over to the , so when we were quite in the stoke area."
"stoke area was chosen i suppose because my father worked on the railway and you either worked on the railway  or  if  you lived over stoke, it was well known for that."
erm twenty second of july nineteen sixteen so i'm a first war baby.
"i then er, we then broke away and went the er, i suppose it's the, i don't know what part of the, but it's the dales, that's where i moved to then and then to  because my dad couldn't, getting on in years, he couldn't take the hills up  and then from  i got married and we moved into this address here and then that was the day after war was declared that i got married."
"thirty, thirty nine."
"yes, yeah fourth of september nineteen thirty nine and course erm the erm and six months after the,to the day really, i erm went into the forces and served in the army for just over six years."
"right, well  did you, you went to school obviously locally?"
yes.
when did you leave school?
"well, actually i left school, i think it was the either tenth or eleventh of november nineteen thirty one and i went straight into the transport department and i think my record will show that i actually started there on the twelfth of november nineteen thirty one."
why is it that you went straight from school into.
well er i.
did you apply to go?
"no i didn't apply, i erm, although i was interviewed for the job."
"how it turned out was that we er, i was attending the, what was called the  secondary modern school and we'd moved premises from  ."
well i was a bleeding age but i hadn't got a job and erm i decided to keep on and we actually used a lot of our august summer holidays to help move the stuff from  to  school.
"i hung on there until, well my fifteenth birthday was in the july and it was november before i actually left."
"what happened was i happened to be in the corridors there and the gentleman came in, that's on the friday afternoon, gentleman came in and asked to see the headmaster, so i took him along to see  who was the headmaster then, and erm shortly after that i was called up to see  and erm asked me if i'd like to apply for this job because  had seen me erm bringing me , bringing him up to see  and he said erm, well what about that young fella who brought me up there and would he like to apply."
so i went down there and er well i suppose fell in love with the job right away.
"it was good, everybody had told me that erm, you know, you didn't get very much money when you left school, about ten shillings and to offer me fifteen shillings i thought was this world, so erm."
what did you actually start as?
"well i suppose a very junior clerk, the first job i was given was, well it's unheard of in this day and age but what they had was what they call a bundi clock and there every driver and conductor had got a key that was inserted in this clock and on it was his personal number, well  when he reported for duty, he inserted this key into the clock, turned the handle and stamped a piece of paper, a roll of paper, his number and the time he reported and the next day it was my job to go through and record from this piece of paper how many minutes they were late reporting for duty and if they erm were more than, i think about three or four minutes we had to send them a memo telling them, that's how things were in those days that people were, they toed the line or else."
"so it was a case there, and course at the end of the day you rolled the little roll up, put elastic round and stood them up in a file and they stood there like little  soldiers  and you could always go back to the actual time, sometimes you found a man hadn't erm signed on, he'd just gone and joined his bus up in town centre, well you, that was er subject of another letter."
"so, you know, they were very strict in those days."
"erm, that carried on for a while, i thought i was doing very very well, being able to do a job like that."
"it's the first job  i'd ever had  you see, and then erm i, i suppose my next job was erm recording the bus mileage."
"in those days they didn't use mileometers, what they did was they took any particular route number and the number of journeys they did, because in those days a bus kept on a route which applied, say between witton and rushmere heath all day, didn't run around like they do nowadays and erm when the schedules were prepared, each bus had got a route number or was placed on a route number, say one witton, two witton, three witton and a copy of its schedule was recorded on another sheet and the mileage, having known what the mileage was and we'd used to obtain that from the borough surveyor's department, er i think it was about nine point one four miles a return trip witton and rushmere heath, er you'd work out how many journeys they did there and say well that bus was due to run a hundred and twenty six miles during the day."
"well sometimes they didn't do that for reason, perhaps a driver missed his duty or there was a defect on the bus and you used to get a record each day of what we call lost mileage or an extra mileage perhaps on the odd occasion when an extra journey was run but erm the lost mileage was recorded and say you had this bus was due to run a hundred and twenty six miles, it didn't for some reason complete its erm hundred percent journey, you'd take that off and then record against that bus that, that run say hundred and twenty miles."
"now that was, the reason that all this mileage was done because that mileage is the basis for which all statistical information is recorded."
"speeds per mile, pence per mile, cost per mile and everything is erm referred back to the mileage run by an undertaking during its year, week or what have you."
"it also, in those days was mileage for the tyres was paid on the number of miles run per tyre, so at the end of the month you could record, you knew what tyres were on a certain bus, you knew of how many miles that bus had done, so you recorded that particular tyre on that bus had run so many miles and it was that that we paid for our tyres that way."
i think it was round about a ha'penny a mile in those days.
"we had to pay er there was two lots of erm tyres, there was one set of buses were fitted with  and another one with  or  i forget which it was there but i know those three were involved at some time or other and we used to record the mileage, send it off to them, showing what each bus ran during the month."
how many days it was service and this that and the other and erm they used to send us an invoice on the mileage run because at the same time we knew what tyres were on the bus we had to inform them of any tyre changes and they kept records the same as us.
so you didn't actually buy the tyres then you were an overseer.
"no we didn't buy tyres, no they were tyre mileage rates and erm mileage was the, tyres were paid for on the mileage run."
how long did that go on for?
"oh, it did, went on for the time i retired."
"it maybe still the same now, erm because right the time i erm retired we, we had on occasions to pay for the residual value of a tyre, perhaps a bus had been in accident and the tyre had suffered damage which it wasn't possible to repair it or retread it, perhaps a hole had been pierced through the wall, they scrapped that tyre and we had to pay for the residual value, mind you being in accident we could then claim it off the insurance company but, so right the time i retired that's how tyres were paid for."
"i mean we could never have paid for all those tyres and when i retired the erm, they actually had a tyre fitter supplied and paid for by  they were the, they took over the whole of the tyre maintenance, they had a tyre fitter down there and he used to go depot, change any tyres that were necessary, he inspected them each day and changed them over but he was notifying erm  at the same time."
"over the years we didn't have quite so much work to do with recording which tyre was on which bus because he took it over, but it was right up until i retired in, well five years ago that we were paying tyres that way."
where actually were you working?
"in this early part, where were you."
"at , i never moved from there."
"we erm, we hadn't got a lot of room for expansion down there, we were in, when i joined the department it was known as the ipswich electric supply and transport department and er  we were in some buildings which were rented from the electric supply department which housed the generators for the electricity, so we hadn't got a lot of room for expansion there, i think we were all confined into about three offices."
what were they like  well the facilities there like?
"well they were two storey buildings, we had one office which was partitioned off for us clerks and the other half was for the traffic superintendent who was responsible, directly responsible to the general manager of the ipswich electric supply and transport departments, so erm and then we had another office adjoining that which was a store room because in those days we used to have to erm record and keep in safekeeping all lost property,no end of things we used to have  but we, you know, we used to have pigeon holes and lost property that was brought in, was placed into these pigeon holes it'd be monday, tuesday, wednesday."
"we'd keep them for a fortnight in those pigeon holes because most people claim stuff if they realize where they'd left it within a day or two and then as the weeks went round we used to take stuff there and just lump it altogether, having duly labelled it up and erm record it and  used to have tuppence an item if anybody  lost anything."
"odd gloves we never used to charge for  had to get rid of them and er so those two offices er there was immediately above us was a biggish office spreading over these two blocks of offices, called the ticket office and there at that time about eleven girls working in it on tickets."
er nearer the actual bus garage was what was called the depot office and the paying in room.
now the depot office they in those days controlled what a man's duties were for the next day and a man didn't know what he was on until about twelve o'clock one day what he was on the next day.
"in those days a man was allocated duties, it is true they tried to arrange that he was on early spread, medium or late duties but it didn't always work out holidays, sickness or  that but erm there were no restriction on hours."
in those days a man would run in about half past eleven at night and he could very well be on an early shift the next day.
"there was no sort of law against erm employing people without a certain amount of rest and erm that was employed, er that was occupied that office from first thing in the morning when the bus went out from five o'clock  and erm he would, the depot clerk would go off round about dinner time, there'd be his relief who came on at nine o'clock and worked with him until dinner time and he'd carry on till five and then we had, what was called, the cashiers come on duty then, there was a cashier and erm a hand."
"it was a shed hand actually, he didn't, wasn't responsible for cash although he helped the cashier and er, i well remember this erm  in those days the conductor used to either run into depot with the bus or he'd get relief on the cornhill, he walked down to the depot carrying his cash in his cash bag and then he'd sit in the paying in room and he'd laboriously carried out his cash, piling the pennies into stacks, the ha'pennies, the tokens, the sixpences, every denomination."
then he would place them on one of the old time boards which was er board about nine inches by nine inches and then hand that through the pigeon hole to the cashier and him that cashier would laboriously count that money and agree the total there and then.
"you can well imagine when all the buses ran eleven and half past eleven that there was a mad scramble to get their cash in and  someone , very often somebody's cash would get knocked off the board, so there was a scramble on the floor."
"but that's how cash was counted in those days and erm, the waybill was marked to agree with a man's statement of what his cash added and then the cash next day was counted up bolt because there was priory heath to take care of, although that wasn't a media when i first went down there, that opened later on, but there was the two got to be married together and then conveyed to the bank the next day, or, on the monday if it was a saturday or sunday."
"but that sort of thing went on in those days, money was physically handled all the time."
"it was in the later days that you gradually got the  the buses were then fitted with these, these safes, they've got the safes on the ticket machines on the buses, whereby every man's cash working on that bus that day went into a vault on the bus."
"the vaults were then changed at night or when the bus had finished service and then were counted by a different means, they were counted by machine coin counters and er so, say erm what, sixty or seventy conductors paying in their money, this was all erm on the bus, so there may have been five or six drivers had worked that bus that day and all the takings he'd taken during the time was all in this night safe in this vault."
"so er, you know, things did progress a great deal."
"with so much cash about, was there any, any problems with security?"
"no, because er i always put it down to the fact that most of our takings were in coin, it was very seldom that you had a pound note, you possibly had a ten pound note in those days but most of it was coinage and the cash when it was married up, was put into steel bound wooden boxes."
"they was made that two men had to lift 'em, so there was hardly likely that any thief was gonna get in there and run off with one of these boxes cos you'd never lift it."
"so, you know, it, it, it, never at any time was paper money to the fore, you didn't get very much."
"the most time was on fridays when the drivers and conductors or fitters, everybody used to get their pay packet which was mostly in notes they would immediately go to the depot  and say, can i  change it ."
"so that's, that's the only time that we really had lots and lots of notes."
did you have to wear a uniform to go to work?
"not me, no the drivers and conductors and inspectors, they had a uniform and it was seen that they did wear it."
"just before my time down there, if a man reported for work with a dirty collar or something like that you were sent home."
"he wasn't allowed to work that day, so people turned up in a white shirt and tie and looking smart, they had to wear uniforms even a cap but unfortunately nowadays, although a lot of i have seen quite a few people their uniform has changed since i left, but erm they do come to work in very very casual work now."
"casual wear, jeans and  open necked shirts , no caps,."
mm.
but erm.
"there was no, no uniform for the office, so you had to provide your own?"
"no, no just went in ordinary civilian wear, girls sometimes had some overalls because they were handling the ticket boxes, they were metal, they got wet, they rusted up and that was a filthy job for there was really, in those days it was a two box system, a man drew his box which contained a certain amount of tickets of different variable classes and erm, it was listed on a waybill, he was given a half an hour to check his box and join his bus at town centre."
"so he, he sat in the mess room there and checked his box against the tickets which were shown on the waybill."
if he agreed it he signed it and put the which that was called a total waybill.
he placed it in the box and that eventually returned itself to the ticket office.
"he also had another er, what we call a journey waybill and that, he used to record on there at each termini he used to record the time and the ticket numbers that he'd got in his rack at that particular time, so it could be seen between certain times that a ticket perhaps was sold between witton and rushmere heath."
"we didn't ask them to do electric house because that would have meant that you'd gotta have enough lines there to take a bus timing every half an hour because witton, well every quarter of an hour really."
"witton to electric house quarter of an hour, electric house to rushmere heath, quarter of an hour and it did the reverse direction."
"so it  meant every quarter of an hour you were asking a man to record his numbers, so we boiled it down to termini."
"witton, rushmere, vauxhall road, london road and those sort of places."
"so that was the journey waybill and that was handed in at the end of the day and from that and a visual check of the tickets that were returned by him to the ticket office, they could tell which tickets were missing and therefore they were sold to him and er  there be, there was the odd shortages but in those days if anybody was short in his takings by, i think it was about sixpence in those days, he was the subject of another warning by letter and if he persisted, well then he was brought in to see the traffic superintendent who erm, could suspend him for two or three days, so he lost pay for two or three days."
"discipline was very very strict in those days but with the war coming on and lots of those men going to the forces, things changed drastically during that time and discipline was somewhat more lax after the war."
"every one of those men who went in the forces, who lived to tell the tale, was given their jobs back when they came back, because their jobs were replaced by women during the war, drivers and conductors, they were replaced by women and as the men came back, so the women were paid off, so everybody who came back from the war was given their job back."
"so before the war you, you did the mileages and you did the clocking on and clocking off."
yes yes.
what other jobs did you do?
"well lost property, i already touched on, that was one of my jobs and then  erm, we called it the ticket book, that was for want of some other name i suppose."
it was the record per week of the different classes of tickets that were sold.
"penny, tuppence, three ha'penny returns and every denomination of tickets was recorded you showed the erm number of tickets, erm it was possible for at the end of the week to record what the takings were, per route and the mileage and so, as i told you before, the mileage played a great importance in that you were able to say how much that route was producing per mile run and the erm,in those days  it, the erm  the receipts worked out, daily receipts, weekly receipts and the progressive total in that year, were always published by the ipswich evening star, round about tuesday or wednesday and if you missed them, there'd be member of the public ringing why, answer why  you hadn't put it in , it was, you know, looked upon then you were, were public transport and the public  team  that you belonged to them."
they thought they had the right to boss you around.
"i pay for your salaries, cos we were, in those days, on the rates."
"any erm deficiency at the end of the financial year was made up by a rate demand, erm so the it wasn't the same in all municipal undertakings, some of them were allowed to carry forward their balances but ipswich, whether it was erm, er by law or er a, oh i don't know what it be, perhaps needed that they got to be, the erm balance of the year had to be balanced at the end of the year, so you had a rate demand and that rate demand went the next year's rates."
"so more often than not we were on the rates and the public say, oh i'm paying your  salaries ."
"so you can imagine that erm, er during the war ,they buses made  because they made to the trolley buses made plenty of money because erm, labour was cheap and erm, you had the soldiers they were, lot of them, no other form of transport, petrol rationing and that, so the buses really did come into their own during the war."
"during this during, before the war, it was trolley buses?"
"yes, yes."
when did the motor buses come in?
i think the first ones we had were about nineteen thirty six i believe.
"my memory doesn't er, is not all that clear on it."
but there were certainly trolley buses when i went there in nineteen thirty one and trolley buses first came in in nineteen twenty three and it was all trolley buses by nineteen twenty six.
"erm, motor buses came in, i, i can't recall, i think now on reflection that it was after the war, motor buses came in."
"erm nineteen forty eight, forty nine, something like that."
"i, i couldn't be adamant about the date of those but er the reason that motor buses came in is because it was too costly to extend trolley bus routes."
"with, with putting up new, new cables?"
"yes,you've got to extend the route, well you've got to put up, trolley poles every about forty yards and then there was two lengths of trolley wire that had to go because as you know trolley buses used to have two arms, positive and negative supply and er, the bus had to come back er alongside the the outward route, it come on, so you had four wires up there and the cost of copper wire was terrific so the motor buses were developed and we experimented with the buses on, on extensions mainly but when the extensions were finished we then begradged because trolley wires were then beginning to wear out, replace them they would convert a trolley route into a bus route, and erm because the erm, there was a lot of people hated to see the demise of the trolley buses because they were so clean and silent  and the buses came, you got the deal sloke and lumbering of the old engines, that a lot of people hated to see the trolley buses go but cos that was the, the reason that they went."
"they were very very reliable because erm, the motive power was in a motor, electric motor, not a lot of parts to go wrong but er once you started the motor buses they had to send people away to  to be taught the mechanics of motor buses, so you had the old die-hards of the fetters, trolley buses, who never did take to motor buses and course the younger ones came into their own then, who were able to adapt to the modern motor bus."
do you remember what you were paid at the outbreak of the war?
"well, yes, i, i, i did merely remark about it, i think i got fifteen shillings per week."
that was when you started in nineteen thirty one?
"yeah, when i started in nineteen thirty one and in those days you got a rise every six months and i got a one and three rise after they'd been there six months and at the year i was earning seventeen and six."
now i got married in nineteen thirty nine and my wage then was forty eight and sixpence and that's how my wages were and erm.
"how did that wage compare to the, to drivers and, and conductors?"
"well it was a wee bit under because i was only an office clerk, i, i wasn't the junior but by then  had come there and there were other, other clerks, some girls who'd come into the office and i'd got a little bit of step up you see and took over a little bit more important work, erm, i did just before i went in the army have a dabble at erm running times, that was preparing the schedules for buses."
for some unknown reason before the war we used to have a route change every year.
"if the buses ran from bramford road to lattice barn one year, they'd decide they'd send them from bramford road to bourne bridge the next."
"they were always changing them to try and balance up the take i suppose, on each, each leg of the route and there was always  was the chief clerk then and him and i got on very well together and he really initiated me into running times."
"i didn't do very important part of it because erm, it was, sometimes you'd get the same sort of schedule."
"a bus would repeat itself every hour and he'd say, run that one down, or that was running it down hour after hour until about seven o'clock when certain buses were run in."
"the other buses were either spread out in their running time or cut down to form the evening frequency which was less than what it was during the peak time and so i, you know, i'd, i'd left it at then, when i went in the forces then, he carried on."
"i came the forces, he was only waiting for the time that i came out, for him to retire."
"he hung on until i came out and i was given embarkation leave or demob leave rather and i didn't even have a chance to have that, they wanted me down there so quickly, i think i came the forces one week and i was working down there the following week because  was way past his retiring age."
"though er, i really got into that, i was forced into it, i never had a time to think about it, i was wanted there, i  who was the traffic superintendent then."
he was very very tolerant with me and he brought me back into it without a lot of undue pressure and erm because transport wasn't my life but i'd dedicated myself to it.
"i, i got stuck in, i used to bring stuff home at night to work on and er there were no exams to sit then, you just sort or did it by, you either could or you couldn't do it."
that's on disk.
what did you actually do during the war?went away?
well.
is that transport related or.
"no, it wasn't transport related, i knew that my, my group, because everybody was placed in a certain group by age and, er i knew that i was due to go and i thought oh well this is hanging around you wanted to get on with it."
"i volunteered for the grenadier guards, well i had to go to chelsea barracks and after a week there, they decided that i wasn't medically fit for them, although the doctor or the m o at the ipswich recruiting officer said, oh yes, you're a one you'll be fine for the guard but cos i was fairly well built, stature wise."
"oh, yes, you're just the sort of bloke we're looking for for the guards."
"so i fell for it and i volunteered for the guards, but after a week, they decided i, i'd got flat feet  which wasn't  very good for slamming your foot down as the guards demanded in those days."
"i came back on the friday night and erm, well i've packed my job in at the transport department, i better go down to the recruiting office and see what else."
"well, having been downgraded to a two from a one erm i said well what else can i volunteer for, cos i didn't fancy going back to work and then being called up again."
"so i erm, i erm, was put into the royal army pay corp and posted barnet, north london and i was there for quite a while, we all transferred down to winchester."
"well we went into the rifle brigade barracks at winchester and used to work out at a big house winchester so we had to march out there and then at the time of dunkirk, they were looking for places to put all the soldiers that they'd brought and er, we were cleared barnet, er winchester barracks and posted nottingham and we worked in the  factory, which was taken over by the army then and erm, and then whilst there, i suppose that was about nineteen what, about nineteen coming nineteen forty two, they decided to have a recheck or rethink on medicals, so we were all another medical and they put me back to a one and says, right we're getting rid of all a one personnel the pay corp, you have a choice royal army ordnance corp or the royal artillery."
well my brother was in the artillery and i thought well it be nice if i can get with him but that didn't work out that way.
"i was posted to the er ack-ack brigade  and i was posted to norwich, just at norwich,coldershaw really."
at the brigade h q.
"having served as sort of er apprentice there as an artillery clerk, i was put, posted woolwich to go through a erm clerk's course."
"i was up there for six weeks, i passed the course and was posted back to brigade h q to a wider posting to a regiment."
"my posting came through and i was  posted  to swordstone this side of norwich, so i was still quids in, i could get home once a week, twenty four hour pass and then erm after a while erm, having served at regiment, i was posted , as the sergeant artillery clerk with the brigade, an ack-ack brigade up at coventry, just outside coventry and then the a t s were coming in, were coming in in quite large numbers then and they were replacing male personnel and then i was posted abroad and i went to egypt where i was there again, fortunate enough, i suppose, to go into the echelon, the second echelon which was the records office of all the forces or the armoured personnel in the middle east and i worked there until i was actually demobbed from there but i was out in egypt there for two, just over two years, came back to northampton where i was finally demobbed and allowed to come home and as i said i came home one week and i was back at work the next."
so i was actually messing around with the tax officer for quite a while because i was on demob leave and i was also  working  so he wasn't gonna let me have two lots of  wages.
"how had the transport changed then in that period you were away, five years?"
what were the changes that you noticed?
"well,."
had things been allowed to run down over the war?
"no, no but erm erm, the only real difference was that lots and lots of the trolley buses were of the utility type."
"they were made to wartime restrictions, wooden seats and erm mass produced really, erm there was none of the erm cushioned seats , that were a part of the feature during before the war."
we had lots and lots of trolley buses and er  who was the general manager had sought powers to run all over ipswich.
"oh the by-pass road, you know the northern part of ipswich, along the by-pass and had ordered trolley buses, because you had to order 'em about two years time, erm, to take care of that but it didn't materialize and we had a surplus of buses and some of them were sold off, i think some went to walsall, some to wolverhampton and er i, i think it was one of those that was sold to woolwich, figured in the national newspapers that had toppled over."
"it er gone on its side but erm, i i wouldn't say that things had deteriorated that much."
"it was erm, they had expanded, they brought in the clapgut lane route during the war."
as they say things were different during the war.
"if it was er public transport, certain facilities were afforded to public transport which went to private enterprise erm the nature of taking factory workers to the ammunition factories and such like."
"but i wouldn't say that er, that it had deteriorated."
"mind you the, the erm, the wages had risen  quite during the time."
i was fortunate in that i was married before the war and the ipswich council had decided that married men's wages would be made up.
"erm, so i was constantly getting rises, less my service pay and erm it got to a state there where sometimes my service pay was more than what the erm salary i would have got at home was and my wife had to pay to keep my superannuation live."
she had.
you turn it up.
"fears i er i'm coming back from the forces i went into the main job, taking over from the previous scheduled clerk by breaking the schedules and the duties."
the duties being erm what a man had to do to cover that er period of that scheduling.
"as i said before a bus was on a certain route number, say you had one witton what was had now and then, well that  that ran from six o'clock in the morning perhaps till eleven o'clock at night."
had to be manned by a driver and a conductor for that day.
well obviously he couldn't work six in the morning till eleven at night.
"so you had to have, in that day erm, about five men to cover one bus right the way through, can you  just a moment."
five men during the whole day.
"erm why i say five men, you might think that peculiar because there was a man and a conductor each time but we used to reckon that two buses, full-time buses would be scheduled by or run by ten men because there one man would come off at nine o'clock, have a relief of hour and fifteen minutes and then another one would take over from him."
"so it's er, how we used to marry them up was  erm two long buses as we called  would take ten men to do five duties."
"erm, then the erm, the insistence of the driver's conductors was they didn't like the long periods of duty  they erm, they wanted the new set up so i introduced what we call straight duties, narrowed the relief portion, so they didn't go home for a meal, they had about a half an hour off, so they were able to get their eight hour duty done in a shorter period and they'd probably finish about two half past three, four o'clock."
"at this time then after the war, how many vehicles were there running?"
oh dear  i suppose seventy odd a day.
"and how many men would that, would you employ?"
"i think at erm, at the peak time there was about two hundred and twenty six drivers and conductors."
"erm, when, when i came back out the forces, a man's guaranteed week was a forty hour, forty eight hour week."
"it went down to forty six, they negotiated things that er reduced it to forty six."
"it went down to forty four, forty two and now i believe they are on a forty hour week."
"whether they've got down to thirty eight, i don't know but it was a forty hour week when i finally left."
"so and then erm, they start bringing in one man buses and the conductors were required."
"now er i could make a point here that when they introduced one man operated buses, they thought they were a new thing but one man operated buses were in this town before the war."
trolley buses had one man to do it.
now they thought they were in a new thing in  nineteen fifties when they brought in one man operated buses but they weren't.
"there's only one person on a trolley bus,."
yes.
there's no conductor then?
"the, they used to put a conductor on for peak time and then about nine o'clock the rear door was closed and the driver took over issuing tickets, taking money  and then perhaps the conductor would come on from about twelve or two and then again, perhaps from half past four till half past six."
"so a conductor's duty weren't very very nice then, probably three piece duties, which were spread duties but you know people thought they were bringing in a wonderful thing to be one man operated but it was before the war that we had one man operated buses."
"cos i remember the duties, there used to be a driver you would get more pay for bringing the bus, one man, so underneath each duty was just how many, how many hours he was one man and how many two men."
"so it's, it wasn't a new thing when they brought but nevertheless erm that went on and on and on then and er cos the staff really went down, the requirements for staff went down and erm i, i think erm, they got it down when i left there to round about a hundred and forty six staff was, was all that was required."
"mm how many were, were in the office at this time?"
was the clerical work still there?
"no erm the, the clerical erm staff on the erm, shall we say the traffic side increased because er there was more and more demanding work but the ticket office, they went down, erm i have mentioned perhaps before that they had the two box system and there was about eleven, twelve, thirteen girls in there and their duty was to check a box that had been used one day, stock it up with tickets, get it ready for the day after."
"so there was constantly two books, two boxes going."
"at the same time they had on mondays and tuesday we used to sell weekly tickets, so they had to go out in another box on mondays and tuesdays."
"then there was plenty of work for them but then when the erm, the one man buses really got going and they introduced the night safe on the buses, the ticket office was cut drastically, they didn't need to have all this information."
we had waybills that we could extract this information from but it wasn't so accurate because man wasn't required to record the erm numbers of each class of ticket.
"all we were concerned was, was the total ticket registers."
"we could get certain information recorded from the ticket machines, of just how many of different types of tickets were issued because what we'd, they had double readings."
"a man when he issued say two, two tuppeny tickets,there were two tuppeny tickets but he pushed a little lever and issued two tuppeny tickets which came out almost together, that was a fourpenny fare and that would record once."
mm.
on little numerator.
"so we were able to tell how many tickets of certain classes were sold each day but not route by route, we'd lost that  that facility because the waybills just weren't big enough and the,everything got mechanical but now i mean i don't profess to know anything about what happens now but i was introduced to it when i went down there for a retirement  and believe me it's, it's all electronics now they can tell how a ticket machine is issuing tickets at any particular one day by this, this electronic business, this computers."
so they really brought it down to a very fine art now.
"was the,were there trade unions in, in, in the transport department at this time, were they quite active?"
"oh yes, yes the erm, the main one was the transport and general workers' union which erm, did all the drivers, conductors and cleaners and semi-skilled staff but erm you had the erm n u v b which is the national union and vehicle builders and you had the electrical trades people, so they, they were all working in there but the main one covering most of the men was the transport and general workers' union."
"now the office staff, there was no closed shop there but our union was nalgo."
the national association of local government officers.
i don't know whether you in .
"well that was the, the erm union for us, erm i think erm one of the great assets of being in public transport was that we were in a local erm pension scheme, erm when, when we in the office started, we had to wait until we were eighteen and then we had to wait for a vacancy because there was a limited number of people that the council were prepared to back by paying a similar amount."
"drivers and conductors had to wait three years, they had to be employed three years before they were accepted into the pension scheme but you know, believe me i'm glad that i paid in for it."
"it was a bit of a pill at the time and used to pay a shilling in the pound, well a shilling was  more valuable  than it is now and erm i used to begrudge paying in it forty eight and sixpence but it does provide the, well the pleasures of life now, whereby the the ordinary old age pension wouldn't."
"erm i told you that erm during the war if my army wage went above what the recorded salary was, my wife had to pay to keep the superannuation going."
"and when i see the buses now running around, they seem to run everywhere i don't on earth what kind of running board they've got because in my day it was so well regulated that erm you just recorded certain intermediate stages and i quote witton and rushmere you get, used to get witton terminus, norwich road bridge, sherrington road, barret corner, electric house and you gave an indication of the time that those buses should be passing those times."
"er and then we'd used to repeat right the way through the day, we had a bus say for sixteen hours and it erm repeated itself every hour  and that was boring job  just writing it down and repeating it."
so what was a running board then?
"a running board was the information given to the driver of what, where he was expected to run, what time he was expected to leave the various termini."
"they it's erm,."
they were prepared by the office and given to each driver daily?
"well there were running boards, they were, they were written out, well eventually,were typed out but they were written out and first of all  it was really funny we used to size them these wooden boards, let that dry, then varnish them and that board was used day in day out."
a man used to hand it back in when the bus ran in and it was given out the next day.
it eventually got that they were typed and put into cellophane covers which made it easier.
"it was funny in my day, when i first started there you used to get, mix up some size and er in a pot, in a proper pot and take it down into the mess room and put it on the stove, coal stove, heat it up and  you let it boil was a terrific smell about the place  you can imagine,the size but that's what we used to do in those days."
"things were much easier then but all these running boards were, were interpreted, if that's the right word, on the master scheduling."
"now you used to say perhaps there's an hourly service, er an hourly run from witton to rushmere and back again and you wanted a ten minute service."
well that would take six buses to do that.
"six tens being sixty and they were all prepared in a master schedule, you'd write down twelve o'clock, twelve ten, twelve twenty, erm that sort of thing you see."
mm.
"and then each, that would take six buses, one, two, three, four, five, six wittons we used to call them and then the running board was a copy from that of all what number one witton was gotta do."
"so from a mass master timetable, each bus, route number was interpreted a what we called a running board and er it was that that the driver ran to."
"you got complications some time in that erm when the six a twos, the fours and the six b routes were running erm it was found sometimes that if you married them together, did a six a trip one time a six b, a two and four, you could save what we call a bus, you could save a whole bus by marrying them together because routes were only of thirty minute duration from electric house out to six a gainsborough and back again was, was half an hour."
"now  you could have two buses doing that and forming fifteen minute service because one bus went out in thirty minutes another one fifteen minutes behind it, that came back the first bus was able to do the third one."
"now if you want to decrease the frequency, say at evenings, and you wanted a twenty minute service, you can see that you're in all kinds of muddle."
"it was fifty, it's thirty minutes to do the run, you only wanted a bus to repeat itself every forty minutes, so you got ten minutes to waste."
"you couldn't afford to have drivers  sitting around for ten minutes not doing anything, so you married these routes up together and were able to, by manipulation, get them to a more economical run."
"er, but the running boards did look very complicated because on one half an hour he'd probably go and do a six a run, another one a six b run, a two and a four."
"you can imagine that some drivers er went the wrong way, and  it was just that they, they just didn't concentrate on the run but nowadays they seem to run all over the town."
so how on earth they keep them to a schedule i do not know but i don't want to know now .
"what was the social life like, was there a social club?"
there was a very very strong social club.
"was the general manager then, he was very very keen on sport and erm in nineteen thirty eight, er saw the opening of the erm sports ground at barragh close, flindburgh road."
"i remember because in nineteen thirty eight, er we were scheduled to have an opening in about the september and we got a team coming down to play us at football and we were going to have a social evening, darts and that, at, in the evening and at that particular time, the war was a definite threat."
you remember chamberlain.
yes.
"and his white piece of paper, so everything was cancelled."
er to the team that was gonna come down from london and i was secretary of the football club at that time.
"said erm, oh we must have something."
"so i, i rang the power station people at norwich and they sent up a team to open it."
"so it was in nineteen thirty eight that the, the erm sports ground at priory heath was opened."
"now erm   was the instigator of the ipswich interfirm cup and erm, in those days if there was any erm going begging at portman road, would give them a job on the, the gangs."
"the electricity cable laying  to give 'em a job so you could play for the ipswich electric supply team and we had a jolly good team, we won the cup for the first three years that it was in being but the finals used to be on portman road and course that was in those days a thing to be looked forward to."
"erm there was the cricket, there was bowls, tennis, swimming section, gardening section."
the swimming section was more or less brought back to mind to me the other day when they showed the old stoke bathing place.
"though we that was over stoke worstead road way, when we used to have the open air swimming pool there."
"it was only water that was let into a confined space but we had a sports association which had a section for the swimming and er i way remember  bought a couple of old single decker buses from somewhere, i don't know where and he had them fitted out and rigged up at stoke bathing place, especially for us to go there and change and we did have quite a good strong section, we used to hold our, an annual what you call a regatta, or, no not a regatta but er in the st matthew's swimming baths a festival, a swimming festival a gala, yes."
mm.
"and you know we could, in those days the number of people employed being electric supply and transport, we could erm, manage to keep it a viable proposition for an evening's entertainment then and erm,you probably can turn this up in the, the star they're showing erm   as he was then, one of the drivers swimming from erm stoke bathing place to felixstowe."
"er i was, i think i've got pictures about it somewhere or that was in the evening star not so very many years ago."
"they've got pictures of it, of him preparing all greased up."
"it was our, our answer to  cross channel swimming ."
"he, he did it once or twice, had to give up when he got to the mouth of the river orwell because he mistimed the currents but he did, he did eventually do it from stoke bathing place to felixstowe."
it was a long swim in those days.
at what stage did they split the power and the transport?
"oh,at nineteen forty eight they split up the electric supply and the three was nationalized and erm it, it just went the control of the local councils, it was government controlled then and there was a distinct possibility that the transport section would be sold off to private enterprise and the only private enterprise that was capable of taking over then was the eastern counties but erm i think the, the erm local council having had the transport under their wing for so many years, fought off that erm feeling and erm they kept with it and er, all the accountancy went to the borough treasurer and the certain members of clerks from the borough treasurers, which was at  in those days, er seconded transport accounts."
"so we were really answerable to the ipswich borough council, to private enterprise which some people really wanted to sell us off as being a, you know, a weight round their necks because if we didn't make a lot of money after the war, the accounts would show that we were making a deficiency every year and erm, well there was no way that you could recoup it because our routes weren't really long enough to charge lots of fares erm, maybe tuppence was the town centre to the extreme termini."
mm.
"and, and you know you couldn't get a lot of money, although nationally, the rates of pay were governed nationally, they were going up and up and up and there was no way that we could keep pace, we couldn't keep on increasing the tuppeny fare."
"they are increased now obviously but erm, you know to put anything on a tuppeny fare then was well a ha'penny which was twenty five percent on  terrible, every year we were going for a fare increase and in those days you really had to go through the traffic commissioners."
you had to go to cambridge.
loads and loads of information had to be supplied.
"you had to satisfy the traffic commissioners, that what you are proposing would, would answer the cause, wouldn't give rise to erm great hardships to the travelling public and erm oh you're preparing a fare increase about a year before it actually came , the commissioners and then he would erm, perhaps make some alterations or give you a date when you could apply."
"you had to then notify the public twenty twenty four i, no fourteen days before it was due to come in."
"everybody then had the right to make erm protests against this and could be heard at cambridge, protesting about fare increases."
"so it wasn't a very easy thing then to get them and as i say you'd be preparing a fare increase which, perhaps a ha'penny on certain fares and a penny on fares above a certain range and you had to allow for depreciation, or resistance in the public travelling but er you could always bring in extra from a fare increase it was worthwhile going forward."
"as i say it was very very difficult in those days, you had to satisfy the traffic commissions."
"so,in the fifties  across to be one man operated buses?"
yes.
"what were the changes that followed that, that then?"
how did it develop in the sixties?
"was it, the town was growing then?"
well the town was growing then.
"as i said the er, the trolley buses were being phased out and the buses, the motor buses were being used more than ever and i don't know the date of the last trolley bus running but i well remember it being reported time, it was the erm, bus was packed on its last journey from electric house and people were photographing it."
it was its last run and it finished up at priory heath  erm  was on the gainsborough route.
the last ones to be motorized and erm.
why those routes?
"well i suppose it because, as i told you, those four routes were always treated as a separate entity because they were on, there were possible chances of marrying those routes together to get them to run the most economical way."
"there was four routes there now and we had as many as ten buses operating those four, so it meant they were left, you couldn't segregate them."
you couldn't say well we will have motor buses on the fourth and not the other three because they were so closely interwoven.
they got to all go off .
"so all the other routes were motorized and then those when we got a, a big batch of motor buses come in."
"it then erm, they would, they went out in one complete entity you see and the trolley wires were just taken down."
"erm, motor buses  very very expensive."
"another thing you might not realize is that erm, erm when you ordered motor buses you had to get authority from the ministry of transport and you used to apply for a bus grant."
"now in its infancy we used to get a fifty percent grant, that was the price of the bus was halved at, ministry would pay."
"it got phased out the ministry didn't pay anything but  to get this grant you had to keep tremendous records  copies of invoices and you had to get er and the bus grant and the, the permission from them."
"it was very difficult to get these things but erm, it did when you were talking about seventy two thousand pound for each bus."
you were glad to get half of it.
yes.
"cos trolley buses, in this town were  really the erm well i suppose they really came about, motor buses right at the start because  built trolley buses and so did  of laiston."
"you had er, in fact  used to use our overhead, to erm test their chassis before they went to the body makers."
if they were going to a different body maker anyway.
"so they,."
mm.
"we used to charge them for using our overhead  and erm, so i suppose trolley buses were used here because it was so convenient."
right on the doorstep making them.
yes  supply them.
"i, i, it's in this may be disjointed to want an  chronologically tell you everything that's happened but there are some of the highlights in my life."
"the sports section that you, you you harped on a little while ago."
"it was a thriving thing and, but when electric supply in nineteen forty eight went nationalized, we lost a lot of members and er, we did try to carry it on, just ipswich borough transport."
"i think the snooker section, the table section they're still flourishing actually but to football, you just hadn't got enough members."
"you, you can't have a transport football team because you can't get enough of us together at one time cos they're working you see, when people want to go to and from work  but er."
"so you, you came up for retirement what in nineteen."
well it's er i've.
"been retired five years now, that was eighty two, yes."
"i, i worked the end of may and accrued leave i er  i left then."
my actual retirement date was the twenty second of july.
"i had worked there, and that was when i was sixty five, so i'd worked there all my working life, the, the war years  and had served under quite a number of people really."
"when i first went there we had   who was a tall heavy built man and you well i did, i walked in fear of my life."
"if i could get him, not talk to him i was happy but if he spoke to me i was literally shake in me shoes, he gave you that, he was that erm type of man, although he was kind enough really, but he was really gruff."
"bowler hat, little moustache and spats and when you came through the shed, my god, nobody slacked cos  he had eyes everywhere  and the traffic superintendent was , he was directly responsible to him  erm then erm  retired and erm then  retired during the war and they had another fella come in from  he came from away."
he wasn't there all that time.
"i think he had a little bit of ill health and my immediate superior  took over as traffic superintendent and he was there throughout the war and when i came out he was my boss and er  you see and er and then in nineteen forty eight  was made transport manager, because as you say we had to split from electric supply and he carried on until erm nineteen seventy two and erm, we had government reorganization and erm  they did away with people like the town clerk and transport manager and erm erm  was retired, early retirement, the same as  the town clerk and erm they brought in a general manager from away and brought in more staff with him and that was  came in and er so i then applied for the position, which was going, there was, there was traffic superintendent was going er chief administration officer, chief engineer and erm er bodywork maintenance superintendent."
"all those positions were going for want of an application, so i applied and because  brought in people who he knew, certain of them were automatically filled but they want the chief administration officer, so i applied and really i don't kid myself that i got it my qualification because i hadn't got any letters after my name."
mm.
i think i got it my local knowledge and that gave him the facility of being able to carry on without interruption.
"if you'd had all people come in and try to bring in new ideas an old system, i don't think it would have worked."
"so they had me as continuity and i got the job and it was a bit of a struggle because i'd always been traffic, traffic at work but this was different in that if you had to do more accountancy and i had to pick it up."
i had a lot of help from people and erm well i'm fairly adaptable and i took over this job of chief administrator's assistant.
"sorry chief administrator officer and i had to provide quite a lot of statistical information which i'd never done before but nevertheless i, i made a fairly reasonable job of it, i had an assistant and erm  i, i think i got fairly well known amongst the councillors and people who mattered and then  went."
"he had some ill health erm he, he was, they brought in a bloke who was retired from some place up north, sheffield i think it was."
they brought him back as a caretaker to general manager and really i didn't see eye to eye with him.
"he came in with the ideas, give the drivers and conductors everything they asked for whereby my training had always been to only give them what they were really entitled to, not give them anything extra but he gave them the earth and that erm didn't go very well for the new manager  who came in, he had a lot of undoing to do there, that this fella had given away, in his six or seven weeks there."
"in fact, you know, he gave the drivers and conductors more than what they were really entitled to but."
what sort of things?
"well, he there in, in the various agreements there, there were scheduling anomalies which erm, if they  i can't recall the exact wording now but if they er, their average wage, working week was between forty two and forty four hours, they had to get make up pay and all that sort of thing."
"well we argued that erm, they weren't entitled to it."
"we read the, read the agreements differently to what they did but he'd lean towards the drivers, conductors and he gave away a lot of what  had tried to erm stop them from having because they weren't really entitled to it but he saw differently and gave it away and course once you've given it away you, no way of retracting it, but then  came in and, well, i mean he was a real transport man, his, his vision and his ideas were really good and he made it what it is today."
"he was really and, lovely man to work with."
"he was genuine, he appreciated everything you did and i don't think you get a better manager and he's now under this new transport act when transport, this was erm, was  nationalized isn't it?"
"he, that he's now a director of this ipswich buses and i don't think you can get a better man to do it because he is heart and soul in transport, he, the things that he brought in, the different innovations that he brought in were good, i mean he brought in, he brought in all this erm  operated vaults and all that sort of thing and all this electronic gear that they are working now."
mm.
"so you, you think you had er, er er you know go back, well looking back on it."
quite happy with the way it's all gone?
"oh yes, i had a good life."
"i, i think er erm when i first started down there, it was a job, i thought well this is a good job fifteen bob a week, that's, that's a lot more than some of the other boys who'd left school got, they were twelve and six you see and erm, i think erm i came back the forces and took over more responsible jobs, i don't think i could have gone to anything else but transport."
"you were with the public, direct contact with the public and er i would hate to have been sat in an office and just looked at four walls."
"i, i used to roam around the building."
"go and talk to the fitters, interest myself in what made buses work and how they worked when down in the pits."
"i, i couldn't bear to have sit in four walls and not  move."
yes.
from the desk.
"it, i think i had a good life there and i've got no regrets  i think to be public transport is, is a good thing."
anything to do with the public.
"oh yes, right."
"you get, you know the slings and arrows but they don't hurt you, you, you get a lot more people who appreciate what you do than slings and bats."
oh well.
thank you very much.
"well i, i don't whether that's of much interest to anybody."
"probably listening to it, it probably sound like a drill."
thank you very much indeed.
yes.
good morning.
"er, it's an insurance ."
.
updated for yesterday.
twelfth.
can you give us a prescription for these?
just some more of those?
"aye, sure."
that's that covered.
that.
twenty second.
twenty sixth i've got an interview.
are these helping?
aye.
good.
"aye,i think i've a wee touch of the flu."
you must be the only one.
is it back?
oh aye.
aye?
"oh, it's never been away."
"oh, i feel terrible this morning."
"never been away, it's been  the last month."
"oh i never caught it, right enough, but i feel i've caught it now."
well let's see if  we can get things quietened down for your life.
have it easy.
"in the past month in here, well, it's been like that every day."
"been like that every day, there's never been a, a quiet day."
"there we are charlie, that'll keep that right for you."
"okay, thanks."
"okay,."
right.
cheerio now.
cheerio.
really miss .
well i oh i'll tell you i've got er a a a girl.
a girl.
and she knew i didn't care for school.
that i wanted to come from school but they wouldn't all ow me to come from school because me father had signed for four years you see.
and this was two years.
and he owned a shop did he?
"mr  's mr , yes."
mhm.
i had a letter from the daughter yesterday.
from america.
and erm then she told me about this so my mother went to see him.
"and you know we arranged for that, but i had a bit of a job to come from school."
to leave after two years.
you know but we i i got out at any rate.
how how old were you then miss ?
fifteen and a half.
and then my erm my mother saw him and then i went to see him and then i started the last week in july with him after the school closed.
"and then i was with him for five years till nineteen the same week, nineteen thirty, i took over the business from him in valley."
but i was in holyhead.
he had a shop in holyhead and in valley.
why did you want to leave school?
i dunno.
i wanted to go work.
you know.
"wasn't interested in well i mean interest i suppose but i think what it was to start with i i missed the first term, you know after passing for the county, i missed the first term."
we had diphtheria see.
i had it first.
and we must have caught it from there.
because er my mother was fair and she must have carried it or something and then i i'd just started i think a week of two or three weeks and my sister got it and the boys never got it.
"so i suppose if you don't get the first term in in county school, they don't bother with you."
you you miss the counting don't you because it was different to a school like in the valley school.
and then er i suppose the interest well i did well there two year really.
i mean  i saw a  came and i started with him and i liked it.
and i kept to it.
"and then they were giving up and going to america, they were going they had a sister."
mrs  had a sister and er a brother.
and his sister was in texas and the brother was in philadelphia.
"so they were joining them, they came over the texas sister came over for twelve months and they must have persuaded them to go back or something."
so they went.
"so i didn't know anything about it you know, till somebody asked me well asked me really, mr  's going away isn't he?"
"i said, no i don't think so, i said, i haven't heard."
"oh he is, he's going to america, they said to me, you see, somebody, one of the customers i suppose."
"ooh, i said, i haven't heard."
so next morning i approached him.
"i said,, i said, i heard last night, i said, that you're going to america, is it true."
"oh yes, he said, like that."
but we weren't going to tell you anything jut yet.
we had something else in mind for you.
so that's it.
i knew then they were going.
"so when they did say they were definitely going, he said, what he  you see, he wanted me to take the valley shop over."
"and he came to see my father, and my father thought i was young."
how how old.
"fifteen and a half er well no i was nineteen and a half then you see, five years isn't it."
and he thought i was young.
well i hadn't got a chance to .
"so er mr , he told my father, oh no, she'll be able to do it ."
"she's sure to get on, mr , he said like that."
i remember him saying this.
"he said, you're she's sure to get on."
"so my father didn't know what to do, because he'd only just started on his own, so he was tight for money wasn't he."
"and in the old days, they didn't have money like they have now."
and you couldn't get any money in the old days.
no.
no the same as you can now.
well they get money now and somebody else had got  these days.
"so erm still so he said to me, what'll do?"
"well, i said, i'll give it a chance, i said, and if it doesn't pay, cos he was better off than i was because he had the two shops."
"if he couldn't get rid of fruit here, he could get it in rid of it in holyhead because the country place weren't so fond of fruit in them days as the english people you know."
welsh people didn't eat fruit like the the english you know.
no?
no.
not the same.
and they have gardens and then they have apple trees and things like that.
"well, i said, i'll give it a chance."
well so i went and then they came on the friday night it must have been the twenty twenty fifth of july nineteen thirty.
they came the friday night to go for the midnight mail you know the one that comes to meet the boat.
or the boat meet meets the boat.
"so they came with the keys for me, the shop keys, and to say goodbye to us."
"and then i opened up on saturday morning, first thing and there i was standing in the shop."
this is all mine now.
and it's funny how you get used to a thing.
you're afraid of doing this and afraid of going into this and afraid of going into that thinking it's not yours.
isn't it?
but i soon got into it.
so that's the way it started for me.
"so i carried on and carried on and , the travellers i knew most of the travellers i knew."
a lot of them i some i was told not to bother with.
by him.
i knew myself.
i had a lot of trouble with them in holyhead.
you know.
yes.
"yeah, some of them."
some of the wholesalers you know.
especially the fruiterers.
short weight and things like that .
mm.
so he told me to keep clear of them.
just to go to so and so.
so that's what i did.
"then i found my way, you know, you you learn as you go along really don't you, a lot."
"and i carried on, carried on."
oh we used to do very well there.
really.
and we used to have a very good erm fruit and confectionery business.
"and cigarettes you know, that sort of thing."
used to do well with cigarettes.
"and the firms used to call themselves you know, the i used to but direct, not from the wholesaler."
er cigarettes and things like that.
"was that er,."
"wills, players,and er craven a isn't it."
and erm what were the others?
er benson and hedges isn't it.
we used to deal direct from all those.
so it was worth it for the for the when the war came.
it was worth it because you had a good erm quota from them.
during they were we were put on quotas with everything.
"and when i first went to the business, they didn't have fruit like they have now, everyday you know."
and round the year.
oranges only came in in october for christmas.
october?
yeah.
er they started coming in the christmas oranges.
you wouldn't see perhaps and orange during the summer.
"but now you can get them from different places, but then they were spanish."
spanish oranges.
and the jaffa oranges and things like that.
and we used to get a lot of californian fruit.
apples and things like that.
", oregons and another ."
and a lovely jonathan they had too.
californian fruit is lovely fruit you know.
is it?
mm.
beautiful.
nicer than any really.
"but we don't get that now, they get south african's now don't they and they get italians and french and there's all sorts of things but they're not as nice as the californian fruit."
"so that's they way i started and then , when the war came in nineteen thirty nine isn't it?"
well we used to er get jersey potatoes and things like that and then new potatoes.
"everything like that, vegetables and everything like that."
and when the war came you see we were rationed for nearly everything.
"so the more you bought, during the time you were in business, the more quota you got you see, what you'd been buying."
and some you used to have points to get sweets and things like that.
and i carried a very very big stock of sweets because there was such a variety.
"and everybody, you had to keep to suit every customer if you wanted to make a business."
you had to do that.
"or do without isn't it you know, you had to stock for the sake of getting the business."
"then between that and i was never short of sweets, during the war."
i er kept going.
and they were on points.
"and i remember being called to caernarfon once, during the time, asking me why did i have such a lot of surplus of points."
"you see, , some people didn't take use them all, they say, oh you might keep them."
"then other people couldn't get enough again you see, so if they were giving you er points well naturally you had the sweets to give them, you're not diddling anybody or anything like that."
you were having points for them.
and er i was called there so i told them.
"i said, we is a family, i said, we're a big family, i said, we don't eat sweets, i said, well we've got those i said, it's no use throwing them, we just put them in."
and it nothing happened.
"you know, but they were very keen on er with the points."
and then rations.
"and that's how i started to go into grocery, because you couldn't get fruit."
"and during the war years, like perhaps we were allocated what we were."
if we were a fruiterer. we had more more quote like er what did they call them?
points was it?
or quota at any rate you know.
no units they called them.
"units, two units, four units or six units whatever your trade and where you were."
"well they's allocated me as a grocer you see and the fruiterer i dealt with the, the wholesaler, the i dealt most of with in was he said to me, you're not getting enough for what you are, he said to me."
"well no, i said, i don't know why."
"well they've allocated you as a grocer, he said, but you're not a grocer."
"only i just turned into grocery because you couldn't get fruit, when you want well you had a bit but not much."
you couldn't keep going without  something isn't it so.
"they had a committee somewhere, i think in caernarfon i think they had their committee."
and he brought this up about the units i had and he he rang me up on the friday night isn't it?
this was for tomatoes i think the quota of tomatoes.
i couldn't understand them neither really.
"because, they could afford to give me my back back ration and yet, they said they were short of things."
well at any rate he gave me a ring about erm sometime about four o'clock i think.
"he said they've changed your units, and he said there's an allocation a back allocation for you of forty baskets of tomatoes he said to me."
"i don't know if you want them, he said to me like that you see."
"well, i said, i'll have them, i'll chance them, i said like that to him."
"i'll have them, i said like that."
"well, he said, i'm putting them on the train and they'll be in valley on the seven o'clock train for you on friday night this was."
"right, i said like that."
"so the porter in the valley station here came, brought them on the hand cart he had."
not the lorry.
and he brought me these forty baskets of tomatoes this friday night.
"right, i said, i'll clear the window, i said, i'll put them all in the window."
"because they were perishable goods, it was no use keeping them you see."
and there was twelve pounds in each basket.
clear them all except six baskets on saturday.
good heavens.
yeah.
"but mind you i used to give them six, whatever they wanted you know."
and there was market in holyhead and people passing and things like that in it.
"and i cleared the lot except six baskets and they were all in good condition, so i was glad of these six baskets really because it helped you to give them one or two more."
"because you'd only get half a pound perhaps and perhaps you'd only get perhaps, this unit'd only get two, what came into the country, or what was on the market."
"and then perhaps the next erm lot that came, perhaps you'd get six to a unit, so you had twelve baskets, that's the way they used to work them."
i see.
and the same with oranges.
i remember getting one lot of oranges though that half of them were bad.
so we had a lot of waste on them.
and then the boats were sunk during the war.
"and then every boat that came in, it depended how many cases of oranges or whatever it was apples or whatever it."
"but i remember one time one week, i had fifty cases of oranges in."
"big ones, you know, three three sectioned er boxes."
"not er like they bring them in these cardboard boxes you know, wooden boxes."
"remember they used to used they used to get these, the farmers used to ask for these boxes because they made er hen's nests, you know that type you know where they oh they were good boxes."
but i think fruit was better in them than in these cardboard boxes too.
but er i i had fifty of them.
"well i'd no room in this shop, there was no erm anywhere to store them expect the man just here see, where the where they used to keep his car."
just there.
oh yes.
mm.
for the storage.
"so i said, my brother was in the army then and my father was there on his own, so i asked him, i said, can we put them in the workshop?"
i said like that.
"and he said, yes, he said like that."
so they brought them down here and they had fifty cases of oranges in here.
"in the not this one, the old workshop."
and i used to take them as i wanted them and i cleared the lot.
"i didn't get any waste, they were in lovely condition."
but mind you they went quicker then because they were hard to get.
"you know, people and i didn't, well you were well we did mark the book at perhaps a a pound to a book you know, like they were in those days."
"but with them coming like that and perishable goods, we let them go as they wanted them, to clear the lot like that."
"and perhaps we wouldn't see an orange for a fortnight, three weeks perhaps."
perhaps a month.
we wouldn't get one.
and the same with all fruit er they were rationed like that.
but we managed.
and then the grocery built up and built up like everybody.
but they used to ask me for things but i thought there were enough erm shops here really.
because this corner shop was here.
then the co-op was where i was this one.
"and then further on there was a little shop like this one, they were grocers."
"then over the line again there was another shop where mr a p jones do you know, the retired schoolmaster that used to be in valley, he lives now."
there was a shop there.
and was there a shop no i don't think there was a shop anywhere on this road?
and then i thought to myself.
"they were on oh and there was the er where the midland bank is, there was a cafe there and they sold odd things you know."
there was enough there and people used to tell me used to ask for things.
"well, i said, there's plenty of shops here selling that."
"i said, i'll well they sell fruit and they sell this and they well, i said, the i i that's my trade i said, the fruit and the sweets like you know more."
but oh i don't  and then the war came didn't it.
"so that changed me and after that it went from you know, higher and higher all the time, the more and we used to get ."
we have used to quite quite a lot of the  coming round here.
and that way.
oh we used to get a lot of them.
"and er when i first came to the shop, the a lot of them used to come by train and you know taxis or meeting and at the station and and holyhead they used to stop by the shop for fruit."
"and i don't know what it was but they all seemed to say the same, the visitors, they all used to say, you've got lovely fruit here."
"well, i said, it's only the same as everywhere else."
but yours is much nicer.
"but i think the building you see, was a warmer place in the summer."
ah.
you see.
corrugated and wood.
yeah.
draws the heat doesn't it?
yes.
and i think it ripened the fruit better than if it was in a cool shop.
i used to but mine under-ripe you know.
all my fruit.
did you?
yeah.
that.
but it's obvious that you've always gone in for quite stylish displays of your fruit too haven't you?
"oh yes, yes i we always used to do that."
"we had baskets, special baskets for it."
"and i kept it the same and that's when we bought this in nineteen fifty four, there was a lot of alterations to be done."
to suit me you yes.
to suit me.
"because, you remember that er picture you saw with the fruit in?"
behind the counter?
"yes, well in well i've got some photos of this to be inside somewhere."
i'll try and find them sometime for you to see  sometime.
"but this used to be a bicycle shop, the first world war."
this this one.
the the corrugated iron one ?
yes that's what  that's why it's got a window like that you see.
i see.
and then it's the window's high from the floor.
and i had to get a box and many a time i've fallen on my back from that so cos somebody had moved  the boxes i think .
i've had a lot of falls in my time.
.
and then that was erm a cobbler's place.
that's next door ?
"yes, just a little place and that's where mr  started in that one and then he moved into there when that went empty."
yeah.
that's how he started there.
and the bungalow's next door isn't it.
the that came after.
and er i dunno it went from that and and i'm sorry i i had to leave it really.
. i enjoyed it.
i feel sometimes i could go back.
"you know, but things are different they say, now."
why did you er did you leave the business in the end?
"well my mother see, i came home to my mother."
"because my brother was here, and he couldn't go out with mother being here old."
you see my mother was eighty nine when she died.
and then she couldn't cope with going out to the people there.
and i was the only one that was single.
"and er really i'd  well i mean, i had my pleasure in the shop."
it was a pleasure to i liked it.
"but i couldn't let my mother be here, and then it was more for my brother because he had a wife and he it was more for him to be working than er for me really, cos i come to pension age then you see."
when i was leaving for my mother.
i was sixty one you see when i left the shop.
and then after that but er many a time i wish i was back you know.
but my mother came first isn't it and it was easier for me.
to come home than for anybody else.
"so that's why i came home, not that i wanted to come you know, to give it up."
and then we and my brother wouldn't carry it on.
i had my brother with me and his niece and they wouldn't carry on.
no?
no.
"he wasn't keep on being inside you see, it's alright going out."
with a van.
. so he wasn't keen on being inside so he wouldn't carry on.
well he had a job to go to in the council too really.
because he was looking after the council offices.
"and then he had a job, they had a job for him you know, and i he didn't want to leave me, well i said, you can go, i said, it's alright if i'm going to sell, i said, that would be alright."
and but he didn't leave until after i'd sold you know.
what er encouraged you to move from your first shop to valley stores?
"well because i hadn't got the place to keep things, that's why."
"it wasn't suitable for bacon, butter, cos it a hot place you see, and there was no room for putting any fridges or well i did  have an ice-cream fridge there."
"eventually, like, when we had electricity."
we didn't get that then till nineteen fifty.
didn't you?
we had lamps you know.
erm aladdin lamps we had erm lighting up the place.
hanging from the roof ?
yes.
"from the roof, yeah."
so there wasn't er the space for storage really.
and er the co-op went.
closed.
"and it was up for sale so i don't know who said, are you going to try?"
"ooh i don't know, i said, like that because i was in a in a good spot there you know, it was a very good spot."
"i was there if i'd have been there to july, that year that i moved there, i would have been there twenty five years, on that road."
"but it went, you see with the traffic and things like that i'd perhaps it wouldn't have been quite so handy for me because i'd no parking room there because there was a big back to there."
you know parking space.
"and er so mr  was where mr  is now, then."
"so we asked him if he'd come to the sale and i told my father, cos my father wasn't keen you know."
er i told him i was going to try for the co-op.
"well you're very silly, he said to me, trying."
"well i said, i'm going, i said, i'm going to give it a try."
"i said, but i won't pay more than i can afford to pay for it."
"so we went, it was on a friday afternoon i think, in june."
i don't remember the date.
"and er we went in, there were quite a crowd there you know."
"and er there was four i think, there was a a mr  from holyhead, and there was a mr  he he lived in bangor but he was running the ironmongers that was by the station in the old days."
"there was an ironmongers shop by the station, in the."
yeah.
and he was from bangor.
erm what was the name of the place in bangor.
he was there.
and i can't remember who the other was that was there.
there was four of us and we started bidding and somebody in the crowd started bidding four thousand.
everybody went everybody went like   there nobody saying a thing.
mhm.
"so i i was not bidding myself, mr  went to the auctioneer, mr , he's dead."
mr  now .
and er he went to him so he went to speak to this woman about the thing and she was member of the co-op see.
"and i suppose she had money there, must have been ."
it was a sort of like a i don't know what whether it was erm some sort of a private or it belonged to this manchester co-op or something i think it was.
there were memberships i suppose that would keep it.
"oh at any rate, he they started rebidding and then it went and went and it fell and then this mr  gave up and whoever the other one was, don't remember who he was."
"and er somebody asked him why he'd stopped bidding, well, he said, i could see there was nobody in my line trying for it."
when he saw who was trying you see.
and then this mr  he had a grocery shop in holyhead.
but he wanted the living place more than he wanted the shop.
"i knew this mr , william ."
he was friendly with my erm uncle they'd both been in  starting when they started in business.
"so he stopped and then it fell, and it fell short of the hundred pound they wanted."
they had a reserve price on it.
so we paid that because they wanted and then we had to pay for stock.
there wasn't much stock there though.
"all rubbish, we had to throw it ."
but i paid about four hundred for it oh but you had to if you wanted it.
so er that's the way i er had it and and somebody else asked mr  why did he stop bidding?
"oh, he said, if we had carried on it would have been dear for somebody."
but it fell for one one thousand five hundred then in nineteen fifty four.
"so it wasn't a bad price really, but i was able to pay for it."
that was the main thing.
"you know, i didn't want to ."
"the auctioneer came to me, oh i suppose you'll want to borrow some money now."
"i said, no thank you."
"i said, everything's all arranged."
was that er would that have been considered unusual to have had the money to pay that amount in those days?
"no i don't think so, no ."
mm.
well er it would in a way because you'd have to pay interest on what you were borrowing wouldn't you?
yes.
oh yes you have to pay now a mortgage won't you.
you have to pay interest on what you you borrow now.
so it was better for me if i was able to pay.
"i was free then, i could do you know."
and then i came home after the sale.
i told my father.
"i teased him for a bit that i didn't get it, it went for so much."
"and he said to me, er, and then i said, no, i said, we've been lucky."
i said about it.
mm.
and i told him all about it.
he was glad in the end too.
there was nobody more glad than him really but i suppose he thought i'd go into debt or something but i wouldn't do that.
i'd rather be without.
"oh and the er er one of the co-op members, he was a big noise there i think, i don't know if he was the chairman of the committee or what."
"but he he met me on the road one day and he said to me, miss , it would pay you to give a decent price for it, he said to me."
oh why?
i said.
well to keep somebody else from coming out.
"i said, it makes no difference to me, i said."
i'll only bid as far as i can pay mr .
his name was mr .
mr  i said like that.
"and if it goes more than that, i said, it can go, i said."
it makes no difference to me.
"i said, it's you to make your business."
you don't want to keep anybody else  er er space for everybody if they want to try.
"it's er you, i said, you've to make your business."
"and er i don't know what he said after, i don't know."
mhm.
but i think oh he was all nice and everything er you know.
"but you see, the more money they had, the more they had to share i suppose with."
yeah.
i don't know.
to my way of thinking like that isn't it.
i suppose they was.
"he owned the place you know, the it was a good place."
so we were lucky and then we opened up on january the fourth nineteen fifty five.
on the the day of my birthday.
yes.
mm.
when i was forty five.
getting old.
why worry isn't it.
it's just how you feel.
"and er with that one, i owned the ground."
in the old place but i didn't own the shop.
"so nobody could i kept that shop, i paid the rent on the shop for twelve months, i kept it closed for twelve months, to get that place going."
you know to get the people used to coming.
"not that it would have made any difference because i mean, people used to go into shops on that side, which never came up our way and the same with us, coming up there and not going that way isn't it."
so we managed and we opened up  see how quick they came.
they soon got into it though.
did they?
oh yes.
well i suppose they'd have been used to going there before you see.
"and near the post office, opposite the post office, so they were but the only thing i didn't like there was the houses opposite me   they all seemed to be in their windows watching everything ."
"that's the only thing because n the other place you see, it's quite open."
oh you can't see it can you.
"across the road you see, er there was a road er opposite."
that it was very nice there too on the main road.
but we soon got used to the place.
you had your work and then you just don't didn't bother.
but er you could see them    you know.
we were from the road and then you see higher.
"and then , we carried on from there and we just i was going to do a lot of things you know."
but i never got to do them.
"if ever i'd lost my mother, , we were lucky we had our father and mother."
you know  you know some people they lose them young don't they.
when they're young and they've got the chance.
but we had our father and mother for years.
actually for that.
er and then er i was going to make a nice flat and i was going to build a warehouse and things to  but i didn't got to do it .
i came home.
and had to settle home.
don't know if there's anything else you want to know.
"you would have liked to have extended the business more then, would you?"
"oh well yes, i'd carry on oh mind you, we stocked everything then."
we had everything.
"o=only the the only thing was that you hadn't got enough room to display everything that you could stock, isn't it."
you know what i mean.
they had to ask if they wanted.
"but it didn't matter what they asked for they had, we had it."
"because they used to say, oh go to so and so's you're sure to get it."
you know and word goes round.
i never advertised you know.
never advertised.
my own advertising was giving them the the service and the quality.
and the attention.
"but i erm advertised in papers, anything like that."
"so if someone wanted something specially,."
yeah?
you would order it for them ?
yes yes.
"if they wanted and during the summer months, we had the same people coming every year."
since some of them came when i was with mr .
and they kept coming and coming to me just the same.
"and when i was there and they used to send their orders they used to come holiday times, some people had houses in  and ."
"they used to send me their orders perhaps three weeks before they were coming, either for us to deliver or for us to erm have them ready for them to collect on their way up."
some used to stay in farms and things like that.
and they used to send orders isn't it it was nothing to see fifty items on an order.
"isn't it, different things."
and we were always able to supply them.
yeah.
"and they used to say, some of them used to say er, if there's anything you can't get, if you you can't get for us or haven't got, er just let us know and we'll bring it with us."
but they didn't have to.
we always had them.
and er my father used to do the garden then.
"we used to have a lot of lettuce and summer summertime, we didn't see so many because everybody had a garden here and everybody er you know, grew lettuce."
"and i remember one year, we'd had some webbs curly lettuce and i was we had a good crop and i remember one lady who stayed in  and she come used to come well practically every other days for six of these."
and they were like cabbage.
"oh they were lovely too, that year."
they were nice.
and we hadn't got any more of those nice lettuce you know.
"crisp nice and crisp they were, lovely lettuce."
and er we used to try and  them in the garden just to get the odd one or two for somebody you know.
oh yes we had a we had a lovely time.
they were nice though.
nice people.
we had very good customers really.
they were.
"and a lot of them have gone now you know, passed away."
a lot of the old ones.
and we used to have one gentleman come in from the country.
and he's he's dead now though.
and he used to come regular every friday.
when this was with mr .
and i was there.
and he wouldn't allow anybody else anybody to serve him except mrs .
i couldn't serve him.
cos i was only young yet.
he obviously though i didn't know what to .
"well and he used to come regular every friday afternoon, and he used to go the a lower down you know, after you pass the police station on the left there, there used to be a butcher's place there."
lovely lovely meat they had too.
"and er he used to go there for meat but he used to buy two lots, one for his his own place and one for the farm he had you see."
for the one that was in the farm.
he used to buy two lots of things.
"so if he three apples of apples, he'd have two lots like that."
"and this friday, one friday, mrs  said to me  said, if mr  comes, tell him i'm not here."
she said to me.
i knew i was telling a lie.
i'm sure he could see on my face.
i'll stay in the back she said.
so she stayed in the back.
"so mr  came in, he said, is mrs  in?"
"i'm sorry i said, she hasn't come."
expecting her any minute.
"and then , he allowed me to serve him  then ."
"and then after that, he never asked  for her ."
no?
no.
i suppose he thought i didn't know the different you see.
"but that's one thing i did, i used to tell the girls i said, give them decent things, i said like that."
"if you want them to come back, i said."
i'd rather take the loss myself than for people to get you know rotten stuff.
or to bring anything back.
but some don't bother do they?
"you know i get things now, i just have to throw them some of them."
"but er at any rate, we managed and he never asked after that."
whoever was there served him then.
it's funny how you get into a lot of people are like that.
in business till they get to know and things like that.
some nice customers too.
"but the only thing was, sometimes you know, the the visitors  in the mornings they used to come out, the visitors."
during the summer.
"some people, oh these  visitors and people used to say to me, well now look, i said like that, visitors, i said like that, there's enough stuff for everybody."
"we cater for them, i said, we buy extra."
"for visitors and they want things that the locals don't want, i said."
they buy things that the local people don't want.
"and i said, another thing, i said, some visitors i get here, i said, they buy more from me in a month than some of the locals buy in a week."
more er and more in a month some of them than the others did in a year.
and those were the ones that grumbled.
it's extra isn't it you see when you think of it.
"you buy, you're not doing the locals they they weren't going short of anything."
"and if you had your regulars and things were in short supply, you wouldn't put those on the shelves, you'd keep them back for when they came in."
mm.
you know.
mm.
that's the way i used to do it at any rate.
"well what sort of proportion would you say, of your trade was purely visitors?"
well  what i used to always say it was pretty steady all the year round.
mm.
on the average.
you do get extra because you get passers by in summer don't.
mm.
"you know, stop for things."
"you see, the locals have their own things in the garden in summer."
"their potatoes and their vegetables and well fruits and apples, plums things like that isn't it."
if they want.
and then they used to keep you in the winter more or less and the visitors making up so it was a steady trade all round.
i used to think mine was pretty steady all the year round.
"if you missed your certain things, you were gaining by the visitors."
stuff that they wanted you know like the erm sugar and the tea and things like that.
"but other things, they had in the garden like vegetables and like gooseberries, things like you know, the fruit."
. i i mine was pretty steady.
i you know.
"you do make extra, holiday time."
"like you you have easter eggs don't you, and you have christmas goods."
we used to run a christmas club .
"and then i used to bank i used to post put that in the post office in a separate account, i didn't use it you see."
i used to keep that separate see till christmas time.
i never used it in the like people put it in the till.
i never did that.
no?
no i kept it on its own.
because it wasn't mine till they had had the stuff.
you know at christmas and then i i managed to save a bit in the post office with that.
for my old age.
you do  just do these things.
you've got to work for yourself really haven't you.
"you can't expect people to tell you this, tell you that."
you've got to what you think.
is that is that one of the reasons that you went into business in the first place?
to be independent?
well i don't know.
er you know when we were children wasn't it.
"people used to ask they do with their children no don't they, what are you going to do when you grow up."
"i said, shop owners."
"well you couldn't go nursing till you were about eighteen or nineteen or something, if not more."
in those days.
isn't it.
"my sister again, she was asked."
"oh she was going to be a , that's what she said."
well she was .
well she went nursing again.
quite the opposite to what she was going to go.
but she stayed in school four years you know.
she did.
did she?
yeah.
"but er she went nursing, and she's still nursing."
she does two days in  nursing home in bangor.
and er she oh i was going to go well i like the shop so much i wasn't going to change.
i liked it.
and meeting people and that's what i like too.
i liked serving people.
did you?
yeah.
i used to i used to love being by the counter.
not that i'm one for erm like talking like some people do and wanting this and er you know.
but i liked serving and i liked to feel that i was able to have sold somebody something.
and not to go out empty handed.
"it was you know, i did like that."
i enjoyed serving better than anything.
"i i had to do the other jobs as i know, but i used to like serving people because i used to like meeting people and sort of study people."
you know their characters and things like that.
and knowing how to please them.
that's what i one thing i liked.
was able to please a customer.
"which touchwood, i think i managed."
i don't think i turned anybody away i don't think.
what do you what would be the important ways that you would think you used in order to please them?
"oh well i suppose, put all your attention to their needs isn't it."
"you see, you go into some shops, you i'm serving you."
you'll see them talking to somebody else somewhere else and you're serving this person.
"well that's wrong, to me."
"if you're er serving this lady or gentleman whoever it is, you should put your whole mind with this person, not er wait for them to ask what they want, and talk with somebody else like that, and that's done in a lot of these shops."
well they  used to but it's self service isn't it and that's another thing.
i couldn't join.
no no erm spar no what was it?
mace?
nothing like that.
"i didn't join any of them, i kept independent the whole time i was there."
because after all they were having the cream of the shop people and some of them found out that the hard way.
and i said  oh it's so and so that gets all the profit.
"i know, i said, i haven't joined them, because er they they tell you what to sell everything."
"well you see now, say tea say it was a shilling."
"well perhaps if you bought it direct yourself, you'd perhaps get fourpence on it."
i'm not saying it was fourpence but perhaps you'd get fourpence.
"well if you bought it through that mace, they tell you to sell and you'd only get  on it."
so i didn't join any of them i kept independent while i could at any rate and then .
so you maintained a direct link between you and the manufacturer or or the distributor .
yes more of them yes.
we had a wholesalers we had to get wholesalers for some things.
"more or less, but i used to buy my bacon from  's."
i used to get that direct from them.
and then i used to get from  we used to get our sausage and things like that.
"pies and then frozen stuff, bird's eye,we used to deal with."
"came there weren't many then when i was there, there's more now frozen stuff."
and then er cadburys all them.
the main all the biscuit firms we used to deal with.
and how many biscuit firms came and we still bought from every one of them.
but they've all got their good lines you see.
"see jacobs were noted for their crackers, more than anybody else's."
so between them all we were able to buy the best sellers from you know.
christmas cakes.
"i was looking the other day, when i was looking for some of these things."
the price of christmas cakes in the old days.
"twelve and six, the cheapest, the smallest."
"honestly, now it's price they are now."
mm.
and they were nicer then than now.
they were lovely.
wasn't there a an enormous amount of erm work involved?
in ordering all this stuff?
well i don't know.
it never worried me.
i knew what i had and i knew what i wanted.
"and it's funny things some of these travellers oh you get some awful travellers you know, southern  some of them."
they're pushing stuff to you.
"and er they used to say, don't you want to go and see what you've got?"
"i said, no, i said, i know what i've got."
i know what i want.
"they'd go, i've never seen anybody like you."
they always seemed to want to go and look or what they haven't but i never used to do that.
"i was ready if a traveller came in, i'd be ready for him."
i knew what i had.
see if i was fetching anything or anything like that oh we had an we we had a big stock er big stock you know.
"but we used to turn it over, not like they push it in front, new stuff old, we never had that, we never did that."
we always used to have the old ones out.
"and before easter, after christmas, i used to start buying extra of  things that kept."
ready for the season i wouldn't have to buy a lot of things when you were busy.
i'd have them in stock ready.
and that's what we used to do.
"and er then there was a traveller used to say, oh you're not afraid of buying."
"well i said, if i don't buy, i don't get a chance of selling."
you know.
"and sometimes you used to  things had gone up, you were lucky in that way."
"other times, perhaps things had come down, but not so much then."
"if things were dear, not by so much."
"but if they were cheap, that's the time to buy."
you you learn these things as you go along.
but we had some there were some good travellers then though.
in in the old the old travellers.
they were good.
used to deal with erm  er fruits well they were er i suppose.
liverpool he used to come.
"as i was saying we didn't get we were buying in october ready for christmas, buying them in."
"and this mr  he was, he used to he well he was calling with mr  and he kept calling with me the same so i used to order my bulk in october to come in for christmas goods."
and he used to come regular.
he used to come in october and he used to drop off the ten o'clock train here.
he came by train.
and then he used to have the bus on from here to holyhead to see the other people in holyhead.
yeah.
and we.
did he?
mm.
and you know  i don't know if they're still in caernarfon are they?
daniel and son are they?
no i don't think so?
no have they gone.
well they used to call too.
"they used to come round with cheap stuff, getting rid of their rubbish."
"i remember them coming through the shop once, want any cheap bananas?"
"yeah, what sort of bananas?"
and they were noted weren't they  for rubbish.
what are they like?
"oh so and so, oh they."
have i done anything?
no.
er i said.
carry on.
"i said, oh, i said, yes what are they like."
"and he'd say, oh they're like this."
"so like alright, bring them in to see, i said like that."
you know he knew  i didn't want them.
and then he guessed i didn't want to start with them.
erm he brought them in.
"nice ones er one or two nice ones on top you see,rubbish underneath."
"oh, i said, i don't want things like that, i said, take them away."
and they didn't oh i didn't used to bother with them.
no?
no.
they were rubbish the bananas .
they were coming from bangor with these things to sell.
i didn't get rid of them.
i suppose they always stock  you see a lot.
mm.
"you said that erm you enjoyed er meeting people and talking to them ,."
yes.
did did do you think you you were able to  form a judgement of people on the basis of your experience?
oh yes.
yes i think so.
yes.
mm.
you could see through them you know.
"oh yes, you got to know that's one thing in business that's one thing you have to do."
i think so at any rate.
that you have to find your way with people.
"what sort of people they are, some like a lot of chatting, other people don't."
and you've got to know their ways to be able to serve them properly.
i think.
"study them, not to go and rush and push things to them."
you've got oh i'm breaking everything now.
no.
it's alright.
erm you've got to go gently you know.
around.
"and then when you got to know your customers and when you know what they like and what they want, it's so much easier to serve."
once you get to know the customer.
"if you came in now and asked me for a pound of apples, well in a way i wouldn't know a stranger whether they like them under-ripe, ripe or just ready for eating."
"well if you're accustomed to serving and studying what they like cos some will ask you, oh i'd like some ripe ones."
well you'd naturally  one or two just to see if they're in what they want.
"well after that, if they asked for a pound of apples, you could get them the pound of apples and you'd sell quicker."
and you would remember that would you?
"yes, oh yes, that's one thing i've got i can remember."
"and during the war you see, we had queues for these things, when they were on ration."
"and  one gentleman in the crowd, he said, are we allowed to shift them?"
"well i said, i've got to, i said, i can't i haven't got time to talk to anybody, i said, i've got to shift it."
"you see, you were a lot on your own then, you couldn't get any help."
you see if the girls were sent to  taking them to other work.
"so if i had a queue isn't it, i just used to carry on with whatever was going on."
"and they were outside you know, standing."
were they?
yes.
there wasn't enough room in the shop.
"but i used to shift them and they used to say to me, you know how to shift them."
"but i don't think people, some people like you to chat with them for a long time, other people they just like you to serve the, so they can go."
don't like to wait about.
you know.
"and er we used to if we were busy, we used to tell they girls, i say, look, i said, you can talk any anytime you like."
"i said, like that, but if there's a shop full of people, i said, just serve, carry on and finish and then if you want to chat after."
"and i said, if somebody's serving somebody in the shop and perhaps they you know two of three of them perhaps  together, i said, but don't talk in the shop i said, go through to the back if you want to chat."
"because some people are very very very touchy, they'd think you were talking about them."
and somebody might laugh or something with something.
"one of the girls saying a something you know, and they laugh."
"i said, don't , i said like that."
i always says it.
"you've to sit a lot in the shop, go to the back if you want to chat."
unless there's somebody else wanting serving isn't it.
"if you happen to be serving, but i used to serve quite a lot myself."
but i think they make idle because  they knew what  they knew what i you know i was able to serve the  what they wanted isn't it.
oh.
it was lovely though.
was there anyone who came to work for you.
oh yes.
yes.
"who was who you were able to erm if you like, if you were who you were able to teach and show this sort of enthusiasm."
"yes they were all there you know, everyone of them you did."
they only had to be with you.
sometimes they'd stand with you while you were doing.
yeah.
yeah.
but they're you've got to have an interest i think to a lot.
but i had some very good girls though.
"they were very very good, very nice, all i had."
they were all country girls you know.
no town girls.
no?
no.
country girls are much better workers.
are they?
oh yes.
is that.
yes yes.
that's the difference is it?
well for me it was.
mm.
the others were more for dressing and er you know.
"but er country girls they set to it and work, they're good workers."
"i had very good girls really, i would just just erm lost one of the ones that used to work for me."
"she died, last month is it."
yes i think.
she died of leukaemia.
she was only forty three.
mhm.
yes she was a nice girl too.
"very nice, nice clean girl you know."
very good.
my niece used to work for me too.
there were six of us when i left.
in the shop?
mm.
then my brother.
"and i had a a part timer, a friend, and my niece and i had there were six of us altogether, there was another like two isn't it that's four."
yeah and my sister in law used to come my brother's wife used to come and help us with the cleaning at night.
but we used to clean the shop ready for the morning.
always ready to open.
"floors done and everything, we didn't have to do jobs as like that in the morning."
no?
no.
i used to do a lot of the cleaning myself.
at night and er if there was anything wanted filling up.
and i used to see to the fruits.
i used to fill that .
"yeah we were yeah we was we was like a happy family really, you know, everybody  through and through."
and that's a mistake a lot of shop people do.
they look down on their staff.
i think.
they just want to show who's boss.
but it doesn't work.
not for me.
no?
"i'd rather be one of them, work with them."
just put yourself one of them.
it's so much nicer i think.
"i was treated like that by mr and mrs , they treated me like their own daughter."
"and i said to myself, i've been under a boss."
right mrs  do have a seat.
what can i do for you?
it's the eczema again.
oh.
actually it started getting better from when i telephoned.
ah good.
what are you taking at the moment?
are we putting anything much on?
erm i use the dipabase and the erm.
betnovates.
betnovates.
ointment i think.
mm.
it was back in february i saw you isn't it?
let's have a look.
"and it really is very localized but that is quite angry, it's bubbly too and spreading, little finger."
but these two are fine.
mm.
mm.
hmm.
this  bubbly area.
you say that's .
mm.
yeah.
right are you still using betnovates and.
mm.
dipabase and.
yeah.
it's flared up despite that?
yeah.
"right,."
okey-doke.
hmm.
"it's, it's cracked ."
it makes it very.
"as i say it's better than, it's better than it was."
but it's still not that.
no.
good is it?
no.
no.
"right, what we need to do is to hit it fairly hard and try to get it damped down as quickly as we possibly can."
now don't get rid of the betnovate have you still got some left?
mm.
okay.
because it starts to die down you could probably go back betnovate to keep it maintained.
and you may actually have to use betnovate on a preventative basis every now and again.
"there's not a deal there, it starts  it's slightly flaky  straight in."
but what i'm gonna do is give you erm dermavate dermavate is actually more potent than betnovate in the ointment form again to get the rapid penetration.
"and , like betnovate it's used twice a day."
and in a similar fashion you should use the dipabase to keep the skin as soft and moist as you can.
mhm.
letting it get dried out and cracked.
"dermavate is, as i say, it's more potent, it's probably not so suitable for keeping going with, but for jumping things in a hurry, it's fine."
and i think that's what we ought to use.
"sometimes you actually need to use it under something, but it's difficult to use under things and part of the hand."
i don't know what you mean under.
"well under a dressing, or."
oh right.
"under a bit of polythene, so it, it actually gets absorbed even quicker."
mm.
but er i don't think we need to go to that er length with you.
"i've still got those erm, you know, the little purple tablets?"
yeah.
"that dissolve in water,."
"yeah, to soak them."
mm.
"you could, you could go back on the permitabs if you want."
"it's not desperately moist, although certainly one of them is cracking quite , and if that helps to dry it up and make it more comfortable then it's worth giving them a soak ten minutes a day."
mm.
"if you want to try those, you dissolve one in four litres of water which is er which is , just short."
just short of a yeah you need a bowl.
"yeah, but then you get the right concentration."
"if you use too high a concentration, it irritates and it stains even more than the dilute stuff does."
but that may be worth a go if you've got some permitabs left.
mm.
but i think we'll use some dermavate have you got plenty of dipabase.
yeah.
good.
"a big tub, yeah?"
mm.
that's fine.
"is it alright to put that on, you know, when it's broken?"
the skin.
"yes, you've got, you've got to be careful with broken skin because if you put things directly on it, they tend to irritate."
"it won't do the skin any harm particularly, but it can smart."
and.
mhm.
that might be one good reason for using the er the soaks.
"the other think i'd recommend, is, using a fine pair scissors, is take off the scaly bits, the bits that stick out, cos they're the bits that catch."
mm.
and hurt and.
yeah.
pull the skin apart.
"and once they're all sticking out, dead and scaly, they're redundant anyway, so you may trim it all down."
neaten it up.
and you're less likely to catch your hands then.
okay?
okay.
i'm.
"going on holiday, a week on sunday, and that was mainly why i wanted."
mm.
"you know, to get sorted."
yeah.
yeah.
"before then, because."
yeah.
i think if i'm in.
yeah.
"i'm going to spain, it's gonna be even."
right.
more of a nuisance.
yeah i think so.
well let me give you two tubes just you need to keep going for er longer than we might think.
okay.
and then you can take that with you.
so if .
"the other thing about the ointment's, , it waterproofs the hand, which is handy if you're going into the med."
mm.
if you will get some er protection then from the horrible med soup getting in and infecting it.
what about swimming and things?
i mean.
"yeah you're okay, you can go swimming, it shouldn't do you any harm."
"i mean in things like swimming baths are chlorinated so they've got a low bug count anyway, so, so you'll be at low risk of getting anything there."
"right, so i, i use this till it clears."
yeah.
up?
"yeah, and then you you've got your betnovate to keep yourself ticking over with i hope."
mm.
okay.
some people need dermavate to tick over with but er it's potent to keep people going and going and going on so we'll see how you go with that.
lovely.
take care of yourself.
"okay, thanks."
bye.
bye.
can you tell us how you first became involved in the dispute?
"well i was working in the  quarry, and er it's last march  turned round and said he wanted a new  implemented with a new miracle saw that he had bought and he didn't really give us much warning about what he was gonna do but all he said was that er he was gonna scrap our old bonus contract and implement a new one , and from various figures that were bandied about we all realized we were gonna back quite worse off it."
was the implementation of the bonus scheme at that time linked to the new er the new saw table?
i i think so.
"it was partly with the new saw table and also he wanted to try and get more er sellable saleable product the slate, cos previously we had been throwing away quite or giving it to  and i think it really started as a family argument between him and his brother."
"in , his brother in law in  you know and er he was somewhat hurt that his brother in law will  was getting a tremendous share of small blocks and he wanted to make more money them."
how did it become apparent that the new erm bonus scheme was going to operate to your disadvantage?
"well we certainly saw it as a disadvantage, he thought we'd be er very well off with it."
"i think er  through the figures that he was producing we all realized something was up and various computers flying around the place you know, and the figures produced by them."
"that's you know it was all purely hypothetical the figures they produced but er they were comparing it to what we had previously been producing we all realized that for a set production figure we could have been forty pound worse off, per week."
"can you give me some idea of er the level of erm  i'll call it education, the level of education  people that were working er about the bonus scheme that er."
"well i i think er it's it's quite hard to to talk about it but er i i think people were grieved that the bonus system that had been going since the quarry was started up again by  's father was gonna be scrapped with really no consultation with the workers if you like, and i think everybody thought that you know we'd been producing a lot of slate and been paid well for it previously and he should leave well alone."
"you know both sides were very happy you know it was up with the company or down with the company you know, and i think certainly the younger lads saw it as an infringement upon their future, you know we've all got mortgages and the older men who'd been working since the quarry started you know were gonna see a drop in their standard of living, so i think you know people were getting upset you know that a a new fella a new face had come in, and you know changes were being made that were gonna hurt everybody financially."
was the  the  of the new bonus scheme the only cause for unrest at that time?
"i think so yes, yeah."
"yeah, i i can't think of any other things that you know that would have led to us withdrawing our labour,everything else could've settled amicably or through discussions with the union."
no i think it was purely the financial aspect of the thing.
"when it became clear to you that the the new bonus scheme was not operating  to your advantage, how did you go about representing your feelings to the quarry owners?"
"i think almost daily there were discussions between our two shop stewards and the quarry owners about you know, levels of production, expected targets, increase in production and all this, and er i think you know through those daily discussions we made our side of the argument known and we we told him that we'd work to rule if things weren't proper and if we didn't like it."
it's just the attitude about the way he went about the whole thing.
that's what upset us most.
"you know it seemed to be that we had a working rule that had functioned reasonably well over the years and he was tearing up various paragraphs that didn't suit him, and altering bits you know and changing them round just to suit the company, and all to our disadvantage."
er you vindicated that you were in fact talking on quite a sophisticated level with the quarry owners in the sense that you were able to break up your argument into various categories as as you've said.
how how was this sophistication accepted by the quarry owners?
"erm well at one time, when we put various arguments to him, he just turned round and decided that everyone over sixty would be surplus to requirements and er  and sent down the road if you like."
well you know we weren't too impressed with that and the next day he took that back and re-employed them.
"but er no it seems strange you're dealing with a man who's got your future in his in his hands, yet he can turn round and do stupid things like that, and totally just disregard the human aspect if you like."
"you mention the fact that er you were talking to a new manager or relatively new, erm had was the trouble if you like in any way related to the appointment of this new manager?"
"well, i i was fairly new in the company myself so i hadn't worked for his father before  took over the managership or chairmanship or whatever he is, so i i'm really not too sure about the whole thing but certainly for a quarry manager or quarry director or owner, he didn't really know the slate the workers, and he was expecting things his workers and the slate, the product, that were really just not on."
"you know, it couldn't be you know we we couldn't produce what he wanted, and certainly the material wasn't there for the things he wanted to do, and yet he seemed to assume that he knew everything and wouldn't take any advice from the experienced men in the quarry."
was was any attempt made by the the experienced men the one who the ones who understood the rock and been in the presumably been in the industry.
was there any attempt by them to educate him.
well i i think er he's of the age where he was unwilling to learn.
"he thought that modern techniques could be put to use, where in some cases they'd been tried and failed beforehand."
"i mean he went off to italy and bought at great expense a wire saw,have had a wire saw for years and that hasn't proved successful."
"okay in italy on the marble it does work, but on the slate it you know it it hasn't worked and i think various quarries have tried it and found out that it doesn't work, and yet he assumed that he knew better and you know,little little things like that, you know he just seemed unwilling to learn or heed advice."
"was was there any sort of attempt to er  acquisition of expensive equipment now, was there any attempt made to gain the er the knowledge of the workforce on what would be suitable machinery to buy?"
"well i suppose he might have asked some of the fitters, but i doubt it somehow seeing some of the acquisitions that he made from llanberis when they were closing down there."
and he probably asked the quarry manager and the under manager there.
i know the under manager went off to italy to look at this saw.
"but er he never asked me, put it that way, what i thought was suitable machinery and he, as far as i know he never asked other rock men what they thought was suitable for the rock and other slate makers what they thought was suitable for inside the mill, or the diamond saw operators, what sort of saws they thought were the best."
"if you had've been asked, would you  for what he actually bought?"
"certainly the saw he bought for the mill i think that has great prospects and you know there's no two ways about it, it could help production and ease the work of the workforce."
"that, that has to go you know has to be tied in with a bonus contract that suits the workforce."
"and you know, no two ways about it that saw was definitely a a good acquisition."
but various other bits of machinery which are now lying idle around the quarry probably would've been better left in italy or spain or wherever they were acquired from.
"was there a feeling when the this this saw table was acquired,did you have any feeling that it was a way of controlling the wages?"
no i don't think so.
no.
in what way?
"in the sense that production could be upped but your level of income wouldn't not be permitted to rise,."
"oh yeah,in that way er certainly when he produced the bonus contract to go with the saw table, you know we that was fairly plain, that production would have risen in his estimates quite considerably, and yet our wages in fact would have dropped  quite  considerably so, yes i mean er it didn't seem quite to tally in the way we would have like to have seen it."
could you have visualized any way in which  production could have been controlled his  down about a certain amount?
well there's a physical limit to how much we could produce in a an eight hour shift and all the slate makers were adamant that the figures he reckoned they could produce and what they reckoned they could produce you know they were totally different.
"so i mean there is a limit to how much we can earn, you know bonus-wise."
so i i don't think he could control it that much.
but what we realized was that we hit his estimates we were still gonna be worse off.
"after you'd been erm in daily discussions with the management, when did it occur to you that things just not gonna happen?"
"well it was  i'm not quite sure  we we got the other two quarries in the company, in the group of companies, together and told them our problems, and they said right okay fair enough, we'll help you."
"and i think it was, we were willing to go back to work and carry on discussions, albeit without earning any bonus because we were working to rule at the time, but it was what happened in er the  quarry that really started the strike, when he laid the workforce off because they were helping us, or joining us in sympathetic action, you know there was a lockout up there, so i think that speeded up things considerably."
"we all thought right okay, we'll get out for a few days and matters'll come to a head, get sorted out and we'd be back at work, happy as anything you know, everything sorted within a couple of weeks."
unfortunately it was not to be.
what was the reaction when you decided you would work to rule?
"erm, the management certainly weren't too impressed,which is understandable."
"but on the other hand, we were only working to rule, we were working by rules and regulations laid down from various acts and negotiated er agreements."
"but erm certainly we were worse off, cos we were just earning a day rate, any bonus you know we had no bonus ."
"so yeah we all thought, we'll work to rule a couple of weeks, things'll get sorted and we'll all be back to normal."
you said that the other two quarries were linked er with you.
how did you how how did it arise that there was this degree of cooperation?
"well i think there were niggling little points in all the quarries, the workforce certainly hasn't been happy up in  for a long time."
in  i think things have ticked over er various little things have been sorted but all internally without resorting to outside help.
"and because each of the directors seems to have a share in the brother's or brother in law's concerns you know we all thought right, if they're gonna play the game together, we'll play the game together, and see what happens."
"and you know when after we had withdrawn our labour, then various things arose in  that needed sorting out, and the bonus system there, if we thought ours was unfair, their's was totally out the window."
"we were earning some money, and they were ending up owing the company money i think."
"was the the degree of cooperation, was it was it on an informal basis or was it er through the transport and general that you got together?"
"erm, we called a lodge meeting before the annual leave, annual shutdown, and in that lodge meeting all three quarries agreed to go on a work to rule the resumption of work, which is second week of august."
i can't remember in fact if there was a transport official there.
i suppose there must have been but i can't remember.
"so i i think it started on an informal basis, you know everyone was just a little bit with the way they're being treated and the way you know  been told how much we could earn, how we could earn it, when when we could earn it and all this sort of palaver."
so  it started informally.
what was what was the expectation if any er at that time regarding the effect of your action?
"well i think it they've small workforces in each of the three quarries, i think there are twenty in , and twenty odd in  and we thought well twenty men aren't really gonna hurt the quarry the companies, the group of companies that much, because slate will still be produced in the other two."
"so if we can hurt them or certainly gang together if you like, cos unity is strength, and between the three workforces they'll certainly slow down production  and hopefully force things."
"lodge, was there any erm were there any individuals who were particularly keen and had an idea of what they wanted and and who were who were who were obviously older and more organized than the others."
"i think at the onset we all thought, it's not gonna last long you know a couple of weeks at the most."
i remember coming home and discussing with my wife that  another friend that it'd only be a couple of weeks and we'd be back to work.
no i think at the onset we were all well we were all beginners at the game if you like.
so there were no little budding little strike leaders or arthur scargills in the pack.
"so no i think er we all stuck it together at the start, not really knowing where it was gonna lead us."
"why do you think it didn't fail er early on as a strike, er as the fact it was only predicted it would last two or three weeks but it was obvious at the time it was gonna go on."
why didn't it fail?
"well, had we given in then god only knows what would have happened in both our quarry and the other two quarries."
"i'm sure the system would have been implemented in the  quarry, and they would've suffered even worse than us."
in  their bonus would never have been sorted out.
"i think the whole idea of us managing to stick together for seven months, you know the fact that we did, bar a few exceptions, you know it's it's amazing."
with the help of the women.
how in fact did you keep on you said mentioned you were out for seven months.
"when it began to dawn that you were going to be out more than a fortnight or three weeks, did anything emerge that that you can see was to keep you encouraged for that period?"
"i think people from the community, and the quarrying community, they started giving us support, telling us right, we'll help you, both financially and you know physically and what have you, you know the students, the women's support group, when things started getting organized."
"you know then we thought right, we're not just gonna forget about this you know, we'll we'll carry on for a little while longer and then the ball really started rolling, er personally i thought well you can't back down now,."
how how many others do you think had the same reaction to you?
"erm certainly i think all of our quarry, the  quarry, i think we were overwhelmed with the support because it was really in our place that the dispute started and a lot of other people who i'd spoken to you know they they were amazed at the support we received and, seemed to be the shyer the people you know the, some of the lads they never spoke much at lodge meetings, but after a while they'd be getting up and saying their pieces and, you know i think it's just because you knew you had backing, and people helping and urging you on, advising you, and the union helping and you know they leant over backwards in various fields to help us."
we realized we had such tremendous support and you know er right we'll give this a go and we're gonna win.
you mentioned that the  that it was a great encouragement to you to have outside support.
"did it have you any any idea why you had so much support, all ?"
"well, people that i spoke to, spoken to from cardiff, they they originally got involved because one of the lads used to work up in the  factory, the chairman of their labour club, and after that i don't, politically you know it started off completely non political, but after a while people latched it as a dispute that could be won, and you know that would be one up for the workers and the country."
"unfortunately that wasn't to be, i er we came a good second but there you go."
"people latched onto it as something that wasn't a political strike, wasn't being led by militants, revolutionaries, what have you, and it was something, it was just for the freedom of the working man if you like, and his standard of living was not gonna suffer bosses intransigence  i'll say it right in a while,and what have you."
"no we we're not gonna suffer and we're gonna win, we can win."
"you mention the fact that erm there was a feeling that it was a the size of the workforce, it was possibly a strike which could be won?"
"yeah i think, small workforce, i mean twenty in our quarry, if one or two  back to work that's not really gonna help the management."
"you know if you got five or six thousand and a few go back to work you know, they can start getting a production run going, but the nature of our work, everyone depends on everyone else."
really needs the whole twenty men back to start viable production again.
was there a a feeling during that period you were going to win?
oh yeah.
yeah i was convinced we were gonna win.
"at the start, but as things went on, and just the fact that we never had any talks between the union and the management."
"the management refused to talk all the time and after a while it just got depressing, the fact that nothing seemed to be happening."
"how did you explain to your own satisfaction during those months that no talks were going on, that  into into into communicating with the quarry ?"
"no, there was just nothing we could do."
"it'd got to the stage where the workforce were not gonna talk to the management on a an official level, you know we were still talking informally at the picket line and, you know still trying to be helpful and offer our advice on what could be done to solve the dispute."
"but you know further up the ladder, the union officials and what have you, it was just, they tried, the council tried and all this, and nothing seemed to happen."
"had there ever been a a feeling amongst the members of the lodge that erm that with this increasing involvement with outsiders, the local m ps, the ministers of religion, the er transport and general workers' union, , coverage by h t v and the b b c that there would be a kind of accumulation of pressure and you would they would give in?"
"yeah, yeah."
"we all assumed that the, yeah the media pressure, talks would start, but i think possibly the management thought that this one-sided pressure, you know it seemed at the time that nothing nice was being said about the management, you know you can almost understand them being reluctant to go into a room and offering their side of the argument."
"yeah i i think, had they given their side of the argument at the onset, then er things would've been different."
"but because they refused for one reason or another to you know to have talks with the press or television or the ministers, whoever, i think they they burnt their boats."
"at what point erm did er did it become an official dispute,how how  at the point of becoming an official dispute?"
"i think when we were, as far as i can remember is when we were sent either letters of, letters to warn us that we were gonna be dismissed if we didn't turn up for work or either when we were dismissed."
"er from then on, you know, things were really put in put into action."
"was that, was that er on the basis of your acting collectively as a as a lodge or was it again was it shop stewards who acted  ?"
"no, no every decision was taken at the lodge, the shop stewards didn't run the strike  between them and just inform us after every decision was taken by all fifty members at the start and forty members at the finish, and i'm you know i'm proud to say that everyone was part of what went on."
and it wasn't just a few people leading others whichever way they felt was necessary.
"you know sure there were committees to manage either financial affairs, or various other bits and pieces that went on, but even then decisions they took were taken to the lodge to be voted on."
"so in a sense, everything that went on was was erm fully exposed in a sense, everyone."
"yeah, yeah."
knew what was going on?
"i mean everybody knew what was going on, they might have had their own interpretations of what they'd been told, but that happens, and as i said you know, every decision was voted on by the full lodge of the three quarries."
"you know, the decision whether we were gonna go back to work these threatening letters was taken by the forty well fifty members of the lodge, so in effect i was sacked by people who had since returned to work, but you know that's how it should be."
was there any feeling when these letters were received that they were to be taken seriously or they were in fact a bluff?
"erm, i think the wording of the letters was."
"oh  i was in repudiation of my contract well i dunno what what it means to repude some things,you know i jumped to get a dictionary and found out, but i really don't know what my contract was because i don't think we ever had any."
"but you know, certainly the way the letters had been written, and the fact that they became by recorded delivery, you know if it was a bluff, it was, certainly fooled me."
what did you decide er as a as a lodge when these letters were received?
"to be honest i wasn't there, i was down at my sister's wedding."
"but from what i gathered   erm yeah we were gonna carry on, we weren't gonna be forced back to work, cos had we gone back under their conditions, then god only knows what i'd be earning now."
you know about twenty pound a week i suppose or something stupid.
"when er  when the when the strike began to get into into top gear, can you give me any idea of how as a lodge you were organized  er picket duty?"
right.
"when when the strike first started, being in the summer months we needed quite a strong picket line to talk to the tourists, at various gates cos that was the main source of income at the quarry at that time."
"after the tourist season finished, and various cars were either written off or collapsed or whatever, you know whoever had a car was put forward as the picket you know er the leader of that picket er shift, and then it was just a question of working round."
"i think we had twelve or thirteen cars, so that was twelve shifts we could cover, we had three gates to cover cover, so and forty men, and just shared them out and that was all computerized, printed out, everyone had a copy, and on the whole it worked very very well."
"you know we managed to man the gates in working hours and forced the company to shift slate at ungodly hours in the morning, and i think people were impressed that we managed to stick it out."
"you know i think that's the one drawback of having a small workforce, the fact that if one picket didn't turn up, you know all of us on your the force on the gate if you like was er a third of what it could've been."
or a half.
"had you never er this, had you had any experience of er."
none .
none ?
none .
what was it like the  during the first times you went on the ?
"it was it was fun when we first started, because the weather was nice, you know it was er you take a thermos up and have a picnic and sit in the chair and read a book or whatever if there was around, but after a while when it became a duty, yeah it was hard work getting up on a winter's morning, knowing full well that you probably wouldn't see any cars if you down in  until about ten in the morning, but you still had to be there at seven o'clock, and honking it down with rain or whatever."
no it was it was hard work after then.
"in the erm in the early days, how did you how did you approach the people who were coming up the gate?"
"i think from what i've heard, every shift had its own little methods of trying to turn people away or advising them not to come in."
"certainly we just told them what the problem was, told them that there was ever such a nice quarry further down the road if they wanted to visit a slate quarry."
and for that i think  are very thankful.
". and er we were truthful, we tried to put our side of the argument, you know there were the few people who said, well i don't really care, and drove in."
"well you know, you win some you lose some."
but every shift had its own methods.
and i won't say any more than that.
"you you mentioned that er after the time presumably when the the winter began to come on, erm became more of a an obligation  how did you keep  motivated to turn up?"
"i think it was just the thought that if one shift didn't turn up or if people stopped turning up, then others wouldn't turn up and it'd just escalate until everyone was just sitting at home the fire and the quarries would function as normal, and the fact, well certainly with me, i thought well we have to make an appearance to show people that we are still on strike and keep, you know everyone who drives past us will be saying, ah hello what's up with them?"
"they'll be reading about it in the paper then, trying to find out, spreading the word, and you know every every time someone drove past the picket line, there was a bit of bad publicity for the quarries and helpful for us."
do you think your perspective was a commonly held one?
"no there were others who thought, sod it i'm not gonna turn up, you know, why should i?"
"and i don't know, certainly the shift i was with were very loyal, always turned up and you know we we never had any problems."
there were other shifts where various people after a while dropped out.
but you know i think certainly the shift i was with you know i er i was impressed.
"the ones who erm who stuck it  the ones who were always there, who always turned up, was there anything about them which could  which could er er identify them as as people who were, was it age or  ?"
"no no i think there were all sorts, all ages, i  i think just maybe some were more dedicated to the job and certainly after a couple of weeks it wasn't family if you like you know, family in inverted commas, there ."
"no i think just dedication and we, if we made an appearance maybe something would come to a head, things would get sorted, if we just said forget it then stay at home, then the quarry managers would say right forget it, we'll get another workforce in, you know it was, i think it was just i think some were dedicated to the job and gave it their best, whereas others were slightly you know, willy nilly about it and well i'll turn up today cos it the weather looks nice, or i'll turn up today because the wife isn't off and or the gas has run out or whatever."
during this erm this period what sort of  business was being transacted in the lodge?
"erm well certainly tom would come up every every week, tell us what had happened, if anything."
unfortunately most weeks nothing had happened.
and quite often it er degenerated into an argument about picket duties.
and the fact that quite a lot of people hadn't turned up on a certain day or that sort of thing.
"no i think it was just, certainly tom tried to lift us or because over the winter months when nothing was happening negotiations-wise, you know he knew if he didn't lift us then nothing would and everyone would get so disheartened they'd just say oh sod it and back to work or forget it and what have you."
so er business-wise i don't think much went on but he's more of an uplifting experience.
was his er presence  would you interpret his his presence as being fairly crucial for the continuing of the strike?
whichever way i answer this erm it's gonna be .
"i think certainly we had to have a figurehead to relate to and in my opinion, tom was the best one to have there."
"you know when his boss came in then things went downhill but yeah certainly tom helped me and  just the fact that there was someone there who knew exactly what was going on, be it not a lot but, he was trying to help us, and give us advice and what have you."
you know i think he was fairly crucial to keep us all together.
"are you more say on a  more personal level, was it obvious during the lodge  meetings that people who were out  people were out, were under pressure to go back?"
"erm, i think at the back of some people's minds there was this pressure, you know that's why a few did return to work and i mean i can understand some of them returning to work but not necessarily for the reasons they've stated."
"erm i think they probably thought their jobs were at threat or the continuation of employment in their quarry and the quarry would shut down which management had certainly hinted at, yet which i considered to be a bluff, because 's gonna kill the goose that lays the golden egg."
"but in a lot of people's minds, no i don't think there was that you know that threat ."
there certainly wasn't in mine because i'd i'd been sacked.
"was there any sort of how can i put it, any sort of feeling that certain individuals in the lodge would go back to work?"
"yeah i think at the onset of the strike there were a few people who were considered likely to be forced to get back to work or to go back to work, what they'd said, well just you know what they say in the meetings or what they didn't say in the meetings."
you indicated that er in a sense the strike became well organized in the sense it had a great deal of support erm both moral and material and presumably financial .
presumably.
erm was there any part of it of the strike organized in the sense of you giving moral support within the lodge to people who were obviously wavering?
i think that's one of the reasons tom was there.
"you know he was always saying, well next week things might get better."
"so stick together lads just for another week, whatever we do, if we go back to work or if we stay out, it'll be a unanimous vote or a majority vote in this lodge, you know we came out together, we'll go back together or we'll stay out together."
he didn't want to lose people by the wayside you know and i think that was the feeling of most of us.
"and that's what upset us most about these people going back to work, the fact that a meeting had been taken a few months before in which everybody had voted for us to get the sack, and then they had been threatened and no vote was taken on whether we should stay out or go back, and they just dribbled back to , that really knocked us i think."
the ones who.
"eventually return to work, were they in any sense identifiable as a a group?"
"yeah i think they had their own little meetings in various pubs or whatever after our meetings, and certainly the management in one of the quarries seemed to have a lot of information about what went on in our lodge meetings various members of this clique,i think we were all fairly sure that they would be returning to work, it was just when that was the crunch."
what was the feeling in the lodge when it eventually happened.
"erm, we weren't too impressed er to put it mildly."
"but on the other hand we thought i suppose oh good riddance you know er have a few er namby-pamby people you know sitting on the fence, we might be better off without them."
"but i think the number that went back, you know the small workforce  the fact that eight or nine returned to work, you know that was virtually half the workforce in one quarry, it made it quite awkward then."
"did you decide er either formally or informally, to take a particular attitude towards the ones that had gone back?"
"i think everyone's got their own ways of dealing with them, you know certainly some people ignore them, you know i prefer to ignore them taunt them, er possibly because i wasn't really friendly with any of them that did go back, i think people who were close friends have found it very awkward and i know even now they're probably looking daggers at you know, that sort of thing."
it certainly the community because of them.
did you do you think their their return to work was in any sense crucial to the outcome of the strike?
"oh yeah, yeah."
"i think had we managed to stick it together longer, all fifty of us, and just prove to the management that we weren't gonna be starved back to work which seemed to be the way they wanted us to go back, you know because the board had you know escalated, you know i think had we managed to stick it together, certainly the result would've been different."
"i can't say what it would've been, you know what the outcome would've been but it would've been different."
"was there any was there any sense when when i suppose it's one fifth of the workforce returned, was there any sense do you feel er that you weren't going to win?"
"no i think, i thought we still had a chance, albeit you know the odds had gone down a bit or increased, but er no i thought we still had a chance, it was gonna be harder because if we lost any more by the wayside then you know you're gonna be, it would've been very awkward."
no i think we still thought we had a chance.
you mentioned about erm not being starved back to work.
erm which brings in the .
"oh yeah, brilliant."
"when  first started, can you can you  what you what you felt about it, what you thought it was going to do?"
"well, i think some of the women and a lot of the men thought right well we'll just keep it you know between the men, it's our problem, we'll get it sorted."
"after a while we realized you know that's not on, it's impossible for us to sort this out you know we need help."
"i think the wives found it to their benefit to get amongst other wives who were sharing the same problems you know, how to pay the bills, how to buy food, and i think they seemed to get organized pretty well, they certainly helped us a hell of a lot."
"you know without the women's support group especially and without other support you know, we would've been starved back to work."
"was there any sense in which a there was a surprise at the reaction of the women, that they  first of all became very organized and were very organized and  determined, so determined?"
"well at the start of the strike, my wife was just narked that i was work, but after a while when she fully understood the reasons, i think, i'd like to think that she was a hundred behind me and the rest of us."
and certainly by what she did with the women's support group i think she was.
"and the determination of the women, that we weren't gonna be starved back to work, we weren't gonna be forced back to work, we weren't just gonna end in chaos and some of us going back and some of us staying out, i think it was the women possibly talking to their husbands or, and just reassuring , you know that helped us no end."
"has erm as a lodge, did did you  anything from the sort of organization the women had?"
oh yeah.
"i mean they outclassed us no question,no two ways about it , i dunno what it is."
"i hate to admit it in fact but er, no the way they got things organized, got lecture tours, rallies and what have you together, you know i think er taught us an incredible  amount ."
have you have you got any er idea of how it came about that a group was so organized?
"i think possibly because there were outsiders in the group, i dunno."
possibly because some of them might've been councillors and knew the ways that sort of er things went on and how to get things done officially and above board.
"you know we were all amateurs at the game, the workers, but some of the women you know do it professionally, had worked elsewhere, knew how things went on elsewhere you know, with the d h s s or whatever."
i think possibly because women are slightly more organized and what have you.
you know they're used to a household budget and they know how to manage on however x many pounds a week.
"and if you take half of that away you know they know how to manage on that , somehow."
do you think that realization had  had hadn't surfaced until that?
i never knew my wife was such get up and goer if you like.
erm never knew she could write such good lectures or speeches.
"you know she's been hiding her light under a bushel, a bush."
"has any is there way in which you from your observation there,the erm there's been a  in in the relationship between the men and the and the women involved involved as a consequence of er this kind of activity?"
"well i i don't know really but er certainly i i probably discuss work a lot more with my wife now than before, and let her know what's going on there."
and probably other people do .
"you know because, i think we all thought it was our problem, we can sort it out."
"you know, typical male attitude you know, women  no help ."
and after a while you know it was without the women we would've been you know nothing.
what what was the sort of erm help what did er did you observe was was given from the support group?
"i think just the fact that my wife knew what was going on, and knew the problems exactly you know, they had their own meetings and the food parcels that they could organize, you know i wouldn't have a clue how to go about it, the fact that various shops refused to have collection points inside, and they wrote off to the management of these shops and got that changed."
no they just seemed to know how to go about things better than we did.
"we realized oh hang on a minute you know, they're not all bad these women ,erm no really we couldn't do without them."
"the, it's been put to me to er interview various people or listen to other people if they can tell me about."
mm.
"the strike, that the old men."
oh yeah.
"if he had been in charge, things would have been very different."
do you think that erm a true statement?
i think it's it's hard for me to say because i didn't work for him .
you know his son took over shortly after i joined the company.
"certainly from what i've heard, things would never have happened the way they did, and i think from the sort of very short dealings i had with him, things wouldn't have happened they way they did."
"whether they, you know financially we'd be better off or worse off i really couldn't say ."
i don't think we would've been standing outside the gates .
what would be the essence of the difference then between him and his son .
i think possibly respect for the workforce.
"you know his father had started the company and the men, the older men in the quarry had been there from day one with him, you know from when they were producing nothing to being quite a profitable concern, and he realized the value of these men, and that you couldn't just say, oh because they disagree with you just well, down the road pal."
he realized that experience in the quarrying industry is certainly something that you don't get rid of.
"you know fair enough, some of the older men can't move as fast as a eighteen year old, but on the other hand it's what they got in their head that counts."
"i don't know, just generally respect for the workforce."
"but this er this this feeling of erm not being respected,do you think in that was in any sense a an important motivation for just sticking it out amongst the older men?"
"erm i think they knew that if we went back under his conditions, their days would be numbered certainly."
"you know he'd far prefer to have two or three youngsters earning considerably less, who absolutely nothing about the industry than one slightly older, certainly vastly more experienced man and you know paying him more."
"you know he'd far prefer to have the cheap workforce that you could tell exactly and appear to know what he's talking about, whereas the older men knew that he knew absolutely  nothing ."
"was there  any sense of surprise really that as the quarrier was were welshmen and most of the workforce were welshmen that in fact things would come to some sort of agreement, that there wouldn't be this kind of."
"as an outsider , probably being the only englishman in the quarries, you know i i think they were surprised, the fact that it was a local family, i think that's what really rubbed them up the wrong way."
"er they'd been to chapel with them, been to school with them, worked in other places with them, and it ended like it did."
you know that that did surprise a lot of them.
"but i don't know quite how the welsh mentality works you know you know loyalty to one's nation or whatever, but er no,looking from the outside you know, i i thought it was strange that sort of next door neighbours could end up you know completely opposed to ."
do you think it in any sense has damaged the community?
"oh yeah, it certainly has."
without a question.
"no erm er even now, and the  the strike's been finished i can't remember four months or something, three months, you know the community i think it'll take a a hell of a long time to heal the rifts and mend the scars."
"possibly caused by people returning to work, i think those are the ones that really opened up the community and dropped people on either side of the fence sitting it."
"do you think er you and your your mates who were out, do you think you learnt anything from the strike?"
"erm, well yeah i've learnt that my wife is more use than just in the kitchen."
"no i think, you you realize why you're in a trade union and why you need the press and the media to help you, you know you can't just ignore them."
"and also why you've got to talk to people, you know get your problems out in the open let them build up and just say right,that's it, out the gates, or down tools."
"and i think you know the management ought to learn, hopefully they will learn a bit by that ."
you i infer from that you er you saying that if the same thing  this is this is  that if the same thing were to occur again your approach would be  and you'd be more more of a strategist in the handling of it.
"oh yeah, yeah."
i mean second time around you know what's gonna go on.
mm.
and i know full well now what it's like to be standing on a picket line for seven months.
"and it's not something that i enjoy, you'll try every which way to try and avoid it."
"but if a matter came to a head that withdrawing my labour was the only way to resolve it, that i thought was the only way to resolve it, i'd go out and do it again."
"in those early days, was there a feeling that withdrawal of labour would in fact bring about the effect that you wanted?"
"oh yeah, yeah."
"just chatting with some of my mates, you know, oh it'll be over in a couple of weeks."
that was always the way we thought.
but that was not to be.
"was there any special way in which you contributed to the  in the strike, any particular skills you were called upon to ."
"well, everyone seemed to think that i knew what i was doing with a computer, so the shifts, the picket shifts were left me, any facts and figures needed, databases,addresses were left me."
any printouts and things.
but no i think er they thought i could speak english better than some of themselves so they sent me off to english universities or wherever to put across our problems.
.
"well,, what can we do for you tonight?"
er  .
must be five pound notes you keep in there.
good  and passport.

"i've been doing well for the last week, but i took this heavy cold, well from thursday, since i've took this heavy cold i've hardly smoked."

i've hardly smoked.
i've done really well.

"yes,."
there you go.

"cos it's splitting, i think it's just the cold."

"there you are, and that'll help to turn you into a human being."
"i've been helping everybody who's took that flu, and i think i've ."
it's reached you.
away home and look after yourself.
never mind the rest of these puddings.
let them get their own prescriptions.
"you're too soft, you and celia."
aye you are.

"oh, everybody  me."

"och, sure you're worried about her."

sure you're worried about her?
"right, okay,, cheerio now."
cheerio.
erm my first job was erm helping the keeper.
with the pheasants.
i started there when i was about fifteen and er erm they used to breed about er six hundred pheasants there you see.
and my job was to going round with the keeper and feeding them every morning.
"they used to have a erm hens there you see, they used to go round the small farms buying hens, then for half a crown each, just for sitting on the eggs to hatch them."
"and then they used to put them in er er small boxes out in the field and er i used to go round in the woodlands and cut some  you see, put them in the ground with a small branch on them and then we used to make some string and loops erm wire to go round their feet you see."
and then we used to put these loops the  through the loops and tie their legs to the string.
and have them in the  get their feed first thing in the morning you see.
"and they finished their feed and they had some drinks from the small tins , we used to put them one by one back in these boxes where the eggs were and they used to settle down straight off then after they had their feed and  and they used to erm settle down no trouble ."
and then the old keeper used to come round and see that we were and they'd be there till the following day and carry on for about three or four weeks you see.
"and then as they hatched you see, you used to take them into the incubator then."
"because we had finished with the hens then you see, and they used to sell the hens for about two shillings or something like that you know."
in the old time.
"and then erm they eggs would be in this incubator for about a week and then they used to arrange coops for them to go out do you see, we used to fence a field below the mansion,, in the field there, because there was a good enclosure right round the two drives and then there were shelter you see."
and then we used to fence it half .
and get a shed there or a hut anyway.
"and then we used to put some coops there and small runs for them and we used to carry them there, every night because they settled down better in the night than in the daytime."
and the hen with  back again there if they hadn't sold them.
take the hens .
and erm we used to have about six hundred in all there they say.
"and then when they had come about two months old, something like that, er we used to carry them out now, into the woodlands and  with the rest of the hens."
into the woodlands.
at night.
"as when it was eight to nine o'clock at night sometimes twelve o'clock, depends on how many was going out."
because they settled down better in the night in the woodlands.
mm.
"if you took them in the daytime, they'd come back, but taking them in the dark, when they were asleep into the woodlands, they'd settle much better do you see."
in the bushes and all that.
"and then we used to after that, we used to go out, every in the morning and at night, taking some feed out, to them wherever they were do you see."
"now then, after they cut the  in the farm, all the rakings erm there might be about four or five loads there do you see."
"they used to take the what they called the rakings, the spare  after they carried the sheaves in."
the spare of the of the straw and there was some er seed among them do you see.
used to take a load of that to one part of the woodlands.
"another one to another part there, ."
about four or five.
and then we used to call them  because that's where we were feeding them do you see.
"after they had settled down among the bushes, we used to take these do you see."
"and then they would walk for them do you see, do their way up for them."
and then we used to feed them on these rakings there do you see.
"er twice, morning and night."
"and er if you went quietly back after putting the feed out say before dark, put the feed down there and you went quietly back and watched them, you wouldn't believe how many would have been there."
there'd be about two or three hundred.
perhaps on the same  erm pheasant .
because there were some old ones there before the young one had've gone there do you see.
and erm then they settled down.
there on that patch do you see.
now then my my place for feeding was the upper side of  do you see.
"all the woodlands of the upper side, there was three three feedings there."
three erm place to feed them.
and we used to watch them.
go there sometimes about four o'clock give them a feed out and then we used to i used to stay there in a small shelter there.
"and they'd go down right over the main road, right over the fields, over the railway, through the fields along the beach there."
"and about four o'clock to five o'clock, they'd be coming back."
and as they were coming back they would be cawing.
for used to go over the road and they used to go over the railway.
"you could hear them coming from the distance, back."
and they make to the same place to  their feed.
and that's in that place just round about there.
that's where they were roosting overnight on the trees.
just on that path there do you see.
and they'll come from oh two or three miles back to the same tree.
same tree every night.
no different tree.
but to the same tree.
"and the the trees they would like to come was the  pines and the  pines because they they've got a mop like of of leaves do you see, and they were well sheltered there, among these."
and they were hidden among them do you see.
so they were quite warm there.
doesn't matter what the weather was.
they were quite warm there.
and they'll come to that tree every night.
"the same  about forty to fifty on that field on that tree, they'd come to that tree every night."
doesn't matter where they were.
"and erm the keeper, had from  up towards the mountain do you see."
three er feedings there again.
"and then that was there, the old ones and all."
"from the past, used to come there do you see and feed."
and roost in the same spot there.
aye.
"and then , i was to go round with him, say in the afternoons or some mornings, and he had heard about a fox somewhere."
perhaps up in the  or up in the mountain.
"we used to go after lunch, straight up to the mountain or wherever the fox was."
"and dig them out, young cubs and all."
did you?
aye.
and catch them alive in the burrows.
and that was a job.
"and er we used to dig down, we used to put the the dogs in, used to have about two or three terriers."
put them in.
and block all the holes.
perhaps you'd block all the holes.
perhaps you'd put one in.
just to mark.
"and then we used to listen with our ear on the ground and we could hear where the dog was do you see, and then we used to dig down there because we knew it was fighting there with the with a vixen do you see."
the fox we used to we used to dig down there and come to the vixen.
"and then the old keeper, he was quicker than i am, because i was erm because he was used to the job do you see."
"and then i was taken the dog out slowly do you see, and the old vixen coming out forward do you see."
"and he used to have a small piece of stick with a  on the end of it, cut from er a tree or a bush."
"and she puts her head down out for the for the dog do you see, fighting, he used to put this v on her back, right at the back of the the the neck."
just above you know on the scruff scruff anyway.
and hold her down.
"and the he could get his hand do you see, round her nose anyway, around her snout."
"catching hold of her and she couldn't get back do you seem because he had slipped this hand down this stick, got hold of her and he  you see, and then i let go of the dog and take the the front feet and we used to drag her out like that you see, from the burrow and put her in a bag."
"she was in the sack, it was a sack then, you wont get them now."
sack.
"she was in the sack, she was as quiet as a lamb."
very very quiet.
and then.
not struggling?
no struggling .
"she was in the bag,."
mm.
she was quiet like a lamb.
no  .
"we used to tie her in there and get the cubs out then do you see, we used to dig for the cubs."
"they might be about er a month old, perhaps six weeks old and we used to get them sometimes, most of the time we would get about four there, sometimes three."
"and we used to catch them alive, take them out, put them in a bag together again, and off home again do you see."
and then er we used to make a a big chest for her do you see.
you used to have two or three old chests there.
"and we used to take one of them, do it up, put some straw in and everything and all that and then, tie there was a ring in the ground you see in one of the ."
"and a chain there and we used to tie her to this chain she could get into the box and out again, and then we used to put the cubs there first in the straw and then we used to put her there do you see."
"just take take the bag, put it in and let go and then shut her there for the night, just for one night."
and with a lead on and off do you see.
"and then in the night when it was dark, the old keeper used to come there, open the top of the lid and shut the door, because she was in a she was in a loft do you see, above the kennels, with er an iron er ladder going up and down you see, and then  shut the door on her there do you see and she could get in and out then from the chest."
and then the job was on the following days was after  be shooting rabbits to feed them do you see.
"for about oh, three or four weeks."
till we had a customer do you see through the office in .
"a customer from somewhere in england, where they used to  hunt them do you see."
i see.
"and then er perhaps they were get a customer in about two or three weeks perhaps, less than that sometimes."
"and then, the next job was to make a a a crate for her to go on the railway do you see."
erm er erm big crate with some strips of wood along the top.
and then plenty of straw and everything and put the old vixen in and the cubs and some food for and then the old erm the old er  erm what did they used to call it?
oh the  not a land rover then..
mm.
that's what they call it.
aye the .
that's when they used to come up and put it in the  straight on to the station.
and then the depot on and off to wherever was the place like.
aye aye.
and we had finished with them.
aye.
"another time was  about october, i don't know what he was doing with them, but  in october, middle of october, we used to go out to the beach and shoot erm  oh what do you call them now?"
they've got long beaks like that.
"you can hear them  in the summer, just before dusk in the swamps."
the er the curlews?
"curlews, that's it."
the curlews.
"used get as much as he could of them, i don't know was it to keep the the amount of them down or not."
i'm not quite sure.
because they used to be in the swamp hours.
"hours in the swamp and when they were going all thick and heavy there, he used to go round about october, just for that one day, and shoot as much as he could, and bring them into the mansion."
what they were going  i don't know.
aye and er he had a special gun for that job.
it was a about thirty six barrel.
length of barrel.
and he used to take cartridges erm about an inch and a half thick and about three inches long.
specially made.
single barrel.
and on the end of the erm stock there was the  to take the kick do you see.
and er sometimes you'd have a stand for it because it was too long.
"and he used to have a small stand on it do you see, to hold the barrel, and then he could manoeuvre around just like a machine gun."
"wherever the birds where, aye."
and for shooting er wild erm  geese.
and er wild ducks .
"in fact, they used to call it the gun for the wild ducks do you see."
"and they used to be coming erm about the end of september through the beginning of november, they used to come to the beach from different directions, during that time."
and that was the time to shoot them.
"aye, different birds."
erm er different ducks erm   and  ducks.
aye.
"were the small ones, all different colour."
but the  were creamy white  the big ones then were the ones for eating anyway.
aye aye.
yes and i had a lot of er experience with  with training dogs and all that for hunting the old foxes and all that.
did you?
yes.
yes.
on er was it on foot?
yes.
"oh yes, on foot aye, aye."
and erm we used to carry erm  used to have a pair of binoculars with him and i used to have the old er telescope do you see.
"and er we used to look if we could see some on the side of the mountains from the distances you could pick it out with a pick them out with er with this telescope it was a heck of a good telescope, aye."
"it was so good, this telescope, we had, when i was watching the pheasants, in the field, i used to be there all day for the  the carrion crows would come along do you see."
then we had to shoot them do you see.
the carrion crows.
"and it was funny, the carrion crows to keep away for the whole week nearly."
"but when the sunday morning used to come, the old  and the old erm scotch keeper used to tell me, tom, he used to say, i you know it's sunday again?"
"yes, i said,look at them crows, he says to me, they know it's sunday because you'd never shoot on a sunday."
no.
no?
"he was a scotchman, he would never shoot on a sunday."
"doesn't matter if he saw his fox, he wouldn't shoot it on a sunday."
no.
aye he was very very keen er keep the sunday clean.
aye.
aye aye.
and er the only thing we could do then was to chase them away go round you know and just chase them away.
. but this telescope  the field was just below .
the mansion of .
and i could see right across the fields and right across the menai straits onto beaumarais.
from there and i had this telescope.
"and i could see during the week this was,in the mornings you know, say about eight or nine to ten in the morning, and i could see the figures of the ladies there, cleaning the windows in the morning."
and the front.
"you couldn't see them right if you were a few yards from them, but just the figures moving you know, and their arms going backwards and fore cleaning the windows."
"yes, it was so good as that."
it was a good telescope.
"aye, aye."
one of the best i ever saw.
aye.
"and erm you could see a long distance with it like that you know, especially if you could see a fox from er about a mile and a half, you could see right going along the rocks in the mountains."
aye.
aye.
"and erm say the fox had been in the ground, and the  and the the young cubs, for about three or four days."
and we used to hear somebody saying there was a vixen there and some and some young ones.
we went up there with the dogs and let them in in to the burrow.
"block everywhere, let them into the burrow."
"one dog would go in, and she'd just shake her tail and come back, and you couldn't get her in afterwards because she knew that they'd cleared off."
i see.
they had moved.
yeah.
"anyway the scent was there, but she was wise once she had gone through, oh it's alright."
"she wouldn't go in then, and you knew then, well they've gone."
"what they were doing, the old vixen was walking them higher up into the mountain for safety."
"and the old dog knew that it was empty, no use  digging down or anything, she had gone do you see."
"aye, they were quite wise like that."
yes.
"and one time, i remember, er we had gone among the rocks there, and we had er two erm  two fox terriers there."
and one was  fox terriers.
"and er that one would fight, doesn't matter what was there, it'd fight its way out."
"anyway, when i came in, and he  he didn't come out."
it was oh about two to three o'clock in the afternoon.
and he didn't come out.
dark when the it came dusk and dark again and he hadn't come out.
and we left him there  and we went home.
"up there about six o'clock in the morning, ad we managed to get him out them."
"and he was bitten all over his face, everywhere."
and the old keeper knew what was there alright when he saw the old dog coming out.
it was erm  badger.
a badger.
badger den aye.
mm.
and that one was fighting with the dog do you see.
"because they've got a shelf do you see, in the burrow,for safety."
"if er something comes in, they can attack him on his back do you see."
"and that's what happened you see, he had him on."
about his ears and all his face like that.
but the old dog survived alright.
aye.
aye.
the old keeper he knew how to treat him and he was on alright in about a month.
aye aye.
but erm we set some traps then .
gin was one then.
you could use them.
"we went back with these traps, put them in a half circle right round, bout nine of them, anyway."
"and er a fox trap the gin trap, that one's a bigger one."
"anyway, the following day he was there."
"the third day, in the trap."
aye.
aye.
he had gone to the big one and he wandered about his  two in his legs.
"aye, we couldn't go near him, we  shoot him from a distance,."
aye.
and that one we were doing in the meantime.
"between the feeding, the pheasants and all that, aye."
and i was there for the erm  oh about fourteen months in all with the shooting.
how how old were you.
"and they were starting shooting the pheasants about then, it's altered now."
it used to be the twenty first of october.
mm.
right through to the middle of january.
yes and we used to have about two or three er days of shooting during that erm that period anyway.
aye aye.
aye.
yes and er we used to have about two hundred three hundred birds on the for the shooting and then perhaps about a hundred and fifty or so or something like that on the second.
"and erm we used to help er  in the woodlands then, used to give us a help."
and they'd be all down in the cellar do you see.
"and up in the cellar, after the shooting, we had to make them to a brace like that, a cockerel and a hen."
in a brace.
and hang them up in the cellar all night.
"because there was two or three rooms there do you see, a proper place for hanging up."
"and the following day, we had to go in and help  and pack them in hampers."
do you see.
specially made for them.
"pack them there, the whole braces."
aye.
and erm take them and down two two or three loads down to the station.
pack them off.
"for manchester, liverpool and er different places like that."
"aye, aye."
aye.
"and , on the shooting, they used to have a good feed of you know in the mansion in the cellar."
aye.
"all tables laid out, all kinds of meat and puddings and everything."
yes?
yes.
"and plenty of drinks, aye aye."
who would be at the shoot then?
well they used to invite do you see.
"lord  and er there used to be one  from this way, portmadoc somewhere, the place was  the place was called ."
and erm that one was just along beyond caernarfon here somewhere.
"and anglesey, i remember  from anglesey, he was from  that way somewhere."

"and erm some from towards er  that way, from the estate there somewhere."
"used to be about four or five you know, aye."
and the major himself .
and er the some of the the family .
yes.
"i remember one lady there, she was only young, and she was she was only about twenty five, and er she had a  a twelve bore, single barrel gun."
"i thought it was too heavy for her, she was only small."
but she was the second best shooter there.
"for the day, for bringing them down."
aye.
was she?
aye.
everybody was surprised.
she was such an accurate er shooter.
"aye, aye."
aye.
"you see one, was close to the woodlands and in fact  missed, she was just in the bottom of the field, and she's sure to get the bird."
". and then as we were beating you see, inside, through the bushes and all, and a pheasant got up, and we used to shout,, do you see, for them to know that he was coming."
aye.
but the noise of him and the flapping was good enough sign too.
yes.
"and i had been loading for the major the last time that i was out shooting, the last time for me like."
aye aye.
"aye, the one that used to was poorly ."
he  a loader for him.
aye aye.
two guns .
and then you had to be quick at it you know.
"keep two cartridges in your hand all the time, and then you'd handed your gun, and you were taking the other one, and he was  the empty one."
"they used to swing out themselves do you see, just open  trigger handle for the barrel to open, they used to spring out , and then put the two new ones in you see and close it straight off."
"and you had to be quick you see, because the birds sometimes used to come and stop over."
"yeah, yeah."
yes.
"and then and  used to miss you know sometimes he would be missing every one nearly and he'd be cleaning his glasses all the time , dash it   ."

"and er then i carried on in the woodlands then, cutting trees down and erm sawing up too."
i was on the circular saw there for about eight or ten years.
doing nothing only sawing all day.
"aye, that was during the wartime, aye aye."
aye.
"and erm felling, trees."
"cutting trees for blocks for them, for roads."
"and they used to go through about oh i should say about  erm carts then you see, horse and carts."
and they used to take about six loads a day  you see.
of er blocks.
er every week.
they had to go through a lot of blocks.
"and about seven to eight, truckloads of coal."
"they used to have them in the summer, ready for the winter."
and they used to stack them all in the cellar.
for the twelve months like.
aye.
and erm the trucks were about.
yes and i was there till  about erm  nineteen fifty three.
i started in .
august nineteen fifty three.
and i was there till i was erm twenty six years in .
aye altogether.
yes.
"and my work here, i used to do in  i used to plant a lot in ."
of trees.
"but in when i came to , it was mostly erm planting threes again."
"and in  i was planting an average, there was five of us working  and the students and we used to average about fourteen to sixteen thousand every year of young plants."
but clearing was a job mostly.
"i didn't mind planting, we were quick planting, but clearing for planting, that was the worst job do you see."
you  and open the ditches and all that.
. aye aye.
"but erm going back to  er to , twice we had an oak land fire."
twice.
i remember it was oh about nineteen twenty eight something like that it was.
and it had been a heck of a storm.
and we had a plantation right out in  the erm warren.
and it was a plantation of er .
"and we didn't go there to cut them because they were right open, right in the open and there was ho hope for them anyway."
"we left them there to season, we didn't bother."
and er we had  then.
"anywhere we were clearing the river up because  blocked that, one summer day and it was very hot for about a month or so."
and we were at it clearing this there right in in the hollow.
and there were some er foresters .
they  when they had bought bought a a plantation of larches.
you want them for pit props.
and they they had bought them.
"and they had these two or three foresters there, cutting them up."
and we could hear somebody calling and shouting.
we couldn't make out what was wrong.
"and er they were still whistling and calling, so i went up the top of the bank and they  it was this plantation that fell down in the warren and caught fire."
"somebody had been picnicking there do you see, in the warren and left some bottles there."
and the sun caught the bottles and set the fire to the undergrowth of the grass do you see.
and it was all peat.
"all these trees had been growing on peat do you see, and the peat was dry."
"anyway we went up there but we couldn't do anything because the ground had taken fire do you see, all this peat."
and the rabbits were bolting out from their house.
and they had no single hair on.
"they were as clean you know, the backs of them as clean as my hand."
"they had not because the ground was on fire do you see, and they were bolting out."
and screaming.
you could hear them squeaking off from a distance.
and we were trying to kill them everything .
take them their misery but you couldn't cope with them because the ground was moving with them.
oh we felt terrible for them.
"anyway, the trees were all burnt to dust."
aye aye.
it wasn't only about half an acre or less.
aye.
"all the trees, but they had all fall down do you see, flat."
"and , they had seasoned by then and they were just like matches going, aye."
"and we didn't bother, we couldn't do anything  much for these rabbits and try and kill them you know, as much as we could aye."
aye.
er it was better to leave it to burn out do you see.
and the second fire i had was just before the last war.
we had been clearing oh about six acres of woodlands.
"been all been cleared erm  what we used to call it, cut and clear felled you see."
all cleared.
"ready for planting, and , oh there were some twigs and everything ."
"i remember we cleaned it all up, and it was right on the boundary wall between  property and ."
and we had a small  bonfire in a way of small twigs and all that.
all the undergrowth.
"and we had put it on fire and it had died down, you could have put it on two or three shovels, when we were leaving the place do you see, and it was all quiet and all  now, and off we went home."
"about four o'clock in the morning, the following morning, a farmer was knocking on my door."
"and he said, come here, the whole forest is on fire."
i couldn't believe it till i went out.
dressing gown and off i went out.
to the front of the house and then like we see all the side and the on fire.
"so i went back, dressed, and off i went, called the  and i went up to try and beat it off."
"no hopes, it was travelling under our feet, non-stop."
we were beating and beating.
"anyway in the end, they called the the fire brigade."
we we could see it was going control.
"even big old trees you know, they were coming down."
mm.
"burning and the top of them coming down you know, it was dangerous."
"and the fire brigade was coming along the road, we could hear it coming you know."
"and it came a heavy shower, thunder shower."
"and it lasted about three quarters an hour, and it all damped down."
we were as glad as anything when we saw this rain coming down.
"we were soaked to the skin, we didn't care ."
we could stop the fire.
"because it was travelling you know, on er oh a line of about  ooh i'm sure about six hundred yards."
because he had gone back to the woodlands where the trees were.
"and it was going along through the woodlands, travelling  like the river ."
and  covered in sweat.
"but when this rain came down, it was like it had been sent to stop it you know."
"a heavy rain, we were soaked in about five minutes, soaked to the skin."
aye.
aye.
"but it stopped it like that, it was only just smouldering you know."
"and and  of the fire brigade, we couldn't do anything better."
they all turned back that was all.
"aye with their tankers, aye aye."
that's the only two fires i had.
"and what happened you see,the wind got up during the night, and this small fire we had you see, started spreading back among the undergrowth, and then the more it was  back, the bigger it was gaining ground, and it was getting to the old stuff do you see, and then it was a good flare then."
"and it started, we could see where it started from, this fire."
and it was like a black carpet all the way.
aye aye.
"if we had put some two or three stones on it you see, that'd been better."
"but we thought it was alright, we didn't bother."
"i mean it was right up to the wall, and the we'd have bothered."
but you can see what will happen.
and it was right through.
"yes and when i came to , as i was saying we were clearing  all half of ."
"cos they didn't have the whole park, only i think it was three hundred er no five hundred acres in all."
"taking the the front grounds and the gardens and the farmland, and the woodlands."
erm there's about two hundred acres of woodlands do you see.
"and erm the farm the erm mr , timber merchant, he had bought when he came up, the whole park."
"you see, during the wartime."
"and now then, this half that the college had, do you seem he had taken most of the timber from there, do you see."
"there was a timber control and they had been there, controlling him."
"but he had cut do you see, all on the inside, and left along the roadside."
"all the trees along the roadside, and they had matured."
"and then do you see, he had taken most of the stuff from here, because he had four sawmills going do you see."
the biggest one in conway.
"and now then, all the small stuff was going do you see, for firewood, for the the  stuff ."
"for the stations, railway stations because they couldn't get any coal do you see."
and the same from  we'd been selling from there .
to make fires in the in the waiting rooms and all that do you know.
"anyway, we had cleared nearly everything, only the tops of the trees were there, left to rotten and they were been dropped on the bushes."
"and then all the undergrowth was there do you see,tangled."
"all you wanted was the rough stuff out do you see, all the timber that was good, and the bad stuff ,get it out."
"anyway, what happened do you see, the ones that he'd cut in the beginning, when he bought the place."
and he was here before he bought the place.
"the undergrowth, rhododendrons, brambles everything, had grown through the branches do you see."
so there was the  job of clearing.
and all the water courses been blocked up and then it was swampy .
"anyway, we cleared them and erm we started by the , clearing all them."
"er all that patch along the  and during nineteen i started in nineteen fifty three, and about the end of nineteen fifty four, before christmas, most of the lot that he had left behind, came down."
ornamental trees and everything mixed with them.
it was a heck of a gale.
er a southwestern gale.
and it started about midnight.
"and we were down there about half past seven in the morning, and the trees were still felling then, with the wind."
do you see.
"and them taking a lot of the trees do you see, from there, and opened the wind in do you see."
i see.
"take them i mean along the main road, he had taken the the the trees at the back of them and they had no shelter and they were down in the main road."
and all over the place.
you couldn't get in or here.
because every entrance had been blocked with trees.
big beech trees and er pine trees and everything.
"every road there was, the main drive, the drive from  the erm  what do they call it ?"
"er the lodge on the main road from caernarfon and the east lodge, to , that one was blocked as well, then three blocked."
the entrance from  in to the woodlands was blocked.
"and in the other half, of the park, them had come down do you see."
so there was no entrance there and all they could do was clear by the main lodge.
"and go through the fields, open a way through the field do you see."
from the mansion.
"and then we were clearing all the  for the week afterwards, opening places to go in and out do you see."
"now then,, being that was working on the other side, took all the trees on the main drive do you see, and he bought them and cleared them."
"and the scars are still there today, the old stumps and all that."
"anyway, that took a lot of our work do you see, back to clear them."
and selling er most of them like.
another firm from chester bought them er on the roadside.
and erm it was mostly planting then as i was saying.
and we were buying plants from er  .
"and why i went there to buy them, was because it was the same climate as , and the trees, there was no setback in the plants do you see, they were starting growing straight off cos they'd been, was the same climate."
aye.
yes.
as .
and then i had some  that was acquired from the forestry  alright again.
same climate.
"then i had some from mid wales, and they were slow in staring, because they took about twelve months to settle in there."
and get used to the climate.
most of them came on in the end.
some were dying back.
"and erm i had some beech along the roadside, main roadside."
from barrow in furness.
er and i had about twelve thousand along there.
from barrow in furness.
"i took a day to go and fetch and  mid wales, i had a lot of er of erm  erm  spruce er norway, larches and ."
the american black  they call it.
and we had thousands from there .
"but er by the time i was ready to retire, i had planted all the half park."
about two thousand acres in all.
"within about two acres, by the time i retired."
had had had you ever worked out how how how many trees that is about?
no i hadn't kept a a of the whole  like.
but we were doing on average about fourteen thousand sixteen thousand each year.
yes.
mm.
except the first two or three years i was here.
we didn't plant much then.
"cos i hadn't had the gang then do you see, there was only two of us then."
and with a clearing and we were having the help of the students .
"but there wasn't much students then, we had about four of five in the beginning."
"so i couldn't get the swing of it then do you see, for about two or three years."
or two years anyway.
"about three years, i had some more gang to help me and the students were increasing then do you see."
yes.
"but erm towards about the sixth year, we used to plant about the average of fourteen, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen thousand, aye aye."
", it wasn't a matter being that they were plants only about ."
they were only about nine to fifteen inch tall do you see.
but the  they were going up from er twelve to eighteen inches.
"an er they were coming in er the norways, they were coming in bundles of a hundred."
"the  being that they were taller, and older, they were coming in bundles of about fifty do you see."
so we had to as soon as they come we had to open a trench and heel them in do you see.
cover them up.
and make sure the frost wasn't getting at them.
make sure the wind or the frost wasn't getting at the roots.
or it killed them straight off.
and that was an extra job.
and then we could use them straight from that ditch  as we were planting do you see.
"planting about  two hundred, three hundred, four hundred a day, depend on the crowd we had, aye aye, aye."
yes.
"and erm as well as that, we were cutting young trees, what was left like on the plantation, for stakes do you see, for the farm."
and erm selling  them.
of the stakes.
"and cutting firewood, to to sell as firewood ."
"aye and making posts, gateposts for the farm and all that."
"yes, helping the the joiner with er with sawing with a big circular saw."
"that would keep him in in timber do you see, keep him going."
aye aye.
and open the the ditches.
which was that one was a heck of a job.
being there was no  erm what they call them now?
er erm the digger isn't it erm.
j c b type thing ?
"j c b, that's it."
mm.
it was all done by pick and shovel then .
aye and took more time.
"yes, but we was to get the hand of the farm fellas to do the  the erm the digging with the with the ditches and all that, yes."
yes.
"aye, well  was different, to ."
"was more flat, but  was all side."
"working on the side do you see, so all the water was running away do you see."
there was not much er ditching there .
no no.
that's all on the side.
well now then you had to get different spaces for  to here.
the same spaces wouldn't do in  that did in .
",erm because it was all side, douglas pine, douglas fir was doing better there than in ."
"was doing , but norway spruce was doing very badly, because during the war during the wintertime do you see, there was only the menai straits, there and there was not much salt in the air."
do you see.
so the wind was more fierce there off the straits.
"and , them will survive there, but during er the winter, starting october, you could see the face of the plantation of  that was facing the sea, it all scorched up towards the end of of er december."
and they would be like that scorched bread.
all the leaves getting off.
"until well in the following summer, they would recover again."
because the wind was so cold off the menai straits do you see.
it was scorching them right through.
could hardly get some to grow there.
larches were doing alright.
but the  they weren't doing very well there.
no.
"and erm  in erm , the  er  yes the  not the norway, the  er the ones that was growing in the shelter of the oak trees, they were surviving alright."
patch here and there.
"but you cut the the oak trees, down, and the ash, they would catch the wind then and scorch do you see."
aye aye.
you had to be very .
"beech, there wasn't much beech in , it was mostly round the mansion and at the back of the grounds."
that was all.
because it didn't do well there.
because beech likes a lot of lime in the ground you see.
well that's.
does it.
oak and ash doesn't like much of it.
"erm  again  beech was doing much better in  and the scotch pine, one of the best places for scotch pine and beech."
"but the oak, you didn't get the the good class of oak here."
you could get a better class of oak in .
the rocks there.
"it was all rocky and the oak well likes the rocks do you see, and they were doing better."
"they were slow in growing , but they like the rock better."
and it was a better class of oak all through.
"ash, the same again."
"if you cut the ash in , it was whitish, but if you cut it in , most of it when you cut it down, it was more like cream colour."
red and cream colour.
and erm it was a better class altogether of ash.
"and the bark on the outside was a yellowish colour, the bark of it."
"but here, it was brownish do you see, rough brownish."
aye aye.
"and er if you get yellowish in the ash bask, it's a good class of ash."
is it?
yes.
"one of the best, cos it's tough do you see."
"whereas the ones here, it's brittle."
they'll snap.
aye.
well erm   again was very good for  pine.
"a lovely class of douglas pine there, very good."
"aye, er in er two or three places right in the woodlands, in , on the slope  we had erm douglas fir there, going up two hundred and fifty, and two hundred feet tall."
good heavens.
"and the and erm diameter on  i'd been cutting a lot of them down, the diameter of them was from four foot to about six foot."
"in the butt like, aye aye."
and erm all the timber   for one.
and erm another one from er erm oh what do you call that place?
on the way to manchester.
mm.
it's beyond connor's quay that way.
they were buying a lot from .
they were two brothers.
and they reckon it was the best class of of er douglas fir they ever had.
aye aye.
", this er fellow that was  for  in conway told me we had to keep an extra erm  for  douglas fir he says."
we were .
"because it's such a good timber, he says."
aye aye.
aye it's hard to saw them.
aye aye.

right now.
"you're on various bits and bobs, and you're also on the cream."
yeah.
"if we're going to try anything else for this restless leg,."
mm.
it may be worth trying quinine which is widely used for night cramps.
mm.
and sometimes that does help.
mm.
"we don't why it works, but it certainly does."
and it's worth a go.
a.
mm.
trial of quinine and that may well help.
just a what is it?
"yeah, it's one a night."

yeah yeah.
having a.
"but not at this dose, this is a low dose."

"good, yeah."
worrying.
restless legs it's called.

good afternoon mr.
good afternoon to you.
now you're going to tell me all about your experiences in the police aren't you?
yes.
"what can you remember about your first week, or when you joined the force?"
"well i have made some notes since you can i just walk down and get them i want this to happen  i made some notes, here."
"now, now i joined the force in june nineteen twenty three at ipswich and the force strength at that time was eighty seven, which was one thousand, no one constable per thousand population."
now the training at that time was nil.
yes.
"er on appointment, like other recruits, i had to serve the first month on night duty."
"the night duty was made up of nineteen areas, they made the nineteen beats, and er i had to go with older policemen learning each of the beats."
often i had to learn two beats per night.
i was always with an older policeman.
yes.
"not often the same policeman, and i gained that experience when i found the way that they were examining property, the way they attended to accidents and street disturbances and they were pretty tough customers and i learnt a lot."
went on for a month.
"now, the first twelve months of anybody's service  is a period of probation."
yes.
"during that twelve months you get extra supervision and at the  during that period the chief constable is entitled to dispose of your service at a week's notice, but after you get over the probationary period only the watch committee could dispose of your services, the onus was on the watch committee."
"well now, during this twelve months i went out on the beats etcetera, i just merely picked it up, if i was in doubt about anything my sergeant would put me right and the atmosphere, the amount of discipline was quite severe, , i always, we had always to parade ten minutes before the hour to be acquainted with what had happened since we were last on duty."
yes.
we had no facilities for food in the police station.
"we had to take our own meals at all times, we had cups of tea we had to take to the station our own tea, sugar and milk, but there was always a large kettle during the winter months on a coal fire, and during the summer months on a gas ring."
the only thing given to us in that line was every policeman on night duty was given a pint of coffee.
oh yes.
"every policeman was given a pint mug and on night duty we were, haven't, we, each of us was given one pint of coffee."
to keep you awake?
"yes, and erm  no food whatever was obtainable in the police station."
"when we arrested people, if we arrested them and if they were in the police station for many hours, the only food that they were given was supplied by weavers restaurant, just inside  street."
"now they were provided with a meal for which the police, at that time paid sixpence, and for the sixpence for breakfast they got a thick round of bread, margarine, a piece of cheese and a mug of tea."
for sixpence.
"now they got much the same thing for the dinner, but if the prisoner had got any money of his own, and if he cared to contribute an extra sixpence  he got a hot meal at midday."
yes.
"for his tea, for the sixpence he got bread, bread, margarine and either a piece of cheese or some jam."
that's what happened.
"and erm, yes well now as i tell you we had no motor cars , we had about fifteen bicycles, which were ridden, twenty four hours a day, and after each night-duty, through riding over rough paths and etcetera they used to get punctured and damaged."
your own puncture?
"then the next morning, they were taken for repairs at a garage in hyde park corner."
"he was the man who supplied the new bicycles, raleighs, and he undertook to keep them in repair."
and they got knocked about a lot.
"well now i, bull's eye lamps, that we carried at night, they were merely paraffin oil lamps."
yes.
and during the winter months  we wore overcoats and capes.
yes.
we used to be glad to put our hands underneath the cape onto the bull's eye for a little warmth.
yes.
"well, the er night duty was difficult."
"we had a lot of walking to do, bicycles were only used by the policemen on the outskirts of the borough."
they had such a long distance that they were allowed to have a police bicycle.
"well happened, all of this happened in nineteen twenty three."
"well now in nineteen twenty six we had the general strike, and the conditions in ipswich were so violent that our borough police we couldn't cope with them, and our chief constable, he had to apply to the home office and he got permission to have men from east suffolk and west suffolk police, cambridge county police, huntingdon police sent some, and they were billeted in hotels in the town centre."
i see.
"and what these strikers were doing, they got really hand, they were overturning motor cars, what few there were."
"they were preventing millers from sending out flour from our two mills, cranfields and gibbons."
they just wouldn't let them come out with the flour.
they the the harbour master's men at the lock gates came out on strike.
there was nobody to open and close the lock gates.
yes.
"we  some special policemen to go down there and open these gates, and , you can just imagine that the policemen who came into ipswich, they were pretty rough in their dealing with the strikers."
yes.
"we in the borough, we dare not be rough because we had to remain in ipswich after the strike was over."
"and would, would the people they were being rough with know the difference?"
"yes, they  got frightened."
"there was some policemen from cambridge county and they were handpicked, two brothers came among that little group, and they each weighed over twenty stone, these two brothers, and everybody referred to them, as the two tinies."
yes.
"they were stationed at a number two police station, which was the custom house at the ipswich docks, and they spent most of their time when they were off duty just lying on stretchers  lying about, then evening time, when there was er more activity, course they came out and my word, if they told strikers they were not to go to this part of the town or road."
they didn't.
"if they were told they didn't go, they certainly got some help."
it didn't matter who it was.
"it didn't matter if they were town councillors or what, if these policemen said not this way, this way and they said no i live this way, they got a clip in the ear as quick as anything."
the ipswich borough police couldn't have done that.
yes.
"no, no."
"could, could, could the ordinary people tell the difference between the borough police."
yes.
and the county police by the uniform?
"yep no, no well  they would have different cap badges in the helmet."
and that was the only difference?
"that was the only difference, the cap badges they all differed you see."
"well now, because we were in the ipswich borough police, we were in the fortunate position of knowing that we would serve our full thirty years in ipswich, which enabled us to buy our own houses through building society."
"our children had in, they went to  schools here, and what with the friends, and neighbours and former schoolfriends we got on wonderfully well with the general public."
yes.
"but when i talk about that good feeling between police and public, it, it mattered more for the local policeman."
", i was one of several born in ipswich you see, and i had advantage over a lot of men who were released from the guards to come here."
"you see, you take mr , splendid policeman, he came straight from the guards into lodgings in ipswich."
no.
"now, when he became a detective, he hadn't got the advantage of the local knowledge that i had."
yes.
but i was in a position to help him as i was his senior.
"that's right, yes."
"and that was why he said, and he's always said, he owes me such a lot."
that's right.
"but he was such a hardworking, keen man."
yes.
i was only too pleased to help him.
help him.
oh er he was a rare worker.
yes.
"and because he was only in lodgings, he felt in his spare time that he would come with us if we were visiting lodging houses or something."
he would be glad to come with us.
i didn't like taking his spare time.
yes.
"now when i tell you about lodging houses, we had four registered lodging houses in ipswich that they had at that time."
pretty rough.
"and what exactly was a lodging house, bed and breakfast or?"
no no no just a combination sleeping and combination only.
yes.
"now, the main lodging house in ipswich was afterwards taken over by the salvation army hostel."
yes.
"but before the salvation army took it over, it was a, a borough council property, which was leased to a jewish company in london, and they used to send a manager, at this lodging house and these were then let nightly at about ten pence per night."
"i see, yes."
"and all they provided, but there was a big kitchen where they could fry their own food, make their own teas , but the the, the house proprietors, they didn't provide any food whatever."
"they were required to leave their beds and get the hostel by nine o'clock in the morning, and they were not expected to hang about any more until about five or more in the evening."
so if they hadn't got a job they got nothing.
oh no very few of them had got any work.
no.
"it, they were at these lodging houses because they hadn't got the work, nowhere else to go."
"they was only, they'd either got to pay for accommodation at a lodging house or go to the workhouse, they called them then, which is the casual ward, and at the casual ward they were required to bath on admission, which a lot of them didn't like, they were compelled to do certain work."
yes.
"and, they were often not released until they'd been at this casual ward for two days."
now some of them  used to find that irksome.
"where, where actually was the casual ward?"
well which is now where the borough general hospital is at .
was the casual ward part of the hospital?
yes.
"i see, yes."
"yes, yes that was  run separately,."
but part?
"but, but the same building."
"there was a half of the premises, and the casual wards there they, course i tell you they used to have to bath and then they used to have to do chopping wood and  sort of work like, like that."
useful work.
"yes, casual work and when some of these casuals felt that they didn't want to stop there two days, they used to tell the authorities that they had got promise of work at, at yarmouth and  and could we go soon, you see."
"and the authority was glad to get shot of them, and then the tramps, they used to go round the country, and they used to walk from one village to another and mainly, people who had arrived in ipswich casual ward, had previously been the night at stowmarket."
"they used to walk the twelve miles stowmarket to ipswich, they used to go to the police station after five o'clock, and they used to get a ticket, which they used to take the casual ward."
i see.
"now policemen, we used to have to give these blessed people these tickets, and we used to have a book, and they just merely gave name, age, occupation, which was nearly always labourer, where, and they had to tell us where they came from and where they intended going to, and more often that was from stowmarket to , or the other way round."
yes.
"and we found that over a period of, oh about a couple of months, the same people almost used to come round."
go round in a circle.
they did nothing else.
and we go got used to them.
"we didn't like them coming in the police station, they used to come into our parade room where our men were having food, and you can imagine them coming in lousy ."
"yes, as i was going to say verminous."
"yes, i mean you know they were not too welcome."
"then occasionally when we had houses broken into , if it was thought that a tramp could have been responsible, it used to be a great help if we gave out nine tickets for tramps and only eight of the nine were admitted to the casual ward, then we should clamp down on the one who failed to turn up."
"the reason some of them failed to go to the causal ward is because they used to do a little bit of begging, and if they'd got enough money they would perhaps pay to go into a common lodging house."
yes.
well now.
you were telling me about the common lodging houses.
"yes, well anyhow that, that more or less covers the early part of me being on the beat."
well then.
"you, you were saying you had to visit each of those four lodging houses."
yes.
"and i interrupted you about the casual ward, so you didn't really finish that?"
"yep, i'd finished the lodging houses, they were rough, my word they were rough, they used to get drunk and fighting, and they used to be amusing really they used to get fighting at a lodging house quite close to the dock and after when the windows was smashed, we would find that they'd been temporarily repaired with a coal sack taken from the coal yard next door, and all that sort of business, and anyhow, nothing particular the way happened until three years later when we got the general strike, and the strikers used to meet outside the labour institution headquarters in  street."
yes.
"that's where the union headquarters were you know, and because i was a local man and had worked at cranfield loading trucks at the dockside, i knew, knew a lot of the dock labourers, and they knew me, and i used to know each morning what the strikers were likely to do, where they were gonna hold up eastern counties buses i used to know all that, and the duty inspectors used to purposely send me along."
to find out.
to find out you see.
"well now it was largely, i think as a result of all that that three years later, now that was in nineteen twenty seven towards the latter of nineteen twenty seven, there was an opportunity for a detective to be appointed on a series of promotions."
"superintendent  retired, he was replaced by detective inspector ,."
yes.
"sergeant  was made inspector, was made detective sergeant and i became detective constable."
yes.
"and when the promotions were made before the watch committee, i was the last one to go in, and the chairman of the watch committee, that was john , he said to me , chief constable has recommended that you be given a trial with the detective staff."
"he said, we agree with that, he said we have decided that you will go on the detective staff on probation for a period of six months, and that means that if you like the detective staff and, and if the detective staff like you you will continue."
"well now, at the end of that six months i'd had varied success, sometimes i had poor periods when i wasn't detecting much, then i would have a little break, do better, but at the end of the six months nobody told me whether i was stopping there, but twenty years later i did go back to uniform as an inspector."
"yes, yes."
"inspector, but anyhow, now when i went on the detective staff  i'd only been on the force just over three years."
yes.
"and i, i've felt at that time and since i went on too early."
i don't really think at that time i would have had enough experience to justify going on the staff.
"i, i."
they must have thought you could do it.
"i couldn't type, we hadn't got anybody doing the office work in the detective staff, the detective sergeant used to do most of it, if he was not available i used to have to get an older detective to type a report out for me, and because i was a junior, they were not so careful in typing my reports as they were theirs."
yeah.
"and i mean  it was a difficult start, and i was in fact a junior detective for five and a half years before any alteration was made in the staff, there was no promotions or leaving as junior detective for five and a half years, i got all jobs that nobody else wanted."
"unless  unless, unless if i was in the detective office on my own and there was a decent job reported, i went straight out on it."
"sometimes i was lucky, sometimes i wasn't  , if anybody came to the enquiry after the report that the theft of a bicycle from outside the library."
yes.
"our detective office was two flights of stairs above the enquiry office, and they used to ring our office and say i'm sending a mr  upstairs, he's lost his bicycle from the library, i'm showing him up."
when he knocked on our door the older detectives wouldn't answer it.
so guess who did!
"now, my desk was not too far away, after he'd knocked twice i used to get it."
"it was a hopeless job, go to the library nobody would know what happened to bicycles, and also, we always circulated a list of stolen property to all pawnbrokers, jewellers, garage owners, and cycle agents, about every week."
"not only property stolen in ipswich, but from surrounding areas, and it was a long job."
"cycling in you know, and because nobody else wanted the job, sometimes we were supposed to share it with another, and nearly everybody else, except me, would be too big you see."
they'd all be doing something else.
or that they'd got to attend court or something.
oh yes.
so i finished up doing the lot.
"well now, although  it was not much more of a job really than an errand boy's, but as i did that for five and a half years i got to know the people at the pawnbrokers, the cycle agents i got to know them so well, i knew the staff, i got to know the people who were pawning clues and that regularly, i was getting more information every year."
so it did you a lot of good although.
"it did i, i, i was able to, i was able to pick up, and i used to clear up crimes which i know that some of the others wouldn't have cleared up at that time."
mm.
everybody liked to get in the limelight.
yes.
"if a very serious offence was reported, the detective inspector was , well he used to go  to deal with it personally because it was very important."
"if he found after two or three days that he wasn't really making much headway, he would then, after he'd left the police courts, say to me  i think you'd better go down  street or somewhere and see if you can find."
"see if you can find out who's spending money down that area, and then occasionally, not, not too often, jobs that he's fell back on and dropped, i've been able to get a little start on, and very foolishly i used to tell him sometimes of the progress i was making  that was where i made a mistake."
"that was a mistake, was it?"
"he used to say well now i'll come with you, and from that time on, after the arrests were made."
who got the limelight?
he got it.
yes.
"oh my word, and the more important the people the more he wanted it."
that's right.
"but against that, although i know that he'd took three or four very good jobs that i ought to have had, but he was a very, very good detective, a hard working inspector."
"i've taken suspects to the police station when i haven't been able to break them down, and i've told my inspector exactly what's happened, he's got the whole picture and then he's closed the door and called the man in, closed the door."
"and, if he was a man with, who had never been in trouble before, and perhaps with a young family, and through being hard-up and through illness or any other reason, he would speak to him in a fatherly manner."
yes.
"you're in trouble i want to help you, you've got children, i've got children, i know what the position is, tell me what you got into and see if i can help you out."
"they would for a start, i haven't done anything, all that sort of business, but he was extremely good and i think the reason that he'd got admissions quicker than we did, was partly by virtue of the fact that he was the boss of the department."
yes.
"that's what i really think , but he was extremely good, and i used to listen sometimes to the way that he interviewed people."
get some ideas.
"and er yes, i used to try and follow him as much as i could."
"well then , i've told you about having these trials up and down, and then, the people i've dealt with mostly of them were local criminals, i should think nearly ninety percent of crime in ipswich was committed by local people."
we didn't even take fingerprints in those days.
no.
if a stranger was picked up in ipswich.
with a long record we knew nothing about him.
"we used to send them to norwich, take them to norwich prison, with the request that they be fingerprinted."
fingerprinting section in your own ?
oh no we hadn't.
you had to take them to norwich.
"at that time we had, we didn't have any fingerprinting."
no.
"but, we knew all our locals you see, we knew all their histories."
yes.
"but when a stranger was picked up for house breaking or shop breaking or something, a complete stranger, we used to send them to norwich  pending further enquiries, and with a request that they be fingerprinted, and they used to fingerprint, send to scotland yard, we used to then get the record if they had a record with a photograph, and all their previous convictions."
we hadn't even got a photographer.
oh dear.
"you knew, you knew your local criminals, but you haven't got any pictures of them."
"no we hadn't, we hadn't got a photographer."
"so when scotland yard sent us photographs of criminals that we were dealing with, we used to have to take this descriptive form and photograph to walters the photographers in  plane, and he charged sixpence to copy the photograph."
goodness.
it doesn't seem believable.
it doesn't does it?
"but i mean you, you just imagine, we've got no cars, no photographer,."
no.
"and er when i tell you that i went to the detective staff in nineteen twenty seven, then we started with our first mobile help."
"the watch committee agreed that we should have, not we, the force, should have a motorbike combination."
"now mr  he is the garage proprietor, who used to supply the bicycles, he supplied the motorcycle and sidecar, that was a start."
"the watch committee then, this was what, round about nineteen thirty perhaps, then agreed that we should have a police car."
"car was bought, that was kept at  garage, which was about quarter of a mile distance from the police station, kept in the garage."
who drove it?
there were only two policemen allowed to drive it.
police constable george  and p c jack .
"and they, they had had some experience or were they engineers or something."
"oh they had i must tell you at the time that we hadn't got a car , on the occasion of a royal visit, or some very important action being taken, my chief constable used to hire a chauffeur driven car from mr  of  lane in ipswich."
oh yes.
he was a very smart man.
"and he always provided a very smart car, and the first policeman to drive the police car was his own chauffeur, who left him and joined the police force."
"i see, well, well."
"er his former chauffeur joined the force, p c , he was in, he drove our first police car, well which he shared with p c , then when our cars got to number two, three , he eventually came up, he retired as inspector, traffic inspector."
traffic division.
"he, he simply came up  with the number of cars."
"traffic division, yes."
yeah.
yeah.
"and er  what was i going to tell you, i told you about , i talked about we had nine pawnbroker's shops, i didn't did i, but that we did have nine pawnbroker shops in ipswich."
there were six lodging houses were there?
"yes, that's the lodging houses."
means of communication.
oh not very good.
not very good .
no walkie-talkies.
"no, no nothing like that ."
there were very few places in the town where we could use telephones especially at night.
"very difficult indeed, you didn't like calling up people at a private house and ask if we could use the phone."
what about post offices?
"so what they did eventually, they put sort of call boxes occasionally, in different parts of the borough so during the night you could ring up the station."
you could ring up the station.
yes.
"now i, i know on periods of night duty we had two fixed points."
there was always a policeman on the .
yes.
"and that was quite a good idea, because late at night following wedding parties and other , if anybody was behaving in an disorderly manner and people were returning home, they would always tell the policeman that they saw that a rowdy crowd were coming along."
further down the road.
but they wouldn't walk a few yards into the police station and tell anybody.
no.
"but they wouldn't take that trouble, but they'd always speak to the uniform policemen, if or if they heard anyone smashing glass, but they wouldn't go their way."
"no, i understand."
"but the relationship was extremely good, i think that you might say that for many years in my service, it was almost a case of the law abiding citizens in ipswich coping with the wrongdoers."
we got plenty of help .
i suppose that's the best way really.
"oh, we got plenty of help, and , it's always been said that you don't reveal a man's past until he's been found guilty of an offence, but our magistrates were all local shopkeepers you know."
know them .
"and they used to know the, the wrongdoers, and when allegations were made about any violence on the police, they would know the policeman pretty well, and more often than not they could tell whether a policeman might be of the type who might provoke anybody, they knew the policeman very well indeed, and my word if the policeman was assaulted in my early days, he'd got to have a jolly good excuse not to be sent to prison."
yes.
"the magistrates, they, if they were satisfied that it was, i don't sound very."
"no, no,."
"clip of the ear, nothing like that, but if  if you'd got a black eye."
yes.
"and you'd got a little bit of plaster you, you could show the court the next morning, he was going to prison."
the magistrates would tell you that they were they were going to do their utmost to to support the police at all times.
yes.
"and,i must get back now to."
communication.
"communication yes, we used to have the difficulty, and we used to rely on the odd person, railway people, drivers and their guards, they used to be knocked up during the night for early duty, by call boys, we used to make use of them if we wanted a message sent anywhere."
"you know, anyhow."
"yes, yes."
"but er we, we had quite a difficulty, very, very difficult, we used to have to walk a long way before we could get to a telephone."
"now, you all had whistles, did you use those much?"
"oh we had whistles, and strangely enough, very seldom did we use them, simply because there were other traffic about that time  if you were a long way away, er you might be nearly to , if you blew your whistle, there were nobody to hear you, i mean people in houses, and they were only few and far between."
"i, i, i don't hardly think that i can remember blowing a whistle."
i don't really.
yes.
"we, have i told you about the policeman who was fixed permanently at the ?"
yes.
the town centre.
"there was also a policemen all night on  bridge, all night."
"he was relieved, , by the policemen from the neighbouring beats."
was that the docks?
"yes, that faced the dock, and fire or any emergency, he used to always be there and he'd be able to see it."
watching the dock there'd be a policeman on patrol at the dock.
yes.
but he would be fixed at the bridge.
"and, people from the town centre who were going home to stoke had to go over the bridge."
yes.
and the if there was a street disturbance or a quarrel in the house everybody used to come to stoke bridge for the policeman.
yes.
"and er, we used to get all sorts of calls."
supposing he got called his post would there be somebody ready to take his place?
"no, no, if you got called away  there wouldn't be anybody to take over until the next relief  if, if the man was coming up the dock with two  well you wouldn't be able to get him either."
no.
"but if he was to come on at three o'clock in the morning, the other man called away wouldn't be replaced."
no.
"and er you used to get recalled for all sorts of things, often a family disturbances."
yes.
"i was called away one morning,somebody came along to me and said will you come along to  street, there's a chap playing up, old harry, he's trying to build a shed or something and it's two o'clock in the morning, none of us can sleep, do come me."
"well, i went along to  street and this chap was hammering away, and the people were swearing from windows, and i realized the chap was mental."
oh.
"oh, i knew that that night i was in a very difficult position, if he had been on the public highway i could have taken him to the police station and taken him."
"i could have taken him if he's on the public highway, i could have taken him to the police station."
but not in his own garden.
"no, and i had i er  i had tried to appeal to him to be quiet, he said well i've got to build this shed, i said well it don't have to be during the night when other people are trying to sleep, he said well that's them, and he started hammering again, while i was talking to him, and then i kept on and on and eventually, i think while i was talking to him i'd kept him quiet while i was talking to him."
mm.
and then i told.
"told his wife to get the doctor, and that sort of business in, but er  imagine a man knocking up his shed during the night."
he must have thought he was noah.
no.
on another occasion.
what would you have done with him if you had been able to arrest him?
"as he was mental, i mean would you have taken him to a hospital or the station?"
"no, no, no, take him to the police station."
yes.
and then get your police sergeant.
"i see yes, mm."
and if he come along he would want to know who the man's doctor was.
yes.
"so he got his history, and then a magistrate can certify him and he can be handed over to er what is now st clements hospital."
"they used to call it the asylum, years ago."
"yes, yes."
but they changed the name of it.
"well then  while i was serving as a detective, you can just imagine i made plenty of arrests, and i got along reasonably well with most people, but there was one man i hated  yes i hated him, i, i'd only been a detective i should think for a period of about, oh five or six months, and a man, he called on the reverend  who was the, the vicar of st. mary where."
"and this man said that he was a lay reader, and that he'd retired, he'd come back from australia, and he though that he would like to help out in the parish."
"reverend  thought oh yes he'd be very very glad of you, so he said i'd be prepared to visit the sick, i'd do anything like that and he did in fact start doing some visiting, and among other people that he called upon was a person living in  road, not very far really from where i'd been born and i knew the area well."
yes.
now he called at this house and said that he was er visiting for.
for the church.
"and while he was talking to the woman he saw in the hall an elderly woman, and he said to the woman at the door, is that your mother, she said oh yes she's with me now, she used to live at woodbridge."
he said well did she get the er widow's loaf?
"she said you never get anything here, she said she did get the widow's loaf once when she was at woodbridge, he said she'll have the widow's loaf now."
"and he went on just across the road to  road co-op and he bought a small loaf of bread which at that time would be about tuppence, and gave the old lady this small loaf   about ten days afterwards he called again, he said, he said i've come to see you again, now are you alright , he said i've done a foolish thing this morning, he said i'm responsible for the flowers, altar flowers, he said and i've left my wallet at my lodgings, and my landlady has gone down to  for the day."
he said.
con man.
"he said i'm properly on the spot, so he, so the woman volunteered, she said well can i help you, i've got my fortnight's rent money here, so she let him have the rent money."
"course i don't have to tell you any more, she didn't see him no more."
"he then went and called on a mrs  who'd got a confectionery shop, corner of  road and  road and a hard luck story there, he got a few pound for doing out the sacrament, he got some money from her."
"and then when they eventually complained, when other people were involved, complained, reverend  he hadn't seen this chap either."
"his name was , but i found he'd been lodging in a house in  road close to the railway station."
yes.
"and when i saw the landlady there she said that she did have a mr  there but he'd left a few days ago, didn't know where he'd got to."
"i said well now can i see his room, she said well really i've cleared the room since he's gone, but i found some papers in the room, which indicated that he was a convict on licence."
"yes, yes."
"well that gave me a start , so immediately i got a warrant out, and he, some while afterwards he was picked up in london."
"well they, i had to go to  road police station, london, it was quite good, the detective took, took me around that little area and er then when i got ready to collect  to take him to liverpool street station, i saw him for the first time, man about sixty one and he'd got two suitcases, one lighter than the other, and while i was signing for him and his property i said to him, you take that light one and i'll take the bigger one with the view to getting on the bus to get to liverpool street but the inspector there was very good, he said i'm not going to oh  and i said to  you take the light case i'll take the high one, he said i can't carry anything, i got a rupture."
ooh.
the inspector said i'm not going to allow you to leave here with a prisoner and those two cases.
"yes, with both hands occupied what could you do?"
"yes, so he then called in a constable, who was living in a section house nearby."
"he said, now go to go to your section house get a sports jacket or something, and go with this police officer, he said i'll get a police van, he said go with this police officer to liverpool street station, he said and take charge of this prisoner while he gets a ticket, for ipswich."
"very wise, he might have disappeared."
"he he said get that, he said and go with him onto the train and see him safely in the compartment, ascertain the time of arrival in ipswich, and go and telephone ipswich police telling them that they were to meet this on arrival at ipswich, and i thought that our chief constable really."
"ah, here he is."
this morning??
the quicker these kids get back to school.
is it them that's causing it?
oh.
it's always the same.
always the same.
every.
i'm just off for my  my line doctor.

aye.
that  i feel great.
i've stopped smoking now for four month.
four months?
very good.
"the very first spending stacks of money now,?"
i've not got any now.
"cos when you smoke you kept your money for your fags, but if you don't smoke you don't need to keep it."
i thought you'd have been buying an oil well or something like that .
"i know, i didn't realize,."
my two brothers are off on holiday now for ten days .
aye.
"there's a lot of folk given up, just in the past year."
it's terrible.
"i mean that that  addicted to it, i was like a heroin addict, you know?"
oh aye.
"oh aye, i ."
and all these years they spend .
you.
i know.
you telling me to stop smoking for.
that's right.
that's right.
"you see, they tell you to stop smoking."
the day it happened the day you got this.
aye.
"heart attack,that was it."
well what really set my mind was when i lost my sister and my brother.
mm.
"cathy and hughie like, in two."
yeah.
months  smoking.
that's right.
that's right.
"i mean we've got a friend and  she used to smoke sixty a day, and she never."
"even talked about stopping, till her pal, into hospital, a a bypass operation."
and that was it.
enough.
tt!
that was it.
no chance.
i've been off for three or four time before  for long  a few years and.
aye.
och aye.
i know but.
back to it.
"they go back to it, this is the thing."
and it frightens me seeing the youngsters coming out  carrying .
that's right.
"and , you know?."
"a couple of youngsters yesterday, seven year old, eight year olds at the very most, they have one of these gas lighters, up round the back of the  ."
it's nobody could see them.
"i know, you can't, you can't  ."
can't tell them.
tell mine.
right oh.
"last week, week before, i was told a chest infection and throat infection and well i just don't feel no better."
coughing all the while.
i've also been sick but er.
yeah.
i i haven't been sick for er about a week.
right.
now.
right.
"you've just finished a course of antibiotics, haven't you?"
yes.
and that's fine and before that er yeah.
.
do you smoke ?
do you smoke?
no.
"right, okay and nothing coming up?"
"no i, i, i get there every now and then and heave, and that."
yeah.
makes me feel even worse.
yeah.
like cos i.
"yeah, what job do you do?"
a miner.
"okay, open wide for me."
stick your tongue out.
say ah.
ah.
"yeah, it looks pretty good down there, okay, well let's have a listen to your chest."
"yeah, they'll be fine, bit cool."
nice deep breath.
mm.
keep breathing for me.
very deep breaths out.
well.
how would you feel if er if i said describe how you feel on a scale of one to ten?
"er right now i'm two one, two or lower."
"yeah, do you get."
feel really low and breath easily.
yeah.
are you getting hot sweats?
"yeah, do now and then, yeah."
have you been anywhere exotic on holiday in the past three months?
no.
past year?
no.
and conditions down the pits?
hot.
.
damp?
water?
"well our pits there's a lot of water but it's, it's mostly body sweat and i do get some water off a, a machine that i drive."
yeah.
"but er it's, it is very hot."
it's no  a hundred degrees .
humid.
"yeah, okay."
previous to this you've been fit and well?
cos we've.
"yeah, yeah."
hardly seen you .
no.
okay.
you've got a nasty chest infection.
"down here, the whole of the left side on the back."
are you getting any.
chest pain?
"i have been on, you know with."
yeah.
the breathing?
i couldn't.
yeah.
you know when.
yeah.
"i, i wanted to cough and i couldn't."
yeah.
because i couldn't take a.
okay.
big breath.
right.
every time i took a big breath i were getting short pains all down this side?
yeah.
"well it, it, not yesterday, the day before, i got them under my right shoulder blade,."
yeah.
"like, when i took a big breath it were."
"right, okay."
we erm probably ought to do some blood tests too.
yeah.
"and a chest x-ray, and some antibiotics."
are you not fit for work?
well i should have started back yesterday.
no.
"but,."
so you're not fit for work.
you're not fit for work.
don't often tell people they're not fit.
"i normally say how do you feel, but not in your case,."
"i was worried about the, the work i, i couldn't get in to see you until today."
yeah.
and i should have started back yesterday like.
.
do you think you can roll your sleeve up?
have you had blood taken before?
"i think so yeah, but a while ago."
right.
"which sleeve, left or right."
whichever you've got good veins in really.
just er.
"has anyone else been unwell with anything similar that you're aware of,?"
"my son was about three week ago but  it it wasn't as bad as this, he got a bad cough and."
yeah.
things like but he wasn't.
you're not taking any pills and tablets are you?
no.
only i have had those what the.
"yeah,."
they obviously haven't worked.
er i keep getting a lot of headaches and i think it's with the hacking and coughing i'm doing.
i should think so.
and i just er you know i have paracetamol or aspirin.
"okay,one two three."
"i'm sure you've got one of these really strange chest infections, and these are the ones that tend to hit young, healthy, fit, young adults."
"yeah well  it's rare for me to come to the doctor's but last three week i've been here like every week, kind of thing."
mm.
well  they're not common but every now and again we see someone who looks like they've got a straightforward problem that doesn't get better.
yeah.
"and it's the not, do you want to press ?"
it tends to be the.
the not getting better with normal things that gives it away.
yeah.
"and i'm sure when we do these blood tests  we'll find that things are not altogether normal, now sometimes it's actually the way you respond to treatment that gives it away."
mm.
doing blood tests but er we're going to treat you somewhat differently.
now we'll probably need to repeat some of these in about ten to fourteen days.
the lab really want two samples.
i'm going to ask them to run them today.
"to, well to run them now, they'll still take a week to come back, they do run them today,."
"that's okay, isn't it?"
yeah.
okay.
"the other thing you need is a chest x-ray, and that's very important er to see exactly what degree of trouble is going on."
because there's an awful lot of rubbish to hear rattling around.
"we'll find there's a, quite a lot to see on a film."
it's  isn't it?
"yes, that's right."
"now if you nip down to the victoria hospital, if you know where that is in mansfield?"
"yeah, the one."
it's called mansfield community.
"yeah i know which one you mean, yeah."
"er you can go to the x-ray department there any day monday to friday, any time between nine and four thirty, so it's basically all day every day."
okay?
"if you get yourself down there, they'll do a chest x-ray, you don't need an appointment, there should be minimal waiting time, in and out."
okay?
"have i go that, have i to hang about for the the the."
"no they, they send it."
they'll sort it all out.
they send the report to me.
"okay, yeah."
okay.
now  it's important that we review you.
you do need to be seen next week really.
"ah unfortunately i'm not here to follow you up cos i'm actually away next week, sorry about that."
"but you really do need to be seen next week to have a look at the initial blood results, the chest x-ray, more importantly, how are you getting on."
that's more important.
"now this stuff is two a day, as a single daily dose, on an empty stomach, okay?"
"for, i think we'd probably better keep you going for, how about six hmm  for five days, that's actually quite a long course for this stuff cos it lasts an awful long time in the body."
"so that's a, these are a pretty hefty dose of antibiotics."
yeah.
"two a, a day as a single dose, strictly on an empty stomach so half an hour to an hour before food."
yes okay.
"for five days, boom boom boom boom boom."
it's completely different from what you've had before.
"er if it upsets your tummy let us know, but that's actually very uncommon."
"this is the stuff i used for my sinusitis, it's wonderful."
okay?
it's not quite like domestos by mouth but it's not far short.
"if the blood tests show anything specific that we need to get back to you on, we will contact you directly."
are you on the phone?
yes.
"lovely, okay, and you need a note."
"i'm gonna put two weeks cos i'm sure you're not going to be fit you won't feel fit,."
"okay,."
"to go back that quickly, your chest is clearing rapidly."
i'll put atypical chest infection.
we may be able to actually narrow it down to a particular bug and that's what these are for.
yeah.
but er we will see.
okay?
thank you very much.
"so it's very important we get you seen next week, you feel better."
"er note, chest x-ray."
"do you want me to make an appointment next week, while i'm here?"
"blood yes you'll have to see one of either doctor  or doctor  i'm afraid but er if i, if i write everything down they'll know exactly where we are and what's going on."
okey-doke?
thank you.
"not , take care of yourself."
"plenty to drink, ordinary wise."
i would avoid alcohol.
"they don't actually  antibiotics, it'll probably make you feel more knackered than you already are."
yeah.
thanks.
.
right.
"right, thank you very much then."
"okay, take care of yourself."
"right, cheers."
bye now.
hello doctor.

"because it's got the, it's the one with the fewest er  detergents,."

it's the safest one of the lot.
"that, or the next best is er simple soap shampoo."
"aye, that's right, aye."
these two are the best.
that's the best to use?
they're the safest to use.
that's good that's fine.
"and if you do that,."
it should clear up.
and you use this stuff for about a month  use this  stuff is quite soft.
aha.
"you don't need a lot of it,."
it's almost  almost as soft as this.

aha.
er that that  isn't.
"this is highly perfumed, but you really  see that?"
"some like that, and just rub it in."
aye.
just like that.
"see a wee drop like that'll cover that,."

"oh, yes."
right.
there's a few times so i'll give you that four.
is that?
do you want to see him again?
aye.
that's fine.
right.
okay.
yeah.
we stayed in that house till i were eight year old and then we were  went where i lived the rest of my time and that would have been from nineteen twenty to oh a couple of year ago.
what was it like on wyre then was it very different?
oh entirely different from now.
the pier and the hydro and the telephone made a big difference to it.
but erm other  eighteen inches or two foot to a jetty to land it.
all the feeding stuff and there were a pile of feeding stuff then for the hens were all  and cattle were fed and all the feeding stuff had to be imported.
and sometimes it landed in a gay sorry mess and it really wouldn't there just a couple of feet a couple of stones high just  the height of the jetty.
and we've had many a soaking landing the stuff.
steamer sometimes anchored off and sometimes it didn't anchor there was too much wind i guess the anchor didn't hold too well when it was a rough day.
how often did you get the steamer?
oh it varied .
in the winter time they'd come out on a monday morning and came back on tuesday from kirkwall.
and then the summer time they come out on a monday morning and gone back at on monday night.
that was the  the first one i can remember.
the shipping company supplied the boat for bringing the goods ashore.
there's usually a old salmon coble they'd pick up from down the coast somewhere.
very flat on the bottom and turned the bow and that's what the salmon fishers used in the in the rivers for pulling their nets in and fishing salmon on the .
why choose one of the  was it cos they were suitable or cheaper?
well they were suitable and  cheaper  they were too blooming cheap for the  they were usually condemned by the time we got them.
they lashed alongside and they lowered the stuff right onto the onto the coble to start with we rowed it ashore with a couple or oars or maybe four oars and took off the cattle and that the same way just.
or they put a sling round them or made a canvass and two supports on the side of it and the sling to be too hard on the cattle's sides.
like a sort of hammock .
and er put that on and tied them back and front and up on them tied them to the sides of the coble and and usually towed it with another rowing boat.
it was all done by oars then.
were the cattle and all ?
oh they were not too bad for that we never had any real  disaster .
just had one jumped over the side from us once and swamp ashore again and we caught it on the on the land again and put it away.
i'm  having to swim them off the steamer and tow them in a dinghy to get our  put the slings on them before we left the beach and just pushed them into the water and towed them off and hook the hook the  into the sling and up them to give them a good wash before they went to kirkwall.
it's funny how an animal like a cow or a horse would swim you would think it would be.
well they can they can swim like fish.
for i remember us doing a flipping er a family came to wyre once and we were on the same old coble we were er doing the flipping and we thought we had nothing to do but take the rope off their heads and push them over the side of the coble onto the side of the small jetty.
and going up the jetty they went down and they were going to go right back to rousay again.
and another instance of that was well this was not so long ago when we had a loan of a barge from  just a mini landing craft sort of thing where the front of it folded down.
"so i flipped some cattle from the farm of  and  right between egilsay and rousay just a short distance, oh maybe a quarter of a miles or thereby, and oh did the shipping perfectly well and and went home and by the time i got home the message had arrived back before me that the there were two old cattle among the younger ones that the fellow had put there just to feed up and the last we saw of them was going up over the island and that was okay we thought everything was okay."
so the message was that the two old cattle was back in rousay.
they swam that strong current you know and landed back on rousay again.
just imagine it.
you'd think it would be totally alien for them to go in the water like that.
i know.
but they will do it.
were the cattle in rousay and wyre and egilsay were they used to that kind of thing?
oh no really no.
well you see egilsay and rousay had piers that they could land at and they were never used to be in the water.
but i've seen in my time  coble to ship cattle with to swim them off.
at it was on a nice day it was .
i suppose when they got in the water they enjoyed the dip.
what about other animals?
sheep can be very skittish and excitable .
oh oh  oh yes.
there's sometimes there's a job to handle them.
i've seen them taken to the sea too and er have a job to round them up.
and the horses well they they're the worst to ship some were really bad and they had to be severely tied.
some use to keep pigs too but not very many in wyre.
we had a job to handle them.
the screams on them more than enough.
what happened in in the depth of winter when it was really bad and stormy as far as supplies and things went?
oh it could be stormy right enough but well the steamer might call at rousay at that time and they would land the goods in rousay the perishables for wyre and when the weather abated we would get it from there.
it was a half a mile of water to cross.
what happened with perishables because you said there was no power no electricity no fridges no freezers nothing .
nothing no i've seen the bread coming out on a monday morning warm and landed at  from the big houses and that was before the days of the cooling of the bread.
they have coolers now  to take the steam them.
and the boxes would even be warm when they landed at wyre down in the hold of the steamer.
but the bread soon turned green in this time of year and there was quite a lot of penicillin about hence..
did folks still have girdles then or was that going out?
oh yes i guess they'd girdles oh i suppose when the hens failed the girdles were possibly thrown out.
but the hens when  was the hurricane there about finished them.
about at their height about the hurricane time and was it fifty one i think.
what was it like?
oh terrible.
i thought i would never seen the next day.
the stacks were just simply not there.
it just lifted the roofing from the base of the stack and hen houses just scattered all over the place.
just hens laying here there and everywhere.
i remember me gathering the hens up that night late oh about ten or eleven o'clock at night and  we had our own power you see by that time.
just our own lighting plant and the hens would even come out and meet you in the dark they knew knew you were coming.
and they'd come along cattle  there just contented as could be and then they got their supper and we'd give them a wee while of light still to eat their supper.
and the first was a twelve volt  but then we came to a hundred and ten so i just strung it down along the two top wires of the fence and they were live and oh there were about six or nine hen houses attached to the fence with those wires for electricity.
but the next morning there was nothing left.
on this night you said you'd gone up to feed them?
yes.
oh well i gave them and went home and went to bed.
and the wind got up in the night and pretty strong and we had a hut a twenty by twenty five foot fourteen eighteen war hut in the middle of a square and there was a shop and a storeroom besides.
and there was nothing left but the base of that.
whole thing just went like a matchbox.
and i got up and i was gonna tie her up like but and by gosh i thought i'd better make for the door again.
and there was a lot of space between the hut and the door and the wind took me and flung me right up against the  tank and i went down to the ground and crawled on me hands and knees.
i didn't go out again.
i remember before that the wind changed pretty suddenly from southwest to nearer west i think and i'd made a new hen house i thought indestructible.
and we had sixty pullets at the point of lay in this house to be moved out from the house to a field.
and we were standing on the end of the house and i thought i had nothing to tie that down with but there were concrete blocks there i had a pile of those in the corner and well it took the whole blooming thing.
and minced the hens up with the blocks.
oh  it was terrible.
and it let an old house alongside  with nothing in it and hardly a door on it and that stood right alongside of that one and it must have been like a comb it just must have gone in strips the gale for that house was now twelve foot the other one.
and why did that one stand and the blocks in in this one and the hens and everything.
so that was disaster.
were you married then?
mhm mhm.
did you have a young family ?
yes and we took the whole thing down to the kitchen for the upstairs rooms were just going like this.
and when we were down in the kitchen the partition between the butt and the bairn as they called it was going like that inside of the house in the gale.
and it ripped about a quarter of the roof off before it finished and the slates but er  still good.
oh it lifted huge stones you know it it was incredible.
were the bairns frightened?
well some of them i suppose slept over it.
what?
yes.
but i certainly did not.
and when it daylight came the next day next morning you could hardly believe it you could hardly see rousay for the foam that the gale kick up like a thick fog.
the  had risen in the air and i never want to see the like again.
it must have done an awful lot of damage everywhere else too.
oh it did that .
and some of that hen houses blew right on the sea.
not our our owns but erm other people and they could see them the next day when the steamers went to the north isles for the er the cockerels or the hens sitting on the top of them.
and they could do nothing to save them.
did the steamers go the next day?
well yeah the wind fell but i'm not really sure whether they went the next day or the day after that i can't remember.
oh it took some sorting out on the next morning.
and you see all the crop had vanished over the night.
and they had to import hay and straw and goodness knows what.
did the council have to set up some sort of emergency system?
er yes i think they did but er we reckoned we lost about eight hundred and fifty pounds worth of gear.
fifty or sixty pound worth of that but which was nothing.
were folk insured for that kind of thing then or.
well no really some of them were not.
what about livestock would they have been in at that time of year?
oh yes.
oh some of the roofs and that were peeled off no bother.
was there any loss of life?
no funny to say.
had it been in the day time i'm sure there would have been lives lost for they wouldn't have stayed in to seen their stuff go under.
going for the wind.
"thing about boats you know you were speaking about the steamer coming back and forth to wyre, but what kind of a boat service was there local boat service."
cos if the steamer only came once a week that wouldn't have been enough.
oh that was about the lot er we had.
if you wanted to go to kirkwall you had to cross to the rousay pier and then either hire a car or walk to  and get across with tom .
erm that was in the early days charley  and tom  did the crossing there for the mails and early in nineteen fifty one no fifty five that we took over the mails.
and we before that we made quite a few runs to kirkwall with a  that was a small one that we had and erm you had to get the bus from evie to kirkwall and back the same way.
back the back to what you would call the  sea crossing er to  and get the rousay pier then and get a dinghy or something and row across to wyre.
did you start doing a passenger service when you got the mail contract or did you to the mail just on its own first or did you.
no we did we did passengers before the mails.
we used to run direct to kirkwall via  and erm it was then that the post office caught hold of us and wanted us to take on the mails.
so.
how did you work that was it er round like egilsay  or did you.
no no the first mail run we had was just merely from  to rousay to collect the rousay  mails and dump them at the rousay pier and they were sorted in rousay for egilsay and wyre besides that.
and as we were coming home from rousay pier we met the wyre post boat coming across for the mails that we already had dumped in rousay.
and egilsay crossed to  the school just there yes .
er they crossed there to  for the mails for years and years.
and.
you said you met the wyre post boat coming back so you didn't.
as we went back to wyre home to wyre we could meet the wyre post boat coming across for the mails that we put to rousay.
they had to go and collect the mails.
well you see they had the mail er contract on wyre long before we start.
but it finally ended up that we had the whole thing rousay egilsay and wyre.
so did you do a passenger service direct to kirkwall calling at egilsay and rousay?
er yes just er no really a service it was more hires than anything else.
just er for the  business.
oh so the passenger service it it wasn't actually a a daily passenger service like it is now then?
oh no no no.
well we went every day on about the mail so it was a passenger service that really started off in nineteen fifty five but we  bought maybe in nineteen fifty three or fifty four.
we had to run direct to kirkwall quite a lot then.
when did the bus service start to  then?
oh it was a while after we start.
actually it not that long ago.
but a few years now.
well what did folk do when they got to  then?
oh well bob  had a mini bus that he went with and picked up the passengers.
and he died and i think.
there was no bus then?
no.
they only thing they could do was to go walk up to  walk up a road to  and contact the evie bus but it didn't come down along  for years and years.
and then er tom  retired and he used to run the bus long after we start the mails and then he retired and er the  bus service to come down along  and pick up the passengers and that was how it start.
there was tom  running a passenger service at the same time as you were doing the mail?
mhm and he lost the mails in nineteen fifty five.
he packed up the mails and er tackled the  to have a go.
and we were not too keen on it at that time but had been .
so are there two boats going every day then?
well yes there would nearly two going every day indeed.
did you take supplies and things then?
mhm.
i took our tin of bread across for donkey's years.
what happened in the days before freezers i mean well like going back to this you know when folk didn't have power.
things wouldn't have kept what you would have had a totally different kind of eating habits?
well i suppose more salted meat i mean more home home butching and erm making bread i suppose or the womenfolk were likely baking every day.
it must be totally different now i i know that in places like hoy that just used the freezers all the time.
yes mhm.
even with our  daily transport.
mhm.
oh yes we yeah we use a freezer too.
we took in  and for  and still use it.
i thought plenty believe in fresh meat and that.
i suppose fresh meat is better but you're only suppose to keep a certain time anyway even in the freezer.
what about fishing?
"when you were younger in wyre, how did folk make a living?"
oh plenty of porridge and  milk and  er oh there was no much money to be made i mean and there was bigger population then than what it is now.
"you said about the hens making a lot, how did how did they work that as an industry with the eggs and things how did they collect and work?"
we had a oh  nearly a dozen cases of eggs  dozen sometimes for some farms.
and it was a big business and tons of feeding stuff.
for every ton of feeding stuff then there maybe a hundredweight now coming ashore.
it was.
what happened?
well imported eggs i suppose.
irish eggs and goodness knows whatnot.
oh and there's factory farming this er  big business.
i guess it flawed the lot of it.
you could always tell a deep litter egg.
oh absolutely.
it stank and it was dark orange.
yes.
you could tell a  broiler what they call them er fowls.
that was absolutely white compared with a fully range fowl.
i mean that's the meat.
oh that's just no so good.
there must have been a big business the deep litter started cos i can remember the farm next door to us working a deep litter.
mhm.
and they had hundreds and hundreds of hens in deep litter and they seemed to be making a lot of money it.
oh they would yes.
oh they and i guess it set a few farmers on his feet.
but it didn't last.
what happened with the egg packing station?
oh well it just packed up you know no eggs and that was that.
there were two packing stations at one time.
one down at  here and er where was the other one or the  down the road here.
that was a fairly big one and i think there may have been one at stromness too.
oh it had washing machines and goodness knows whatnot.
what's.
automatic feeders and such likes.
what sort of prices did folk get for eggs then?
oh i can't remember that.
mm.
was it the the women's business really?
well a point indeed but er the men would er help out i doubt.
i always seem to recall the women their elbows in freezing cold water washing.
washing eggs?
mhm.
oh yes.
and plenty got this egg wash  you see.
and just filled a net basket of eggs and put it down in the in the water and the water flowed through it .
possibly possibly with a pump i don't know.
but it would be better if it did not need washing.
the egg was actually the eggs would keep better  washed.
oh why's that then?
well i think it broke the seal in the wash  and er which was good get them as they were laid they were okay.
keep the nests clean but that was no good to do either so.
sometimes the hens would start eating them and break the eggs oh what a mess.
when they changed the deep litter did it erm i've heard folks say that it actually affected the hens that they that they went cannibal and.
oh yes oh they would do that .
they started pecking and it was a job to get them stopped.
yes it's funny to think of hens having feelings but i suppose being cooped up like that it did affect them.
oh aye it must have done mhm.
see they got on the lights so long of the day in the winter time and made them lay just like it'd been summer.
well that was the idea of the.
mhm.
deep litter.
mhm mhm.
old one old ones just used which was at the bulb in every hen house and it was free range and i think there was nothing better than that.
and they would lay just when and collect them eggs that night afore the gale.
it was i just heard about.
ah.
i wish i.
hello!
i wish i could do that.
oh.
"well, what can i do for you today, agnes?"
i'll tell you.
"i don't know if it's old age or not, oh, it's getting worse."
"i've been, i can't even fasten my bra at the back."
bad as that?
that's .
"actually i've got, i've got er oruval."
and i take that for that sciatica.
mhm.
mm.
is that good for that?
no?
no.
"see i didn't, i, i, and he gave me, i was here, oh i don't know if it was about a fortnight ago i was here."
anyway i wasn't well.
it.
mhm.
was my ear.
"was it you i no it wasn't you i seen about my ear, was it?"
fortnight ago?
"see i no, a fortnight, how long ago was it ?"
i saw you about nearly five weeks ago.
in fact more than that.
no.
no it was after that.
it was after that i seen somebody.
"it was doctor, was it doctor ?"
.
aye.
"i just took whoever i could, cos i said i'll take er and it was doctor."
right.
and er it was my ear.
aha.
"and, and this, i er i just wasn't well."
i said.
right.
i don't know.
do you think it's the change of life that's  me?
no!
because i just don't keep well.
er.
and i'm taking  right.
"and they're coming  i don't think i'm taking for a couple of months, and then i take them every fortnight."
mhm.
and they're kind of lasting.
if you know what i mean.
they're do you think that is?
it's going away?
right.
"that, that could that could be it disappearing."
hopefully it is.
"but as i say, i've er but somebody says to me, they've here i go again, talking about what everybody says they've got."
"they said they've got that brufen, for this?"
this  arm.
no.
no.
is that not for that either?
"no that's, that's all, that's for arthritis."
is it?
that's a neuralgia.
that's a neuralgia.
"could it, do you."
pain you've got .
do you think that.
mhm.
do you think it's.
yeah.
a neuralgia pain?
"that's a neuralgia pain you've got, that's  brufen wouldn't make much difference to that agnes."
still in ?
"yeah,."
"er, oh, it's, see actually i wondered if it was a frozen shoulder?"
"i thought that if, you know how sometimes."
no no.
"you, see when i, i cannae turn,."
that's.
"see when i go i, i cannae."
you wouldn't be able to do that if you had a frozen shoulder.
wouldn't i?
no.
"i can, i can actually get it to there, but see when i."
"aye, well, if you had a frozen shoulder you wouldn't get it past there."
"well, i can get it past there but i couldn't lift it up."
that's right.
there's no way i can lift it up.
"no, that's."
"now this one, now, i can go like that."
mhm.
that's right.
"you know, this one's all."
that's right.
and it seems to be more in this just one place.
mhm.?
oh.
see if i do that?
and.
ah!
is that the good bit?
"yeah, that's."
that's the good bit.
"that's, that's where the nerve comes up near the skin."
just down here.
is it?
and then it goes.
"yeah, that."
"down the front of your shoulder,."
"see,."
right down.
"right well you see i would have thought if you'd have done it there, that would have been, but no, but see when you."
that's it.
that's it all there.
right in there?
right in there.
now  this is the latest stuff from the  the hospital  for killing the neuralgia.
is it?
mm.
"now, no three of these in a day, and you must stay on it for a month."
right.
"a whole month, agnes."
are you giving me a month's supply?
mhm.
yeah.
"cos , how much, four seventy five now for a prescription, is."
"yeah, well."
it not?
it's.
aye.
"it's not so bad when you get one,."
but see when you get two?
or.
three.
er it's terrible.
"cos i had my er line, it's due up."
yeah.
"er  on, and i'll tell you another thing i've been taking."
"well, the easiest one to show you is there."
all over my body.
spots i see.
see it?
i've more.
i don't know if i've   one up there?
yeah.
aye.
"erm and my leg and that, but i don't know if that was through stress."
it's not bad.
aye.
but that's just been coming.
yeah.
out on me lately.
that's right.
that's just a stress reaction.
"it's see yeah well, did you know my mother died?"
no.
yeah.
she died on the thirteenth of march.
she was only in that new home five weeks.
right.
five weeks she was in it.
"but don't get me wrong, it wasn't a  it wasn't a  er  tragedy as such when  cos it was the."
no no.
oh.
best thing that could have happened to.
yeah.
my mother.
because she was.
she was never happy.
"ah, that was."
you know.
"it was  a, a release."
it was a release because she just went down every day.
yeah.
oh aye.
she went down every day.
now i want to see you in four weeks again.
oh you want to see me in four weeks?
mhm.
how long did you give me my certificate for?
thirteen weeks.
thirteen weeks?
but er you want to see me in four weeks to see about that?
thirteen weeks.
but i want you to come back in four weeks.
mhm.
i want you back in four weeks.
well i didn't have to wait too long for you today.
it's a change.
is it?
i know i keep saying to.
it's a change.
"myself , you know er cos i'm saying i said, how many's that that's been into that doctor?"
"and a new doctor i was talking to, i says, three went in , i says,hope they're all going into , doctor ."
away and look after yourself.
"i think it's, i think it's er i'm just getting old, it doesn't happen ."
"see, i'm used to doing everything myself."
mhm.
i've always had to do everything.
aye.
"and  wheelbarrow,, you know and see now."
"i keep saying,you used to  your children, but they don't do nothing for you now, don't they."
not much.
not?
i wouldn't hold.
your breath waiting for them nowadays.
"so, four weeks?"
"right, see you four weeks."
"er right, aye ."
right agnes.
right.
thanks.
cheerio now.
good morning.
good morning.
"now, what can i do for this lady this morning?"
my  gets thicker every time i come .
"ah you see, that's when you're over twenty one, that's what happens."
it gets bigger and bigger and bigger all the .
it's doctor  that's treating me but she can't see me till monday so.
oh.
that's .
a long wait.
"oh, that's nothing."
that's nothing.
no?
"oh, it's getting, don't come in the school holidays."
aha.
how is it?
cos it's pandemonium.
aha.
"it's er  full of, full of youngsters."
not obeying you.
now just.
what've you been doing?
"doctor  gave me er i can't, i can hardly walk i've got a terrible sore back."
your back been giving you trouble again?
oh terrible.
right.
if i get up out a chair it's murder.
right.
and you say the tablets.
she gave me.
have helped?
no.
i've i was using  what do you call it?tablet but i'd  something .
aha.
not making much difference.
no.
no.
right.
let's see if we can get you something to make life easier for you.
would the physiotherapy help it ?
it might.
"i was just thinking about that just now, whether."
aye.
we should get you down there.
cos it helped me the last time.
was it the monklands?
you ?
pardon?
"was it the monklands you were in, when you dislocated."
yes.
it?
monklands.
wasn't it?
but i was at strathclyde for physiotherapy the last time.
yes.
that's right.
the.
mm.
"i remember you were, you were in, you'd dislocated your hip, dislocated your hip,."
three times.
twice.
three times was it?
three times.
good.
mm.
still on  road?
pardon?
still on  road?
i'm a wee bit.
six.
i'm a wee bit deaf.
six.
a wee bit.
i've been dull of hearing and i haven't got my hearing aid in.
road .
"now, i'll write over and we'll get you back, get you some physiotherapy mrs ."
right?
i think that would help.
mm.
aye.
fine.
er this is a painkiller.
there's nothing else there.
aye.
except pure and simply a painkiller.
aha.
to let you get moving about easier.
aye.
okay.
okay.
and you'll get word about the physiotherapy.
that's fine.
aye.
aye.
how are you keeping yourself?
fine.
"aye, you're looking great."
ah.
there we are now.
"now you get started on that, you'll get a postcard to the house."
aye.
to go back and get some physiotherapy.
aye.
"we'll get, get you fit again."
okay .
get you fit for the dancing.
.
and the.
oh the bone.
but i don't think i'm ready yet.
"oh, i don't think you're ready for that."
aye.
before the end of the season we'll have you back.
alright.
right.
right.
okay mrs .
thank you.
right.
cheerio now.
cheerio.
"a new, a new, a new a new toy."
i'm glad somebody's got something in.
"i'm, i'm the only one working now, they've, they've all packed up for the day."
do have a seat anyway.
"er i've been doing a, been writing a book now, for about ten years."
aha.
"erm i was on the railway for thirty years, as a driver on the railway at  wouldn't remember."
"er no, no."
"bit before my time, i'm afraid."
"and erm anyway it was a wonderful place, wonderful relationship with the men and erm about the only odd thing about it i've come up against a snag which i didn't think i've had a ghost writer, i've got publishers, and as i can't get er permission for all the photos that i want."
"oh dear, that's a shame."
because there's a ten year.
oh.
"er one thing or another,i must have spent a couple of thousand pounds on these photos ."
anyway.
you're just interested.
no no no no.
but er well what it is i've got a mouth problem.
mhm.
"now when i came to see you, i think it were earlier on in the year and i've been to see er the other doctors."
yeah.
"er we had a virus, now i've still got this sore tongue that keeps coming back, very badly."
now the other day when i rung for appointment.
"now presumably you're doing this  er personality analysis, as part of trying to work out who you are and where you're going."
is that right?
that's right.
yeah.
okay.
well that's fine.
"that's what we normally use it for and erm  what i'm going to do if that's okay is i, i'll describe the erm  the actual theory to you."
mm.
and get you to self estimate er where you come on it.
mm.
you see.
and i've got a little chart that i'll give you to do that on.
mm.
"and then erm we'll have three readings, really, of erm  where you come."
mm.
on the chart.
one of which is this erm estimate that you'll do now.
mm.
and then you've filled in a works situations.
mm.
"questionnaire, and that gives us another reading."
mm.
and then there's the proper questionnaire and i've scored that up.
right.
so we get three readings.
okay?
and then erm we work out erm  a best fit.
right.
"er you know so far as we can get that erm and i'll then give you a description of how the theory er predicts your er preferences for behaving in particular ways, would work out."
mhm.
and you can read that and we can have a  bit of a  discussion about that.
mhm.
to see if you think it's appropriate and.
mm.
accurate or not.
"erm and basically er the, the reason for doing it that way is that erm, i don't want to set up a situation where erm i'm some sort of expert and i er  this is not a matching process, okay?"
no.
no.
"it's really to give you er whatever insights you can get from this particular theory, erm about the way in which your, your personality works."
right.
then you can use that er to make er a better career decision.
mm.
and indeed actually it's quite interesting anyway for all sorts of.
mm.
er applications.
"erm but the idea is that it should be, very much be something which you erm er you know the, the estimate is, is something which you've contributed to."
yeah.
have imposed on you by somebody else.
"because the key thing is that you should be more in charge, not that you should be receiving erm some statement from an expert which then determines what happens, you know?"
right.
so it's that sort of process.
mm.
does that sound okay?
that's fine.
that's fine.
good.
okay.
well erm i'll give you the er little chart here.
now erm  oh you've got a pen.
excellent.
"erm if you, if you, if we just er look at that for a moment."
mm.
"the way it works is that the theory, the theory actually erm er has four dimensions."
mm.
that's why there are four of those.
and what we'll do is i'll tell you er what each dimension consists of.
and the idea is that that's the midpoint and there's a one to ten scale going each way.
mm.
and erm you work out whether your preference is very strongly this way or this way or that way.
mm.
and just put a mark on the line to indicate the strength of the preference.
does that sound okay?
mm.
right.
well let me explain briefly the overall structure of the theory.
all personality theories divide personality up into dimensions.
mm.
erm this one has four dimensions.
sometimes they have about twenty.
mm.
"erm and the theories differ, what the dimensions are called, and what it consists of."
"and erm this theory has four dimensions, and each dimension consists of two polar opposite types of behaviour."
and the theory is that every individual has an innate inborn preference for behaving at one end or the other.
mm.
okay?
er now it's important to get the idea of what preference means in this context.
it is not an exclusive predisposition.
mm.
so it doesn't mean to say that you only behave at one end or the other.
erm in fact life requires everybody to behave at both ends.
mm.
but the theory is that there's a biologically inherited preference.
right.
mm.
"now the the analogy which is used, to, to explain this further, is, is with handedness."
are you right or left handed?
right handed.
okay.
"so that means, in, in the analogy that your right hand is your preferred hand."
okay.
erm have you ever tried to write your name and address with your left hand?
yes and i was hopeless at it.
hopeless.
how did you feel while you were trying ?
er really strange actually.
mm.
i felt that i was using a part of me that wasn't used to functioning and i've just recently started juggling.
oh really.
yes.
and er i have a real problem with using my left hand.
oh interesting.
"because erm the, the erm what usually people say is that erm if you use your non-preferred area in the psychological sense, then it's very hard work because you haven't got the same degree of control as you have in the other."
mm.
areas.
"so to achieve a, a sort of given result you have to work much harder."
erm and usually it feels very awkward.
mm.
it doesn't feel comfortable .
erm but if you persist you get better.
mm.
"and you know normally with the handedness, you don't use your left hand unless you break your right wrist or something."
mm.
"but in the psychological area you do have to use it, you know  quite a lot of the time."
mm.
erm but you should be able to improve.
"er you know, but there is this preference."
that's the idea really.
mm.
okay so that's the idea of preference.
mm.
"now there are, there's one preference on each of the four dimensions."
er and that means that there are sixteen different preference combinations you know that.
mm.
are possible.
"erm and er the other thing about it is that although we have to look at, to discover the preference, we have to look at each dimension as a discrete entity, once you've found the preferences, they actually have a dynamic relationship with ."
right.
yeah.
and the description which i'll give you allows for that.
"and also when we, when we've worked out the best fit preference, i'll explain more about how the dynamic relationship."
mm.
works.
okay?
okay.
right.
"so that's, that's the end of the overview."
so shall we start trying to work out what the preferences.
mm.
are?
now the first dimension is extrovert and introvert.
.
yeah.
can you write on this erm extrovert on the left hand end where the dots are and introvert on the other end.
right.
now i'm sure you've heard of these terms before.
mm.
erm but i think the important thing is that jung on whom this er particular theory  it's based on his.
mm.
theories.
erm he was the person who invented those terms.
and he meant something probably rather different from what the popular meaning is.
so it's important to define it really.
"this, this dimension is about er where you prefer to focus your attention and where you get your psychological energy from."
okay?
oh right.
yes.
and that's what this dimension's about.
"and the erm extroverts are people who prefer to focus outside themselves, on the world of people and things."
"the introverts prefer to focus on their own inner world, of hopes, dreams, fears, aspirations, ideas."
whatever's inside.
"now if i give you an example of a bit of behaviour where  erm a situation  and, and er give you an idea of how introverts and extroverts would behave in that area, that may help you to work out which you think you are."
"say you're with a group of students and erm you're sitting round drinking coffee one morning, and the sun's shining."
"and somebody says, let's go to scarborough for the day."
"you know it's a terrific day, let's go to the seaside."
"erm now the extroverts preferred response, to that, is an instantaneous reaction, which they share."
oh terrific idea.
yes.
i'll go and get my fishing rod.
mm.
"or, oh no."
i can't stand the seaside.
couldn't we go to the north york moors.
mm.
instead.
right so instantaneous .
now introverted people hate being asked to make instantaneous reactions.
they actually want to think about it.
"whatever it is, they want to think about it."
"erm and then, they may share."
right.
or they may not.
"erm now what they say about erm extroverts is that, if you don't know what an extrovert thinks, you haven't listened."
she will have told you.
"er if you don't know what an introvert thinks, it's because you haven't asked her."
yeah.
"okay so there is a difference in, in, in that way."
erm and i told you how the extroverts would behave.
"now an extreme introvert, might be er sort of case you know, you're, you're erm er cutting up the sandwiches or whatever preparations you've got to do ."
"er and you then, you get to the time when you're all going to get in the car and go off."
and erm the er this particular person just isn't there.
mm.
well they've decided they're not gonna go.
they haven't actually told anybody.
er er and they've just  disappeared .
mm.
"erm a less introverted erm er response would be, through the preparations to say, well you know actually i'm, i don't really think i can come."
"i mean i've got this person to see, or this essay."
mm.
"to write, or something to buy in town, or whatever you know."
mm.
"they thought it over and they've worked out, and they're not gonna come."
right.
"now these sort of situations do cause a few problems, because, or can do, because erm the extroverts expect everybody to share, you see."
"erm and if you had half a dozen students, and two of them were extroverts, and they both wanted to go, and they both said, yeah."
terrific idea.
and maybe the other four wouldn't like it .
but if.
mm.
"they weren't actually saying anything, then probably the plan would go ahead and, and, and then you might find that you know half of you didn't actually go."
"erm the other thing about extroverts and introverts is that erm, extroverts really like to do their thinking er by er putting out their point of view, and getting everybody else's point of view out, and, and looking at it."
"but for introverts, really, thinking is done in here, you know."
"and they don't, they're not so keen on, on the sharing really."
erm i mean does that give you an idea of which.
yeah yeah.
way you go.
okay.
yeah.
"sorry, do you wanna stick down."
right.
mm.
you were gonna say something.
"is it just, well i was er i mean i find it hard cos i suppose everybody to some extent, in the, the extent to which they live in their own house,."
mm.
are introverted.
if you see.
right.
what i mean.
yeah.
i mean i am just as much as anybody else.
but i think naturally with.
mm.
the sort of analogy with going to.
yes.
scarborough i think i'm much more extrovert.
okay.
yeah right.
and i think i will have come out that way on the thing.
do i put a cross?
yes.
a cross would do fine.
"right, okay, the next one is sensing and intuition."
sensing on the left and intuition on the right.
okay.
right.
"now this one is about erm how you prefer to take in information, how you prefer to understand things."
it's about perception.
mm.
"now the sensing person, prefers to use her five senses to perceive what's going on about her."
and prefers to concentrate on present concrete reality.
"what she can actually see, touch, smell, hear, taste."
mm.
"if she can't see it, touch it, smell it, hear it, taste it, it doesn't exist."
that's extreme but it gives you the idea.
now the intuitive person on the other hand prefers to use her sixth sense.
and erm prefers to focus on future possibilities rather on present reality.
mm.
"so it's not erm, what exactly is the nature of this relationship? it's, how might it develop, what might it become?"
"or not, exactly what is this thing i've got here and what can i use it for now?"
how might it be changed?
what other uses might it have.
erm intuitive people have inspirations and hunches which they trust whereas sensing people are pretty mistrustful of inspiration.
and they don't like intuitive leaps which intuitive people make.
"sometimes they won't, intuitive people can't actually tell you exactly how they've arrived at this perception, they've just got it."
er and sensing people find that extremely odd.
mm.
and erm really very unsatisfactory.
mm.
erm and the sensing people want a step by step logical statement of how somebody has reached erm.
mm.
you know a particular conclusion.
"erm i once, talking to somebody about this and er he said erm, well he said i think i must be an intuitive because i've never let the facts get in the way of a good idea."
mm.
now for er sensing people it's probably the other way round.
mm.
the ideas have to come from the facts.
mm.
do you do you have a.
yeah.
"okay, right."
fine.
jolly good.
next one.
erm next one is thinking on the left.
mm.
right.
and no sorry just thinking.
oh.
and erm feeling on the right.
feeling?
yeah feeling.
now those terms are peculiar.
"you always get trouble with them in psychological tests, cos you either  use terms which nobody knows what they mean, or you use terms which people have meanings for and that's not what you actually mean by them."
and feeling doesn't refer to emotion as such.
this dimension is about erm how you prefer to make decisions.
you've perceived something you've now got to decide what you're going to do or whether you're going to do anything.
and the difference between the two is the material you prefer to work with.
"and the er it's all rational, so it's what sort of material do you prefer to exercise your rationality on."
and the thinking people prefer to use impersonal objective material.
mm.
whereas the feeling people prefer subjective personal.
mm.
material.
"so you've got a situation where if somebody wants to change something they're actually, you know maybe it's something you do in a job or something like this, and somebody says we, we really ought to change this."
or it might be something domestic like maybe you go shopping every same day every week or something.
"erm and somebody says well you, you know, you should change that."
erm then the thinking person's sort of preferred response is to erm seek a tight definition of what the change actually is.
"erm so they'd wanna know well you know if it's a shopping change then erm, do you want me to change the day?"
"do you want me to change what i buy, do you want me to change the time i do it?"
do you want me to change the place i go to?
what exactly is it that.
mm.
"you're, you're, you're saying that i've got to do?"
erm and how'll that effect what went on before.
"it may be there's some sort of sequence to these, this activity."
erm and how does it effect what comes after?
so it's a very logical impersonal sort of approach.
mm.
okay?
"now the feeling person on the other hand faced with this sort of suggestion would immediately start saying, well erm why are we going to do this?"
er who for whom is it a benefit?
or who sees meaning in this change?
for whom is it of value?
is it going to benefit the shop keeper?
"me the, the customer?"
"or you, some of the other people maybe on whose behalf i buy things?"
mm.
"or, you know, who, who is going to benefit from it?"
and how are the people in it?
"so, so really you're looking at the values in it you see."
mm.
"which are essentially subjective and also the people, how are the people who are affected by this, actually going to feel about it?"
"you know, are they actually going to erm er see it as a positive er step?"
or are they gonna see it as negative and disruptive?
and maybe some people will see one way and some people see it another way.
"but er er concentrating on the personal, the subjective."
mm.
yeah.
do you do you get an idea?
yeah.
"okay stick, stick something down there."
right.
good.
"and the, now last one is judging, on the left  and perceiving on the right."
"and this is really about your erm your lifestyle, your preferred lifestyle."
how much planning you actually like to have in your life.
"now the erm judging people want everything to be, well they prefer to have everything cut and dried, sorted out, closed off, decided."
they don't like ambiguity or loose ends.
.
"the perceiving people on the other hand, want to be flexible, spontaneous, and responsive."
mm.
"so if, if they, if everything's planned out, it's a real straitjacket for them."
and they don't like it.
yeah.
"erm now if you think of organizing a party, is quite a useful example of this."
"now judging people don't like loose ends, and get worried if things are not being organized."
okay.
so usually they do the organizing.
"er the perceiving people don't, it doesn't worry them very much, they'll do it all at the last minute and get it sorted out somehow."
"erm so if you've got a judging person and they're having a party, then they will, they will organize it a fortnight in advance."
"and they will erm work out the guest list in a balanced way, whatever they want to happen."
"and erm er they will think about whether they've got enough, be enough room for the number of people."
whether they've got enough chairs.
"where the drink's coming from, how much it's gonna be."
same thing for the food.
"if there are gonna be any activities then if you got a really extreme judging person, on the day, there'll be, you know, sharpened pencils, and sheets of paper, and rules for whatever games are going to be paid."
"now the perceiving person on the other hand, would erm say, about midday, well i think i'll have a party tonight shall we?"
"erm, how are you gonna get everybody there?"
"well we'll see whose around, and tell them, and they can invite a few of their friends, and we'll see how it goes."
what about the drink?
oh tell everybody to bring a bottle.
er what are we actually gonna do?
well we'll see.
"i mean when people come, see who knows any good games, and they can organize them."
you know.
"er so it's all, all frightfully open-ended, and flexible and."
mm.
quite different.
"and, and, and the judging person invests a lot of effort in the actual organization."
and they get actually pretty upset if only half the people come.
"because you know, there's all this stuff ready ."
"or if twice as many people come, they get upset too, because they haven't got enough."
"whereas the perceiving person is much mm less phased by this and says, oh well there are lots of people, that's nice."
i don't know half of these people.
i've lots of new people i can meet.
"or erm if only half the people come, well that's fine we can have a much more sort of intimate evening, and erm actually there'll be lots of food  for everybody won't there?"
you know.
mm.
"so they're much more, more flexible about."
yeah.
things.
"and, and, the judging people, their ideal event is one which goes exactly to plan."
"whereas for the perceiving people, that's probably pretty boring."
mm.
okay?
yeah.
i can work.
"oh pretty, pretty far down that."
track.
okay.
right.
let's have a look.
erm now you get erm a letter for each of the preferences.
that's the way erm they do it.
and you can't have i.
"it's usually the, the first letter but."
mm.
"you can't have i, because i for introvert."
mm.
so it's n for intuitive.
"n, p for perceive."
right.
now we'll have a look at the erm the work situations one.
"you may remember, you, you can see what's going on now."
"that's extrovert, sensing, thinking and judging,."
yes.
you see.
and i simply add the ticks and see which comes out.
yeah.
and it comes out the same.
yeah.
so that's fairly straightforward.
erm this is not very accurate.
mm.
and it's not a fine discriminator.
erm but in fact certainly those three you've got a very clear you know.
mm.
six difference is not much on the other side.
mm.
anything on that .
now this one is closer.
mm.
"erm but it's still, still reasonably clear and then we've got this which is erm it's all er constructed there's a weighted score."
mm.
you see so you actually get that.
er and that's the same again so we haven't got any problems i don't think about the fit.
that's from the questionnaire?
yes it is.
mm.
and in fact it's interesting that the erm the extrovert is actually quite high.
mm.
on that.
"people say that, in fact all your scores are quite high while p is the, actually that's rather, rather."
that's yeah.
different from that isn't it?
and those are the same.
well i think it  yeah because when i was filling in.
yeah.
"i, i mean there were a lot of questions like you know does."
the idea of making.
yeah.
a list for things.
oh yes.
appeal to you.
those sorts of questions.
and it doesn't appeal to me but i know that i should do it.
"and i, i know that i'm forced to do it."
and so sometimes i think my sense of obligation.
yes ah.
carries me so.
but whereas when you were talking about it then i mean when i think about it.
it's quite obvious that's what you're most comfortable doing.
i resist it.
but yeah.
yes.
"well you see what happens is that, erm you, you may have a preference but you learn that you've got to use this other behaviour."
mm.
yeah.
and so you do.
yeah.
you know.
but that doesn't alter the fact that your preference is the other way.
yeah.
"and in fact it's quite interesting sort of analysis this because erm i, i actually think that the erm the best er  well it helps you if you know where your preference is, because if, if then you're behaving in the other area then you know that that's not your preference."
mm.
and therefore if it's difficult.
well you know it's difficult and you know why it's difficult.
mm.
but you can do it because you know you can go back home in to the other area.
"whereas if you think well you know this is, i'm doing this but i don't know whether this is me and i don't feel very comfortable with it and all that."
mm.
"it, it's actually much more difficult to do it."
mm.
"erm so in a way knowing your preference, doesn't mean that you can't do this."
mm.
or that you don't.
er and perhaps er you know you can have a role where maybe you've gotta make decisions and alright you do it.
you know.
erm but it makes it easier in some.
mm.
ways.
"erm and, and it explains to you what's happening."
mm.
"which, which can be quite, quite useful."
yeah.
erm.
okay.
"so i'll give you the, the, the description."
erm.
is that quite a high score there?
i mean.
oh yes.
some of them are quite.
definitely in one.
"well the thing is, the interesting thing about this is is what we're actually dealing with is not erm  well in a sense er not, not erm your actual preference, which the erm theory is unchangeable."
you.
mm.
"know it's, it's in you."
genetically inherited.
erm but whether it actually erm is realized in practical behaviour.
mm.
is another matter.
just like the sort of nature nurture argument.
mm.
in biology.
"you know you might have a gene which says well you'll grow to be six foot, but if you're not fed properly."
yeah.
then it won't happen.
mm.
so and it's the same thing with the preferences.
mm.
"so in fact a high score is, is quite good because it means that you recognize what your preferences actually are."
mm.
you know.
"so it doesn't mean, you know, a higher score on perceiving doesn't mean that you er necessarily very seldom er exhibit judging behaviour."
"you might exhibit quite a lot of judging behaviour, but it feels peculiar to you and you know it's an effort."
"and so you're quite clear that your, your preference is perceiving."
mm.
it doesn't actually mean necessarily erm how you behave.
mm.
if you see what i mean.
cos jung had this idea that the whole  the whole of life was a journey towards the discovery of what he called the real self.
mm.
now that's a bit of an elusive concept really but i think people have er a sort of idea that there is a real them.
mm.
"somewhere, and that this probably gets pulled about."
mm.
"by relationships, by external events, by roles which they take on."
and erm therefore it's quite a real thing to a lot of people.
"and what the, this preference thing is after, is describing the real self."
mm.
"there's also er i mean i think there are, well there are probably lots of selves but, but erm er there's the real self."
"the sort of inner self if you like erm although that's expressed in, in behaviour quite often."
"and then there is how you behave, which may not be the same thing as the real self."
and then there's an idealized self.
the sort of.
mm.
person you might like to be but actually unfortunately aren't.
you know.
mm.
and  the real self's probably somewhere between the behaving self and the idealized.
mm.
"self, you know."
"erm well let me find this, fish this out for you and er you can er have a look at this and see what you think."
okay.
thanks.
read that and see whether you think it's er accurate or which bits of it click and which bits of it don't.
mm.
"most, most of it's true."
yeah.
okay.
"well let me explain the erm  oh that's, that's a description on the back."
can i have that back for a minute and i'll just explain one of the erm  more of the structure of it.
e n f p.
"now the, the theory erm is that there are four mental functions in the middle here."
"and the extrovert and introvert, and judging and perceiving are sort of orientations."
so if you imagine that erm you're a motor vehicle alright?
and the e i and the j and the p are if you like sort of part of the bodywork which decides whether you're a sports car or a heavy goods.
mm.
vehicle or whatever.
but the engine that actually drives you.
mm.
is these four mental faculties okay?
erm or mental functions.
now one of these is dominant okay?
"and that's, in your case, that's that one."
and then the other one you then have an auxiliary or second one.
and those are the two preferences.
mm.
okay?
"and then the other two erm, less preferred areas, erm the least preferred is opposite the erm number one, the most preferred, and the third one is opposite the second one."
now this has some implications for decision making.
mm.
"if, if you actually,and a career decision is one type of decision."
"erm if, if you want a good decision you've gotta use all four mental functions."
mm.
but the preference theory suggests that erm you will use them in order of preference.
"so er if you've got a er a problem, say the career, what are you going to do with yourself?"
well the first thing you do is start thinking of lots of possibilities you see.
"and erm you get all these possibilities erm set out, and then you use your feeling judgement to er cut them down."
mm.
"er you say, well you know alright there are all these things i could do but erm er what, where do i think i really want to work?"
i mean where would it be worthwhile for me to work?
you know.
what do i  what is so important to me that i want to spend all this time on it?
"you know, how does this fit with my value system?"
so you'd use.
mm.
your value system to actually erm fine down the number of possibilities.
now the danger is for n f people that they don't use the s and the t.
"and the theory you would then, after you'd used the n and the f you'd then start to use the t which is the sort of logical thing."
you'd say well what am i trained to do?
what sort of background have i got?
what skills have i got?
do i need training to do this?
mm.
"and then the s, the senses, the last."
erm is really about erm well are there any jobs in this?
and do people actually get paid to do it?
and what sort of activities do they actually engage in?
mm.
what is the nature of the experience of somebody who actually does this?
mm.
"and if n fs are not careful, they've got this terrific sort of value laden possibilities idea."
mm.
which is vague and erm you know er and they never get to well what are the skills?
and where are the jobs?
"and, and what actually do you do day to day?"
"i mean it may, may fit your values and it may have lots of possibilities but what are actually gonna be doing and will you actually be capable of it or, or enjoy it or whatever."
so you need all four and it's not a criticism to start with the n and the f.
that's how you are and that's how you have to start.
i mean it's no good you starting on the s and the t.
"you'd get bored with it before you'd, you know,but you need to bring the others in."
mm.
"that's, that's the thing."
mm.
"so erm you know that's what i'm really talking about is more a question of the process of erm career choice, than it is saying what you should do."
mm.
"erm there is something which i suppose can be said about what you should do, if you're an n f and a, and a,a dominant intuitive."
"by the way this tells you what your, you see your dominant is intuition and then with feeling ."
mm.
"erm now er if intuition is the dominant thing and you're an extrovert, then you erm really need situations er where you can change things."
where you can actually erm make things change.
mm.
"erm and if you're a er an intuitive feeling person, then really it's crucial that your value system is accommodated in what you do."
mm.
you know that makes a huge difference really.
mm.
erm so that's very important.
"erm hmm yeah, yeah."
well that's about it i think.
erm what are you actually thinking about doing anyway?
erm or haven't you got that far yet?
well i think i've got stuck on the n and the f actually .
i see.
so we want some s and t .
we do yeah.
no  well i've just had erm an  interview and erm  really just exploring the things that i myself thought of trying.
yeah.
"probably erm i think i'll, i'll do  on the."
oh yeah.
yeah mm mm.
"and do that for a while some, some voluntary work."
that  what i was thinking of doing for next year.
"it's really, i mean next year i was quite i'm quite committed to not having a year off just exploring things and that's what."
right.
what erm heather?
yes heather  yeah.
yes that's what she said.
she said you.
mm.
"cos i haven't, like she perceived that i was very kind of  lost really."
and you know didn't know enough about the different areas of work that i was interested in.
and she said oh the best thing to do is just sort of travel for a bit.
mm.
"not travel aimlessly, but travel with a purpose."
mm.
and find out as much as possible and then erm try and get something for the year after.
for nineteen ninety .
"yes well you'll need to do some s and t you see, erm before you go off on your travels."
that's it .
otherwise you really won't know what you're coming back to so.
well exactly.
no i couldn't face that i don't think.
i've got to do something.
right.
"well that's what i'm, i'm doing here and."
yes.
"trying to work, work."
yeah.
things out.
yes.
"cos it, it's true that i resist it."
you know i mean i didn't want to come today.
i resist.
no no.
the sort of process.
"yes, yes."
you know i just think that i should be able to get a job just like that and.
yes yes.
well erm sometimes you can.
"but, but it is, it is dangerous because maybe it doesn't work."
erm and especially.
"in the current climate you see it's also erm interesting because this, this, this sort of theory depends who's interviewing you."
"if, if, if they're erm an intuitive feeling person, then they may think that's okay."
"er but if they're a sensing thinking person they will find it almost totally incomprehensible, that you've been so lax as not to have actually worked out in detail erm you know what their job is?"
and erm why you want it?
"and why you, why it fits?"
you know why they should employ you given you know what are your skills.
yeah.
and what are your this and what are your that.
and really even the n f recruiters will er want some of that.
"well i think for them to be in, in management, top management positions a lot of them they'd have to be pretty sensing and thinking before  well i do i mean i think there's."
"yeah, yeah, yeah."
"room for my sort of personality in most careers, but to some extent it's got to be you know balanced and."
"yes you've, you've got to do the lot you see."
"so, so you need to get."
the s t bit.
i mean have you done the erm any of these other things?
i mean you've done the personality thing.
"er if you've seen, have you seen this wherever it is."
erm oh it's .
the erm planning your future thing or not?
"no, no, no."
well it doesn't matter anyway.
erm.
this thing?
oh yes.
i've got that.
you've got that?
mm.
"you've got that, you've got that."
"right, you've got that."
yeah.
"now i'm, i am trying to work through it methodically actually."
"yeah, yeah."
"yeah, yeah."
okay.
well erm.
this has been quite helpful though.
i do feel that.
cos what you've done then is that.
mm.
"i've done the, i'm just in the middle of the skills one."
oh are you?
yes oh jolly good.
yes.
yes.
that's quite interesting.
"well it is because that actually does, with the pie chart, lead you into sort of chunks of work area."
mm.
which you know then you can explore a bit.
"what comes across in both my interests and any skills which isn't really reconcilable with this i don't think is that erm i've got , , i think it's cos of my academic experience cos i did an arts degree with a lot of research and stuff, is that i, i like researching, data collecting, processing information."
which isn't really i mean i don't think.
not an n fs thing.
not really no.
no it isn't.
erm well you have to decide i suppose erm  which way you wanna go.
mm.
you know.
although you see erm as we've been suggesting any project requires that.
"you know you, you, you need to be doing some of that."
"it, it's just a question of i suppose whether you do it or you get other people to  do it or  or what."
"you know but, but probably to start with whatever you're gonna have to do you're gonna have to do."
"and i think the s and t thing is, is erm it's very good to have developed skills in those areas."
it's a question of where you harness them really though isn't it?
well it's erm i mean helen suggested.
mm.
librarianship and it was.
mm.
"something which, that interested me but i do think i'll find it boring or something."
yes well no this wouldn't necessarily.
support that.
"erm it, it would depend i suppose erm well the n f people they want to be able to change things you see."
you can't change things much in a library.
no.
"erm er if they're, if they're introverts, then it's alright changing things just by changing people's perception."
"so erm you know you, you, you  i mean i'm i n f j and so it's alright for me to think i've changed your thinking."
whether you actually do anything about it is you you know.
mm.
"so i, i mean i suppose in a sense it would be good if you did actually change something but that's not entirely necessary for me."
"if, if, if it's given you a slightly different slant on it, and you're thinking has changed."
in some way.
then that's okay for me.
"now if i was an extrovert, it wouldn't actually be enough."
"i, i, i would want actually to see real results you see from erm the change."
"that you had actually shifted from this to that, and you went off and did whatever it was."
mm.
you know.
"i i think you probably need more er , of, of, of results."
erm although you see you could get that in librarianship.
"if erm you, you might erm in time er er you know become er the, the librarian or something."
"well then you're, you're managing the thing, and you're actually responsible for trying to work out which way it's going."
mm.
you see.
so in a sense that might come later on.
"so you might find that er and in, in some ways it's rather interesting, because your s and t skills might get you the job."
"in a sense, you know, you wouldn't get it without them."
"erm but what's needed for later on, might be the n and the f."
"because erm you know you can't manage people without some consideration for er for their, their views and how things affect them ."
erm and you need to look at the big picture.
mm.
yeah it's no good getting bogged down in the detail.
"so i suppose whatever area you went into, erm you might find it frustrating to start with, because you weren't looking at the big picture."
"well i think that, that my problem is, you know like,cos i did do the p g c s."
oh you did.
you came and talked to me.
yeah.
about it then didn't you once?
and that was my problem with it was that i was in much  being able to go into the classroom and talk to the kids and have a really good relationship with the teachers and things.
and i discovered that.
and it didn't work out.
"to actually create the right learning environment for them, there were a thousand little details that i had to attend to, like had i planned my lesson right, was i progressing in the right way round the classroom, had i remembered to chase up certain people's homework, and stuff."
and that i find incredibly difficult.
you know it was a real effort for me to remember all those things.
"because i am so kind of, you know i've got ideas coming in and my head all the time."
"but you know  i still think that i'm drawn towards that sort of teaching, performing that kind of role erm and that wouldn't be fulfilled by librarianship ."
no.
but i don't think it would do me any harm to develop some more organizational skills because most jobs require them.
yes.
you know i don't think you can get by without them really.
you know i mean you have to have time management skills to have a reasonably.
well you do don't you?
yes.
"successful life, don't you?"
i mean it's no use being.
"yes, that's right, that's right."
"i mean  as i said when i was filling in the questionnaire i was thinking well this, really this is my preference and you know i'd much rather be in a job that allowed me some flexibility."
you know down to the line planning for every single moment of the day.
but having said that i can't see a job where you can just kind of swan in and you know and think about a million different things in one day or whatever.
so you know i mean i i suppose a the questionnaire seemed to concentrate very much on how you were outside work.
and i mean i everyone has to resign themselves i think to some extent but the fact that  they are playing a role within their work situation.
right.
and they can't allow their personality free expression .
i mean that's what another thing i found very hard about teaching.
and the teachers commented on it.
they said that i was too much of myself.
you know i had to assume this more detached role.
from the kids.
yeah.
yeah.
"well it, it, teaching has a lot of er er problems with that really because it's, it's, it's playing a role."
"i mean it's acting, teaching more or less."
yeah.
"and you know and you, you, you got to have, gotta get, you know, you have to get cross with them if they misbehave or whatever because otherwise there isn't any order in the place."
mm.
and you know those sorts of things have to go on.
erm i'm just trying to think what other sorts of jobs you might be interested in.
i think anything with writing.
i mean that's come up again and again.
journalism and that kind of thing.
yes.
yeah yeah.
but there's a lot of s t in journalism isn't there?
quite a lot of s.
"you've gotta do your, you know, go out and sit in the county court and wait for something exciting to happen."
"well especially again when you're, when you're training."

"or sixty two rather but his father lived until he was eighty six and his father was the district goods and passenger manager at cambridge and er later on, , er when he was old enough, he, he was in the same office as his father was but not the same position, you see, but he was a clerk, a railway clerk, and his brother was stationmaster of colchester and his grandfather was also a stationmaster and that would be in queen victoria's reign when, when railways first began and then again, you see, in those first days, you see, when there were highwaymen and that sort of thing erm signalmen, signalmen were issued with a truncheon for their own safety, you see, and i've got one."

"you did, didn't you?"
"i did, yes."
"and er, and so, and er as i say er i've had a most wonderful life and i've been a widow now for ten years."
"it's ten years ago since i lost hugh but er, i don't feel lonely er not really."
"well you've got so many friends and sisters, haven't you?"
"well i've got so many happy memories, you see, well then when hugh and i married, you see, er we had apartments down at."
"oh, really?"
yes and we.
"that was, that was  divided into flats then was it then?"
"oh no, no, no, well there's an old lady lived there named mrs  and her husband was a clergyman."
they called him father .
"at one time he, he lived at, they lived at  but er er she was a widow and she was ninety but she was very good to us and, but we had er, we had apartments but there was a lock on both sides of the door, you know what i mean, we were quite self-contained and we had er er a narrow stairs and the war i couldn't, you couldn't er, i used to scrub the stairs down because you couldn't buy carpet in those days, you see the war and to the shortage of stuff and so i used to keep those stairs nice and, we had a, a, we went, as we went up these stairs erm it, i suppose originally, you see, it would have been back stairs for the servants, you see, in the hall and this old lady used to go in and if ever she had the doctor she used to ask me if i would go and sit with her and hold her hand while the doctor came, you see."
"she had other daughters in the town but she always wanted me and if ever she wanted anything to do with her papers and books and financial things, she used to ask my husband to go in, you see  the day after we got there she brought us a huge dish like that with mushrooms which er grew er well there are houses built there now but er at that time they had a big meadow there a copse er in it with a bunch of trees and you see and all these mushrooms grew, you see, and they were, you know, they're nice you see."
"we paid rent to be there and er and either hugh or me or both of us came up to see my mother every day, you see, unless we knew she was going to have a visitor and then we used to take a day off."
mm.
and we'd go off to felixstowe or somewhere but you see we still went away because he had four first class passes a year.
mm.
"being on the railway and er, you see, er and i went then under his pass i suppose mr and mrs  then and er and then we started to er when my parents first died we, we started to get around."
yes.
"you see, and so we went to oh inverness, aberdeen and across to the isle of skye, and down the skye and back across the water to mallaig you see and er then we stayed one time at fort william and because i love scotland, so did he and erm and, and then and all and then, and another thing, erm, this is before i married erm i went down, oh no, both of us, that's right, we went down to stay at erm not, not portsmouth er southsea er there, there's a place near there, next door."
eastbourne?
"no, not eastbourne, erm."

"anyway it's quite near portsmouth and we heard that the first queen elizabeth ship, they don't say it's the first but they call this one the q e two but there was a q e one, you see at one time and so we took a coach from there to southampton because we heard that she was in dock there and so we went and there were crowds of people and all in a queue waiting to go in."
well we took our turn and we waited to go in but once we got in we broke the crowd and when they all came out and went to lunch in the town we didn't.
"we stayed and we went up every deck and there was even a gentleman, he showed us up on the bridge on that er on that and, and there was the little shop and i bought  i thought i must buy something on the queen elizabeth and i bought a pen."
"one of these er, i suppose it'd be a ballpoint or whatever you call it and this, i've still got it, it says on the queen elizabeth, see, and er, you see, we said, we said, well never mind very much, we can have something a snack afterwards and so we stayed on there from eleven o'clock in the morning until three in the afternoon, you see, and er er and we were wandering around and we saw the dining room, we saw the captain's table and er, you know it was, and, and then we looked along one deck, we were high up, and down below there were rows of, rows of lifeboats you see."
there was an accident.
of an accident.
yes.
"you see, but oh i enjoyed, we had some lovely holidays."
"yes, sounds like you did."
"i, i did, and then as i say er, you know, with my husband, well i had lovely holidays before but when you've got a companion it's all too different isn't it?"
it is.
"i really, that's what i live on now, memories of the happy holidays i've had with him and, and even to this day i keep in touch."
"janet posted a letter for me last week to a friend who i worked with at ipswich, she was one of the girls behind the counter and at the moment they, her and her husband, he, he, he, he was on the, he finished up but he started as a lad in the kitchen but he finished up as a chef on the dining cars and they married and er and they've got er two children erm they're married to and, and we kept, we've kept for sixty years."

"and she we we were good friends, you see."
mm.
"when er, we've kept friends you see, they don't come here often, like me they're getting old."
mm.
"and she's got arthritis, well in her knees, same as i have but not quite so bad because er, well now, but then again she's younger than i am er several years younger than me and, but she's getting on and so is jack you see and er, and er so erm i've had a, as i say, i've had, i've had a wonderful life really."
you have haven't you?
you know you say you lived in at ipswich station?
yes.
"erm, didn't, at needham market didn't people live in there or  main entrance?"
where?
at needham market station.
"oh, well,i don't know what it's like now but because the booking office is closed."
"yes,that used to be through the main entrance, isn't it, the booking office."
you go through the main door up the steps.
"you go up the steps, in the main door."
mm.
and the booking office was on the left.
mm.
"and the stationmaster's office faced the platform but there is another door that to get into you got in the main door to the left, you see and with a flap and that's the door that we used to take in the parcels, you see and very often we used to go in that door or sometimes we would go through the platform and go in the stationmaster's door, you see and then there again, if i took messages  to the stationmaster on the single  telegraph er i had to go down the steps because more often than not that they were in the basement."
"it was, there's the basement and then a large room above where they used to have meetings er, you see, and er, and er, well they did they had friends from stowmarket go and visit them, you see."
didn't the stationmaster and the clerk live on the premises?
"er, oh yes, they lived in the station  next  you see."
that's the bit that joins on one side of the main entrance area?
yes.
"they've got there are two little doors aren't there, which are probably their front doors?"
"well,yes, well that's it, they are going facing the station  and it used to be so much prettier than it is now."
mm.
pretty  the daisies and things and the stationmaster lived that side.
"which side, what on the left hand side as you face."
"as you face the station, he lived that side you see and er there, the room where they used to entertain their friends was just the other side of the wall  the booking office, you see, and er he was such a kind man, his name was mr."
mm.
"and his, his er son was one of the lads who worked in the office doing the middle turn, you see, and er i don't know if he's still alive."
"he must be eighty, because i mean there wasn't all that much difference in our ages."
you don't know where he went to when he left?
"well i, he lived at stowmarket for years but then i heard not so long ago that they had moved to ipswich but where i don't know but they must be, whether he's  than i have now i don't know either."
on the other side was the chief clerk would live?
"no, he, no i think it was er, i can't remember who lived there."
i think it was one of the signalmen or.
aha.
"i can't remember exactly who lived on the right hand side, i've forgotten but i know the chief clerk lived just a little way down , you see, er."
in one of those little red brick cottages?
"yes, that's right down there, down there, down  and as i say who i took early and late turns with and er why i  same as at cambridge."
there were twenty five staff.
was this at needham?
"no, not needham."
oh.
no i had nothing to do with the staff at the.
"no, no that was at ipswich."
"he, he were a stationmaster, you see, er he was exceptionally nice man."
you never heard him say a bad word or anything like that .
"well he was  quite, he was a good man."
he used to .
"oh i cried when i left there, i really did, it upset me."
yes.
but and when we all  quite shock.
"how many were working there, how many girls were working there then at needham?"
only me.
"so  you, yes."
only me in the office.
yes.
"you see, and er the porters did the er er cleaned the waiting room and dusted, you see."
"well, there was a porter there, called len  and he, he was eighteen and er you know well i  i was as i said sixteen, so he was older than me but he, whilst he was at needham he said well when i'm eighteen i'll get my calling up papers."
"cos that's during the first world war, you see, and erm, he did and so he said goodbye to us all and he said  i'm going up now to say goodbye to your mother and he ran up the street here to say goodbye to my mother."
"she made some tea, she told me afterwards and stayed and stayed and stayed and he lived at prindon and his mother was very very deaf and my mother got worried because he was going away the next day and she said to him, len don't you think you ought to spend the evening with your mother and he said, yes, i'll go now and he ran off and he ran back again and he said, you don't mind if i write to ivy do you?"
"she said, no you write and he'll, she'll write back, you see but, and he went out to france and he was killed in three months and  and his name, so they told me was on the er,on the board  at er ."
do you know i often wonder what happened to the honour board at needham market.
"there used to be an honour board and i was on it and so was miss  's brother, er ivor  because er whoever won the scholarship, you see, their name went on the honour."
"oh, i see."
"board, over the door."
in the church?
"no, no, in the school, er in the er, no it wouldn't be in the church, no."
"in the school, oh."
and i'm talking now about the old school.
mm.
because i don't know anything about these new schools.
no.
no i don't know what's happened to that.
"no, i, i wondered because er it was quite an honour to have your name."
yes.
put on the honour board.
yes.
"you see, and my name was on there, as i say and miss  was the top ."
"no i don't know whether hers was on, but i know her brother's was, you see, i, he died ."
yes.
"so how many worked there, there was a lot of people worked at needham station then."
"there were what, two porters."
"er, yes there would be two porters, yes."
then there was you.
yes.
and two clerks.
and two these two lads er.
so there'd be two clerks and two lads?
"no, one clerk."
"one, one."
chief clerk.
chief clerk  two lads.
and i took early and late turns with him.
yes.
but the other one went on the district.
"oh, i see, yes."
as i said before as a relief clerk.
yes.
for holidays and sickness and then later on relief stationmaster.
yes.
and you see eventually he got a station of his own at thorpe le soken.
yes.
you see down on the.
yes.
so that's how many.
and then the stationmaster.
the signalman.
"how many signalmen, just the one?"
well no cos he had  actually.
"so there'd be two signalmen, would there?"
yes.
that's nine people worked at needham station.
"yes, i, i."
works there now you see.
they don't work there?
"no, no, the signal box is closed."
"oh, now, is it really?"
"yes, yes."
well i heard not so long ago that they were going to either pull it down or.
"well i think they want to keep it, either there or move it somewhere."
"oh, well i, i think that'll be a shame."
it would be a i think they've they don't want to lose it.
no.
i hope not.
but as i say they might.
they have how things have deteriorated since.
"it's amazing, that there was nine people who worked there at the time of the war."
yes.
"you see, and when i was at cambridge, you see, and that was during the second world war, well , you see, i remember seeing a plane because the station was a prime target."
"yes, yes."
"and somehow i don't know how, but somehow they always knew when the train was being loaded up with tanks and then that was the night we would get a raid and , you see, they all tried for the station."
"well, you know,you see, time were, i don't know i suppose, i don't know but i never seemed to be afraid and i used to have my   or something round my waist, a belt with the keys hanging on and they supplied me with a  as well, one of these, i don't know what they're made of  they weren't all that heavy but still they were heavy enough to keep on."
"i mean they weren't aluminium so they blew off  i used to wear one of those and er, you know, for safety, you see, but er anyway i survived the  survived the war  and  but it's amazing really when i look back how we how we managed because we had such nice people in there, as i say and like these actors jack  claude  cecily ."
"they all came down and used to come in our rooms and all sorts of other  and i met some very and , all nationalities, you see and they were, well cambridge has always been noted for different nationalities, hasn't it?"
mm.
"and i loved the town and although the station was about a mile from the town centre, people used to come from the town centre in their cars, they had lunch at our place er er at cambridge, you see, and there, there were two waiters and one, one of them took part-time cellar work, you see, and er, they were two brothers  and er their name's."
"the younger one they call tiny  because he was the smaller than his brother but the other one  you see and we did enormous business, especially during the war."
mm.
but er.
yes.
"you see  and i'm glad i didn't miss it, i'm glad i went through all what i did and, and this particular raid, you see, the siren went and they said a telegraph office  read, you see,and then i thought i'll go to the back door and i went to the, well it was actually on the front of the station and i went to the front of the station and there was this plane swooping down like that and , you see, the bombs didn't fall down straight like that but they went as the plane went and they knocked down a row of houses at the end of the road."
"yes a row of houses  and when i saw i looked out the door and there was this plane swooping down like that and it seemed so low because they were aiming and the bomb fell in the cattle market and, and i threw myself the stone floor, you see, and er and presently one of the ambulance men came round to my office door and he said, are you alright?"
"i said, yes thanks."
"i sat by the fire knitting and er he said,i can see ."
"well you took all this sort of things in your stride but the next day we heard about these houses being knocked down, you see, and i think that's the nearest i've been to be killed but one day, one saturday and that was in a daylight raid, one saturday afternoon because, you see, i was off every afternoon but i worked till ten every night, you see, and er so erm but hugh worked during the day and he was off in the evening, that's why he used to come down to see, to see us and er he used to come in er you see and leave his lodgings and, oh be about nine o'clock and he spent the last day up there perhaps with his friends, have a chat, and er, you see, and but er and i was walking along  it was called and suddenly a plane came over and i thought oh i expect it's one of ours."
"when all of a sudden they dropped a bomb and i thought there wasn't , you see, and no siren had gone, nothing, you see, and there was broad daylight."
mm.
"you see, we heard about it afterwards, you see,."
"yeah, yes."
"but er i don't know perhaps we were braver than these days, perhaps you were braver when you're young."
"mm, yes, perhaps that's true, yes."
"when you worked at needham, you must have seen all the toings, comings and goings on station yard,yard and a lot of cattle coming and going."
"well no, er we, no we didn't, the only cattle we saw was when they were on the train, cos i don't remember they, they seemed to."
i don't know whether they dealt with cattle.
aha.
it was mostly seeds and stuff like that.
yes but  you know russell .
"i know he, he's older than me."
"yeah, yeah, well he's  i interviewed him er last year and he was telling me that he remembers going up into the loft in  's erm, the whole of the station yard was full of cattle."
oh.
so  loaded the train.
"oh, oh i didn't know that, i, i perhaps that was, perhaps that was."
i think they were all going to market because  obviously had a farm.
oh yes they did.
so it's possibly one market day i think he said.
"yes, well that might be the time, you see when perhaps i was at cambridge."
yes.
"it might have been later than, than er when you worked there."
yeah.
he was saying  people going on the trains is it when you worked there animals.
oh i  no animals.
no.
"you see, no animals were er, only in the, in the trucks, you see."
mm.
"passed through, because they didn't stop at needham and er but i always thought, you see, there were, i don't know several clerks in that office as i remember but i can't remember who they were anyway i didn't have, we didn't have much to do with them."
"no, no."
"you see, they were just more or less sort of, i thought they were just sea merchants."
mm.
yes that's probably to do with  farm.
"er, yes."
"no, not the mill really."
"aha, yes."
i imagine.
"i, i don't remember any cattle."
no it may have been later.
yes.
or being older he may have remembered times before that.
"yes, yes that's true yes because how."
old would he be now then?
"oh, he must about ninety."
i tried to remember when you said he was born.
oh.
"i can't remember maybe, he must be about ninety."
"yes, well i was er, you see born in eighteen ninety nine."
yes.
so i go as the years go.
yes.
"you see and like eighty six, now this year, i shall be eighty seven but you see when it comes to the end of the year, the turn of the year, i'll still be eighty seven."
"yeah, yes."
"you see, until my next birthday, , you see, but i, well each year, you see, i always say well to my friends i am so thankful for my friends who drop in and each year i say, well i don't suppose i will be here much longer but i shall be here, i hope, while i can walk."
mm.
but when i can't walk well i shall call in the doctor.
cos i i don't have a doctor year in hardly ever.
"i'm thankful for my good health, you see, because arthritis, you see, i'm as well as anything and i hope i'm still in my right mind, you see, but i, now and again, i forget names."
"mm, but then i forget  names, my husband is dreadful with names."
well er.
he would even sometimes  recognize.
yes.
with people he knows quite well.
oh i see.
i think it's just some people are like that and some are.
"i i forget people, i forget but then, you see, as i never go out."
"well i went out once last year, you see, and i was lucky enough but and for years and years and years i took fynnon salts and which is supposed to be good for rheumatism."
"this last couple of days i've started again but you see er that was before paracetamol came on, on the scene."
mm.
and i have tablets from the doctor and you see as i say from the waist upwards i'm.
yes.
i feel well and and i try er and my husband's nieces they often ring me up er well i was on the phone to one of them when you came yesterday.
"er and she said i'll ring you i said oh dear someone now coming to the door, she said, never mind i'll ring you on saturday, so i said alright and er and she lives at wyndham, norfolk, my husband's niece and erm, you see, and then there's the other one and she said, auntie you're always so cheerful , i said, well i try to be cheerful because like everybody else i get depressed sometimes because, you see, i have no sisters and brothers, i have three elderly cousins who live away and who i, who i see, one was here a fortnight ago  er er er my cousin and his wife er, you see, it will be on a wednesday, a fortnight today, no thursday, yes, you see, a fortnight ago and they said, we'll come again we've always bought you a bunch of daffodils so we shall come again when the daffodils are  and er and they bring me over bits and pieces because er she was a cook and they bring me something nice to eat."
"that's nice, isn't it?"

"no and being, marrying at forty four er no family."
mm.
"you see, you haven't got any family?"
"no, not yet."

"oh, that's what i mean er and you'll have to make haste won't you?"
"oh i don't know, i don't know whether it'll be like mark and jenny and  perhaps never get round to it ."
"no, i know, well i mean what is there for young people to look forward to these days and i feel really sorry for them and i mean all i hope is that jenny will get a job."
oh yes.
when she's finished.
yes.
"er but i don't know whether there's any prospect, do you think she."
"don't know, don't know."

"he er, hugh and i used to come up every day do what we could, you see, in those days if you had a stroke you had to lay there till you died."
mm.

"to make you, to get you going again."
"yes, that's right."
yeah  they do so much more nowadays.

"but but, you see, i am told that she's going to live next door to the, where she used to live the doctor's house er er unless."
"that's pulled down, you know almost opposite the united reform church."
which house is that?
"well there you, i don't know what it's like now but they."
"it's not quite opposite, is it?"

"yeah, everyone said how nice he was and old dr  was quite a character."

mm.
"you see i'm talking about his father but i liked er mrs  's first husband, you see and er i hear that her second husband isn't all that good."
"no, no he wasn't well, i went to see her er i think he may have had a stroke and he can't get about very well."

and i think he finds it difficult to speak.
yes.
.
"and is he, is he at home?"
"last when i saw her he was, yes."

"mrs  was very kind, she sent me a box of  mince pies and barley water and shortbread  all sorts, you know."

mm.
yes.
"and you've got to keep busy and you see now my sight has gone i now, not long distance, i can sit here and see television."
mm.
"you see i moved more  now but and i  i've still got good hearing er this ear here, this ear, i can't hear so well, quite so well, this side, you see so i always have to say excuse me while i, hang on while i turn off the television, you see, and then they have to wait a minute till i turn it off and then what i do is because i have this phone extension put in."
yes.
"you see i've got one in the front room and i had this one put in so then i say if i am in the kitchen, i say, i lift up the receiver, hello, and hear who it is and then i, i say hang on while i get round the chair and then you see i sit on the arm of this chair and talk because er  it's difficult to stand too long."

i'm not getting any sleep .
"i, i maybe fall asleep for maybe an hour or two and then i'm woken and i'm coughing all the time."
and i think it's irritating my hip again you know?

yes.
oh aye.

that funny stuff  you gave me  you gave me?
yes.
well what i've been using is vick and it seems to be burning.
"into me  but it's, i don't know if it's doing me good."
or bad.
now a teaspoonful in the morning.

and two teaspoonsful before you go to your bed.
and that'll get the inside of that sorted out for a wee while again young william.
right.
okay ?
right.
thank you.
eh?
have you got your insurance line alright?
"er i don't know i, i, i don't know when it is."
i think i think it's a few months to go yet.
i don't know.
got a wee while to go.
aye.
it's a year one wasn't it?
oh aye.
six months to go then.
oh.
six months to go eh?
right ho.
right.
see you later.
cheerio now.
cheerio.
check that.
okay that's  on.
er when you .
right okay.
forty three.
that's it on now then.
yes.
well that's when i first started farming.
mhm.
"after i left the council, i worked for the council for ten years and then i stopped the council in nineteen forty six for i i telled you that afore have i."
that's right.
yes.
i couldn't leave them you see with the war on.
mhm.
well then in later years baling came to be a great fashion in orkney here.
mhm.
and er j and w  in kirkwall started to bale hay in orkney but it didn't pay  for you to take  to kirkwall everyday to go to  since the war.
and if it was bad weather he'd to take them home again.
so he asking me if i would do it.
so he gave me a baler and i did all of around about birsay and sanday and  round the area here and baled their hay to them.
and then he bought another baler and he worked with two balers.
"but there was no balers in orkney then , that was the first balers that came here."
aha.
so was that first baler belong to this chap in kirkwall?
j and w .
oh right?
he was the agent you see for for international balers.
i see .
"and he was going to start  old charlie , a very old man."
the grandfather of the people that has it now.
and he wanted to help me to get you see but i wasn't long started farming .
mm.
so then he bought another baler.
well then people started to get balers of their own and er i didn't er get so much work.
but i did the whole of orkney for a while i did everything that could be done.
and then later on combining started.
and er  for the  and then  at rendall took on two new combines from from the massey ferguson company that was  them days.
and they didn't hire with them.
"but the  man who lived at  in rendall, he was going to retire."
so i bought his combine from him.
"so i hired it out to people and work night and day when the weather was bonny, combining their barley and that."
and then i bought another one and then i bought a third one i had three combines but there were no other  combines on orkney .
that was the first of the combines.
but what date it was i couldn't tell you but if you like to mind when  when they first started.
aye.
i think it'd been about nineteen sixty maybe but i'm not sure.
mhm.
so.
"and the and then the the council, they used to cut the roads with scythes you ken, cut the weeds on the roads."
"and i worked for the council so he spoke to me one day and he said, will you cut the roads with a tractor and a mower."
"i says, yes i'll cut them."
"so he  in the paper then asking farmers, anybody had a tractor and a mower if they cut a certain section of the road."
well he didn't get much satisfaction with that for some people wouldn't do it.
"so i said, i'll cut all the roads in the west mainland if you want."
so they took me on and the to cut all the roads from kirkland right to west mainland right out into kirkwall and .
that's the end you see.
some other body did the east mainland.
and i cut the whole roads in three weeks time with a mower.
and i oh it's you see three weeks  to cut the isle of orkney mind.
i wonder how long it takes them now to cut the roads.
and they paid me sixteen and six an hour for the tractor and a mower and myself.
and i started in the morning at eight o'clock and i didn't stop till midnight.
"i did sixteen hours every day, six days a week."
i didn't cut on a sunday.
for i had to stay at home and look after me farm for .
but me wife was good then you see and so was my son and they both worked the farm you see.
and looked after it and i went to do this job for.
it was .
mhm.
was it?
so what happened afore the machinery came in?
did they actually have folk with scythes?
scythes.
aha all cut with scythes.
long ago.
i mind it all cut with scythes.
the the verges?
yes.
the road verges ?
yes.
"see the road verges wasn't the same long ago, it was ditches."
mm.
on the roads.
"but as i told you before, when the council started preparing for hitler, in when i went on the council work in nineteen thirty six i had to fill the ditches in there."
and make verges on the roads.
and they widened the roads and tarmacadamed them.
well they only started tarmacadam in nineteen thirty six.
that's the first they started in orkney.
it was  the road was still there  he had to do it and they were put there by the government.
to be a road surveyor and a travelling foreman.
and peter  was a super foreman.
but he was coming for doing the borders  peebles and selkirk down that and roxburgh.
and  they were they were  you see.
mhm.
at the job.
mhm.
and they took me on in nineteen thirty six to help them you see.
for i was looking for a job i was newly married in nineteen thirty six  make a pound or two.
mhm.
i see.
so how did they work it with the scythes?
was the council chaps employed.
council men  put out with scythes.
yeah.
and a lorry you see to cut the road verges.
mhm.
well they found they could do it far better with a tractor and a mower.
mhm.
and then you see the the council i did that for nineteen years.
and then i stopped farming in nineteen seventy cut it till sixty nine.
well the council started then and they took on machines of their own.
which they work on the same system as a as a rotovator.
and it cuts up the grass in wee bits and er making the roads better it makes them worse.
"for it cuts up the grass like farmyard manure, it chops it up you see and it rots quick and makes the grass grow quicker."
but when i cut the roads it was cut with a finger mower.
and it lay flat and it rotted the grass out.
and it only needed to be cut once a year.
"now when they cuts the roads every week if there was a  watch as you go by, you see them cutting the whole time with a tractor."
the council.
how do you like to hear what it's costing now.
the way was the best way to do it.
mhm.
"and when they cut it with scythes, did they gather it?"
no no they left it lying .
they just left it lying.
yes i rot it out you see.
yeah.
to rot out the grass.
mhm.
"see anybody who cuts their garden with a mower, if you drag the grass off, it doesn't grow so quick."
mhm.
but if you let it lie it manures it you see.
mhm.
till you put it down on a on a field.
mhm.
and that's what's happening with the council you see.
they cut it and chop it up.
mhm.
and makes it small.
mm.
well it rots quick.
that's right.
mhm.
"so when you had your combines, did you did you go round the neighbouring peedie farms."
yes they used to book for cutting you see.
i used to go and cut their barley to them and i bought a thing for drying the barley too.
oh.
a great big leicester thing.
that blowed the moisture it.
oh right.
if you'd anything to put in it you'd blowed the the dampness out you see and dried it.
oh.
what they called a moisture extractor.
i bought it from .
mhm.
a very powerful thing.
you couldn't stand it there was that much power in it.
oh right.
and was it mostly the bigger farms that wanted you.
anybody who wanted combining i did it.
aha.
was it mostly the bigger farms or did the peedie ones.
oh the peedie ones did it  four or five or six acre you cut the  and bag it the barley to them put it in the er the bagger on the machine you see.
mhm.
but in latter days they came with a tank and they put it out and put it in a trailer you see but i just worked with bags when it was the first of it.
oh right.
but you can't get bags now except plastic ones it was all jute bags then.
i worked every day there was weather.
mhm.
if it was a bonny day you worked on till sometimes three in the morning they were doing the .
mhm.
you would work any hours to suit the weather you see.
mhm.
yeah.
and it's never hurt me hard work.
it must have been quite a spectacle though when the first combine came.
oh folk folk came form far and see it.
is that right?
oh yeah.
on a bonny day .
ah.
it would be quite a unusual thing .
"oh it was the first that ever started in orkney, nobody ever thought you see before they used to cut their crop and set it in stokes."
then you used to build it in a stack and then you used to take it in the barn and thresh it.
going with a combine it's all done in one operation you see.
the the barley's in the bag.
mhm.
then you do the  it.
mhm.
and  three great big bins from  from the  they called them and i had three bins in my shed that i stored the barley in and i put the moisture extractor into them and it blew it had wee  in it and it blew all the moisture out.
and when you brought it for your cattle  like the highland parkway making whisky.
mm.
it fermented you see  the cattle was  for it.
oh.
it fermented and made it very sweet.
and it made your dairy cows milk awful good.
oh right.
mhm.
"we worked with dairy , seventy two dairy cows."
mhm.
right.
i suppose the milking machines coming in would have been another.
"they come in in nineteen forty seven , i started dairy in nineteen forty seven."
i shifted to this farm in nineteen forty three but i worked on the council in nineteen forty six.
and then i start dairy work.
well dairy cows.
mhm.
and bought a milking machine.
mm.
used to start to work with the farmers you see but i didn't .
mhm.
and put it in bulk tanks you ken  taking milk away down in a tank i mean we used to take it away in cans.
mhm.
ten gallon cans.
on a lorry.
mhm.
take it into kirkwall.
mhm.
mhm.
mm.
a big change from the from the milking by hand .
oh same as always.
yes.
you know.
i never milked by hand it was always the machine.
yeah .
do you mind seeing folk doing on the.
oh yes er when i was at home as a wee boy everybody milked by hand and give their calves the milk then to drink.
mhm.
"but then later  to suckle their calves, it's less work."
mhm.
everything their doing now is always making less work and that's why there's so much unemployed.
mm.
they're cutting labour you see.
mhm.
"and there's no it doesn't help any for anything's so expensive to buy, the machinery."
mhm.
like a combine now's about thirty or forty thousand.
mhm.
well that's a lot of wages.
mhm.
and they's only used a short time of the year.
mm.
but it's only used in the bonny weather  you see.
i see.
tractors are used for the twelve months you see but not a combine.
mhm.
more worthwhile getting a tractor right enough.
yeah.
yeah.
that's true.
and then when i was was  about the trout fishing in the loch here.
well my my great grandfather came from sanday with his wife and a wee daughter.
and my grandfather married the daughter and he came to .
harray loch and the stenness loch were fishing.
with the tourist trade so they always kept boats you see.
mhm.
so we worked with boats  those lochs for four generations.
and my mother came from the farm along the shore and they were in the same position  they worked with boats too.
and you hired them out to the tourist trade.
"but in them days there wasn't many tourists came to orkney for they didn't have transport, no cars."
but latterly you see there's an awful lot of folks coming and buses on tours and that and the tourist trade on the loch here's busy you know.
there's more folk working  don't make so much money on it.
mhm.
did your father do that when you were peedie farmers  ?
and my grandfather and my great grandfather.
"all did and so did my mother's side, they came from the farm up the up the loch i mean, that's where my mother came from.."
mhm.
what sort of folk was it then?
was it gentry folk coming up for their holidays ?
yes they came for for their holidays.
mhm.
and no they come from all the world and hire boats that people would make .
all over the continent and all over the states and that.
mhm.
aye  show you people you'll see in the loch not last july but the july  came to the states.
mhm.
i can show you photographs of them in the loch here.
mhm.
yeah.
so when you first started hiring out boats was it where did you get your boats from was it.
"well i mean, they were handed down for generations."
our forebears had boats see and you either bought new ones or repaired the ones that was there.
mm.
but my family done that for four generations.
yeah.
on the harray loch and the stenness loch.
that's some while.
it was a while ago.
yeah.
that's some while.
were your boats made by a local boat builder?
well somebody  built them at the boat builders in orkney  built some .
mhm.
"they used to they they started boat building in finstown where the the builders is now you ken, what do you call them."
aye.
"builders, what do you call them?"
erm.
well that's where they started boat building there.
yeah.
at that big shed.
i see.
what do they call that place now?
"erm has the dolphins, that it?"
yes.
yeah.
well that's where they started building boats at .
something  i can't remember what it is.
yeah.
yeah.
i see so that was originally where the boat builders was.
and they came with a  and started there.
mm.
was the name.
and the same firm's working in ayrshire yet.
descendant of them making making boats in ayrshire.
but i get people to the fishing here  asking if the boat's built there.
by .
and all grand boats.
they built awful bonny boats.
but there a  that builds boats  some of them you're in the  builds boats.
mhm.
right.
and i suppose they would be wooden boats would they.
"aye, timber boats but now they're making fibreglass ones but they're not so good in the loch for the the water runs up them quicker they're so smooth."
bodies are made in in planks you see and there's a rib in it.
and it keeps the water from running up them so quick.
mhm.
in windy weather.
when you get strong winds here in the sometimes in the summer.
you get gale force winds sometimes.
mm.
did you fish much yourself then?
"oh yes i always went fishing as a wee boy, me and my brother."
mm.
we used to catch a lot of fish and it was always in them days you  used to catch the trout in the summer  and you used to dry them on the on the dykes and hang them on the line like you could see haddocks and that drying.
you've seen that on south ronaldsay you know.
mhm.
mhm.
we used to dry the trout here.
i suppose trout would be your fish of the summer er.
well  get it aye it was only trout you get in in the harry loch you see.
you'd get a chance salmon.
mm.
yeah.
"what about stenness, do you ever get the sea fish coming  ."
well it used to be  the stenness loch was very good till they built the barriers.
the barriers spoilt it.
is that right?
"yes when the barriers wasn't there you see, the water came right out through hoy and went right out at ."
and kept stromness and kirkwall clear of sewerage.
now you see it's blocked and  good now is at .
or.
mm.
or er hoy.
mm.
so it made the stenness loch polluted for the as pollution comes in the stenness loch and it spoilt the fishing here.
since the barriers was built.
that's my experience of the  happening in my time.
mm.
"do you mind actually, what would you ever get sea fish in stenness loch then ?"
oh it's sea trout you get there.
come from the sea.
would you ever get like  or sillocks .
oh yes you get  sillocks.
mm.
and stenness it's  sea is salt you see.
mhm.
"would you get a mixture, would you ever get the freshwater fish the sea fish ?"
oh yes you get them too.
they come through to the.
aha.
must be kind of it's kind of unusual really.
yeah.
both the sea and the.
well when i was a wee boy the loch had never looked it before the barriers was built  when i was going to school well i was born i started a school at  nineteen eighteen.
well there was a air station at howtown at er stenness then for sea planes landing in the loch.
that was during the the first war.
"and  seen gillies going out for the stenness hotel with sailing boats, i've seen eight leaving there in the morning i went to school."
"all on stenness, they never went to harray for there were plenty of fish in stenness you see."
but now you can fish stenness all dy and you'll never see a fish.
the sewage has spoilt it  whether you can't come it  it's all dirty.
yeah.
yeah.
mhm.
would that be where the local the local sort of gentry tourists stayed then at the stenness hotel ?
"there wasn't  there's no other hotels, one at the  but there's very few hotels then."
mhm.
it was it was called  hotel then.
mhm.
"built it and he built he had the kirkwall hotel, the stenness hotel and the stromness hotel and an hotel in  in shetland."
mm.
"and the hotels he put up, he bought them in glasgow, there'd be an exhibition hotel made of wood, built in glasgow."
he took two of them up here and took them in sections and built one in stenness and another in .
and this  man came from the highlands of scotland.
i remember him finding  going to the school.
his son took over the kirkwall hotel when he grew up.
and his grandson couldn't manage the hotels and him he went away he lived in vancouver and canada a while.
and i don't know if he's living or dead .
that was three  i remember.
er.
so did they just keep the hotel open all year for these visitors?
"no but they didn't use it  for they didn't have a license then, they only got a license after the war you see."
oh i see.
and the same the kirkwall hotel was kept open and the stromness hotel but the stenness hotel was closed.
for they'd no work you see and the staff there was paid off.
for i remember it all shut up.
mm.
they'd no they'd no electric or nothing there you see and they'd water through a well.
mhm.
but then the got the electric and the county water but the the kirkwall hotel and the stromness hotel and the stenness hotel was all connected with the man's own private phone.
he had his own private phone.
for he quarrelled with the telephone people and he put another wire on the other side of the road to himself..
good grief.
he didn't he didn't have a public phone that was a private phone he had.
mm.
i remember  the school.
mm.
heavens.
so the stenness hotel has been up for a while then.
it was up  nineteen five i think for tourists or nineteen three somewhere just after the turn of the century.
heaven sakes.
but i think it was built maybe in er in the er nineteen eighty or early maybe nineteen ninety five or thereabout but it took a while while they got it erected.
and they came from glasgow.
in sections.
and they added onto it and made it bigger since.
mhm.
but the last the first part of it that was built went on fire not long ago.
mhm.
"and it was rebuilt, that's the only part  burnt out."
and it  built of timber.
"which would be why it was such a terrible blaze, it ripped the roof right off ."
yes.
yes it was all timber.
aye.
i remember i remember  first war starting.
oh i see.
so did this fella keep visitors right up through the year or was it just the summer.
not in stenness.
not in stenness.
but in you see travellers and that came stromness  and the kirkwall hotel.
mhm.
and then he used the stenness hotel for visitors but there's not  you got some.
see in them days of the old steam boats and they came from er from leith and aberdeen.
mm.
and then they had to walk.
no cars you see.
i remember people walking .
mm.
pony and gig.
mm.
yeah.
would did the local folk get employment there?
"oh yeah, that's what i'm saying, there's eight people used to go up i've seen eight people leaving the stenness hotel  crofters were around  go round gillying for for the stenness hotel."
i've seen eight boat leaving there with sails on them.
i see.
when i was going to school.
how big would these boats be?
how many folk would they carry?
two folk and the gilly.
there was two folk one each end of the boat and the gilly in the middle.
they boats were anything from ten to twelve feet.
that's the size the boats were  boats  you see.
mhm.
yeah.
that's a  making some of them fourteen feet long now.
mhm.
and i suppose er some of the lasses would have gotten work as.
oh they all got work making food you see waitresses .
and whatever yeah.
and chamber maids.
mhm.
all the local people you see there's nobody goes to work now there's nobody to work.
mm.
"the houses, there's nobody."
yeah.
there used to be big families i've seen  down at  there were six girls there.
we'd have plenty of work for them you see.
mhm.
and did did anybody ever hire out like ponies and gigs for this.
yes  everybody nearly had a pony and gig then.
mhm.
now then you see the motor cars came.
mhm.
my father had a pony and gig.
every family nearly had it.
mhm.
right.
and my father used to gilly in the summertime.
and my brother and my grandfather used to and my great grandfather they all took helped on the loch you see.

"no but i mind it well the power station, i mind it no road there."

for i worked at the council they were trying to make a road there then.

mm.
and he built a new house at  and they call it scott's house yet.
mhm.
and they call the road scott's road.

no it's a wee while to go yet.
they call it scott's road you see.
mm.
"he's a marvellous man, he came to orkney to improve the orkney roads."
"that's  about him and peter , they're two men who could do it."
mhm.
they understood what they were doing.
mhm.
mm.
well there must have been a lot of roads.
you know that they did improve.
well they made an awful lot of new roads since you see.
yeah.
well  if it was a narrow road then they made it twice as wide.
mhm.
i mean you could hardly pass two buses on it then.
mhm.
and the road here was just grassy road  grass road in the middle of it.
mhm.
now it's a  having buses on it.
mhm.
since the war orkney's changed terrible.
mhm.
mm.
yes the amount of machinery and changes in farming and everything it's all just.
yeah.
all the all over really.
mm.
mm.
"what about going right back again, what was what relation of of yours was the the had something to do with breeding horses is that right?"
my my father.
ah.
start the what they call they what did you say the name of it again?
horse breeding.
central horse breeding society.
yeah.
"and then when he gave it up when his wife died, he stopped it then and they changed it into the west mainland horse breeding society."
mhm.
mhm.
"and they used to why they used to work this breeding you see, they used to well some people in the south  stallions they wanted to travel to orkney to make money and advertise them."
mhm.
and they used to call a meeting and this horse breeding society would have called a meeting you know the ones that looked after choosing the horse they were gonna select for this certain season you see.
they started in april and they travelled on till july.
oh.
and was it his job to take the stallion round.
"well the man travelled round the man travelled round with a pony, riding a pony and the stallion walking alongside you see."
and er they like i told you before they used a whole a crafty in kirkwall.
that's where the phoenix is standing right now there was great big piece there and they held a crafty there in the very first  early in april.
and all the people that had stallions  south  been left in orkney all winter somebody had kept them.
they all paraded in there.
on a certain day.
and i used to get in when i was a young boy and see them when i started working on a farm i always to see them.
it was awful interesting to see bonny horse.
mhm.
mhm.
"and then you see they when the crafty was by they used to set out the next day, some  maybe taken for the west mainland and some  taken for  and some were ."
and they went round on their rounds and they called along every eleven days.
why every eleven days?
well that's when your when your mare came in season.
ah.
"and then when you put her in foal,served her with a stallion."
mhm.
"when they served her with a stallion you see, it was three weeks elapsed then before she if you didn't go and foal with that service it was three weeks elapsed afore you game again."
"but if she took the stallion at the end of that three weeks, he came back in another eleven days er she wasn't  settled you see."
i see.
mm.
"and is that when they would say that you know, they had so many good foals the year before or."
"well you see then er say a man owned two stallions here, and he'd two grooms travelling."
"well er they they took so much money when the end of that when they stopped travelling the horse when they was finished the season, they went round all the farms and collected what they call the fairways money."
which maybe be two pound for every mare.
or three pound.
"at the end when the mare proved in foal, you'd pay another three or maybe four pound."
well they went round then the spring and collected all that from the farmers but the men that travelled the stallion went to the house first to see the mare was in foal.
for some farmers would say their mare wasn't in foal you see.
and the grooms went round to make sure she was in foal before he took the money.
and they would collected maybe maybe a hundred and fifty pound for the season for travelling round.
mhm.
mm.
and was that their main wage was that how they got paid ?
"well that's that's that's groom what they call the groom, then he had another job he did in the winter, he  out in the council with the roads or any kind of job like that."
mm.
but he usually travelled the stallion for three month.
mm.
well they started in april.
"april, may, june and july you see."
mhm.
"and some travelled the horse walking it, but some rode a pony."
but in later years they got a gig and it was far easier on the pony you see with a big heavy man riding a pony is awful tiresome on the pony you see.
mhm.
mhm.
and would.
how you got started singing?
how i got started singing?
aye.
"well me, oh, how i got started singing, it was really just  i didn't sing very much really."
my dad was a good singer.
"he wasn't a trained singer or anything, it was, just happened that he, he was a good singer."
my younger brother he's a good singer .
but er.
"did he sing at home, your dad?"
"he just sang round about the house, aha."
"and we just, he knew a lot of the, he was interested in singing and he just knew the words and and just sang round about the house."
mhm.
and he just sang too.
you know that's how he he learnt.
so what were his favourite songs?
"oh dear, he was  what would you say, i don't know  he liked the kind of  ballads, er he was a more a kind of he liked a ballad, so i really couldn't tell you who was his favourite singer or anything like that, just if a song interested him he just."
what do you mean by ballad kind of songs?
"well more the slow, er songs, not the fast."
the love songs and things like that ?
things like that.
mhm.
"but i i never sang anywhere, i just sang round the house ."
mhm.
and it was really er i think it was really the pantomimes that i started singing.
was it?
"here, oh yes."
i never i never went out.
were you were you in the drama clubs here when you were younger then ?
"i was in the  drama club when i was when i stayed at home, but we didn't do pantomimes, we we did plays, one act plays, and three act plays, we did three act plays."
we never did pantomimes.
"and er  but that's the only time, you sang at weddings."
"so i said, come on mabel, sing."
or my father would sing.
so how long did you live in  for?
"we've , into the village, we lived out in the countryside till i was eight, and we come down into the i should say town shouldn't i, we come down into the town when i was eight and i was there till i was twenty two, and i came up here, when i got married."
"mhm, is leslie from this part of the country?"
"les is from  oh well he was, i think he was three when he came up here."
"he lived in, he was born in castle douglas."
mhm.
but i think he was three when his father was came up here to work.
what did his father do when he came here?
"electrician, you know he still worked for the the electricity board ."
did he come with the start of the scheme then really?
"no well it wasn't the scheme he worked on, he would go round and sort your cooker or you know he was that, maintenance, the maintenance side."
"er other thing, and they lived down there opposite the garage, that was the electricity board house then."
so would that be about er the late fifties or something you would you came here then yourself?
i i came here in nineteen sixty one.
sixty one.
mhm.
"that's when i got married, nineteen sixty one, i came up."
what did you think of  when you came ?
"well it was just a quiet wee village just  i had come, wasn't much different it was quiet ."
mhm.
and er there wasn't there wasn't much difference really.
"everybody was very friendly, it didn't matter whether you were an incomer or not, they always spoke."
mhm.
you got to know people  very quick  in .
"that was one thing about the village, and your your neighbour would where jane is the now, i don't think she'll have hardly seen her neighbour in dumfries, but here they were always you know."
you couldn't get them.
oh they were in or out.
so did you do any singing when you came here first?
what was the first kind of thing you got involved in ?
"oh the rural choir, i forgot about that, yes, i joined the rural choir and ."
"and er i couldn't sight read or anything like, i can't sight read."
"but i can remember once when i was at the school mrs  was our music teacher and we were to go from doh to far, you know doh to far, and they used to , she used to say listen to mabel, mabel's the only one one of you that can go from doh to far."
but er  so when we came mrs  the sight reading i was lost because she used to.
is that mrs john ?
no mrs billy.
billy.
she used to take the rural choir.
how long had it been going then when you came?
"oh it had been going for quite some time, i don't know really when they would start."
was it all ladies ?
"mhm, yes, oh aye, all ladies."
"she was nearly retired, billy."
"she was nearly retiring by the, no still the girls go to her at the school so she must have been going for, two or three years after we came up here, but i would be in the choir just, maybe two or three years."
and then it.
and did it.
"it fell the choir fell folded up ,."
folded up and she.
"aye, oh."
retired?
there was nobody else took it on.
was there a church choir going at that time then?
"yes, aye there would be, just the same ladies that have been in it for years."
"but there were men in it for quite a while, i was wondering when that kind of faded out."
oh that was faded out before.
that was a good while before.
aye before we came up here.
"i wonder if, it mr, was it  choir or his father or something that had it, i can if i can remember somebody saying."
so what was going on in the way of entertainments and things like that when you came to  ?
when i came up to live here?
"there was quite a few dances, in er, do you mean dances in the town hall?"
"ah there would be  there well just one or two, not not every week or anything like that as far as i can remember."
just a few over the winter?
"just aye, aye, oh they didn't have them in the in the summer, and in them days well the  the bars shut at ten o'clock which meant you know they came into the dance hall just after that where nowadays the bars shut at twelve o'clock and."
it's hardly worth having a dance .
it's not worth having a dance.
"but i heard the town hall was having one, not the town, was it the town hall or community council having one between, i think it's the town hall, between christmas and new year and really i don't think it's worth their while  having them then."
do you think that's been a big thing contributing to there being a=less dances and things then?
do you mean the bars being oh i think.
and clubs.
i think so really.
do you think it's the main thing ?
"i think that's what's really, it's killed them  as far."
mhm.
as the dances are concerned.
and another thing is the young ones don't dance.
they can.
do you mean by young ones my generation ?
"i mean , yes, well maybe you can but i but the the younger ones are ever er you know younger ones like carl and them, they can disco but they they can't waltz or  er foxtrot or."
how did you learn to waltz then?
"just by going to dances, just by going to dances, we just, you just picked it up, your your partner could do it and you just learnt from there."
mhm.
that's one thing i've always been a quick learner which has been quite.
mhm.
i think jane's got  er that as well.
she seem to be able to pick thing sup.
does she like dancing?
not as not the dancing but when she was working in an office you know they just needed to show her something once and she could pick it up.
mhm.
"it was the same in the the pantomimes when lily has learnt learnt the dancing, i could er after she had showed us about twice i could i could have it no bother and the rest of them were still struggling away trying to learn the steps."
so it's quite an advantage.
so did you go to dances quite before you were married  ?
oh yes in  aye.
was that the place where everybody went to.
to the town hall.
young lads and lasses would get together ?
"lasses would yes, aye, to the dances."
"and they used to run  er buses to different places, you know, you used to go to different places, and ."
and what kind of band played for the dances when you were in  then?
"bands like what tommy has, you know accordion bands."
that er they were all more or less that kind of band.
so by the time you came here it would mostly just be tommy that was playing?
"roundabouts, er the only one i can remember is tommy round about, you know playing er in the hall."
"and , it was just these kind of bands that."
mhm.
"were in those days, the accordion bands."
"so  but we fair enjoyed them , they think, the younger ones don't like them nowadays but."
mhm.
we enjoyed them.
"cos i like, i like the accordion, i like country dancing."
did you go to the country dancing club ?
oh yes.
"went to the country dancing club, used to go all over to the country dances."
oh?
to different places.
"it was supposed to have been quite good up at ,?"
"aye it was , yes it was still going when i came up here."
mhm.
aha.
"was it mrs , from  took it ?"
and were there men went to the country dancing ?
"oh yes , oh yes, aye."
not so many men as went ladies but er.
do you think.
there was a lot of men.
"the rise of the country dancing clubs was maybe be to try and compensate in a way for the dances themselves going down, ordinary dances, folk were wanting to do the scottish dancing and things?"
it could have been but you found.
"you found at the country dancing, it was different people that was at the country dancing than what than what it was at the  more at the the ordinary dances."
folk that maybe would have been shy to go to a.
mhm.
a big dance?
yes er maybe but.
would come to the country dancing.
or some of the older folk maybe that.
"folk, i think yes, it was more, mhm."
right.
but you get country dancing that's very energetic really.
yes.
but i oh i used to go to the country dancing.
so was there a drama club going in  when you came here?
no.
that would be finished up?
"that was finished up, mhm."
"what about the  one, was it still going?"
when you came here?
"i don't think so, i can't remember  eh it going then."
because i think it was tommy that said it was really after the  one finished and there was nothing else round about that there was a gap of a few years and then you got started again here.
"yes, but er it was actually mike  that got it back up here,mike  and grace , john  's first wife that started it up."
"i can remember leslie coming home, i think i must have been expecting doreen at the time, that was in, that was early early on, nineteen, well that was nineteen sixty three, and he was, he had heard that had i had been in the gatehouse drama club, and er he said, would i be interested in in coming to the drama in  if they started?"
leslie said he would need a special part for me then.
but that it took another oh quite a number of years really to get it started up.
they were very good for it's first.
oh the first concert oh yes.
those kind of people.
the i often find that really the first year it was more fun  and er then when they started on the plays and that it got more serious and.
more like hard work really?
"it was really, there wasn't so much fun in it, it was all more serious."
and when bobby  was there it really was.
i remember.
oh yes.
he and andy  together were very good .
"mhm, yes, oh they were, aha."
"bobby was really, he just kept it going really."
sometimes just one person like that or a couple of people ?
"it , it just needs a character really, just to keep it going."
and he really was a character.
"somehow in the drama, it's so long since he passed away ."
there's nobody can replace individual people .
"there no, no, nobody ."
and do you think er the others feel that like you do about doing the plays that it's maybe more of a strain you know the competitions and.
"i think some of them do , yes, i know er some of them have said how much they enjoyed it when it started off first, but er  but now it's just got that wee bit more serious."
"we're with the plays, with going to the festival , you can't,you must be serious when you're practising for something like that ."
"do you feel like it's almost like doing a different thing that you're not, you know when you're actually acting in the play you're more self conscious and you're more conscious of what you're you're moving and you're speaking and whereas the likes of the panto you know you just be yourself really with a bit of fun thrown in ."
"yeah, yes, oh yes aye the plays  the plays you've got to  think what you're doing wand if you miss your cue line you're putting your, the person next, off that it is more  er serious and you've got to think more i think."
mhm.
really.
but however.
"so you just kept kept on singing, after the choir and that finished?"
"aha, when the pantomime started up that was just carried on in there."
"not that i'm a great, good or great singer it's just  i seem to have a strong voice."
unfortunately you can always hear me above everybody else.
oh dear.
"that's, you can."
but if er if folks spoke about you you know they would they would say you were a singer?
"because you're seen and you do sing , there's a lot of people that sing but as you say it's sometimes just in their own homes or they used to but they would never sing ,they used to sing in the choir ."
"yes, sing , no no."
"i've i wouldn't  i don't think i would go out if somebody said, would you come  and sing  er at such and such a thing."
i i don't think i would go.
"but in the pantomime, well you're singing with everybody else, you're not er on your own really."
and the pantomimes a different thing altogether.
mhm.
"and i mun that  i must have words me, if i don't have words me i know it, i i still forget it."
but er.
"that's right, just nerves."
i think it's the nervousness that just knocks the words coming your head.
"oh,."
it's easy to do.
aha.
oh aye.
but er  do you quite like singing for folk that know you?
"do you like singing in the village, where everybody knows you, or would you in some ways be less nervous do you think if you were singing like even to  folk,who just don't  so well ?"
quite know me so well?
do you think that makes any difference?
i think it would really in a way  and yet the people in  know how you sing so the  whereas the  maybe wouldn't know.
mhm.
"and you would  you would be more, you'd be more nervous they they thought, well she's terrible isn't she?"
"but it would also be fresher for them, you know."
oh yes.
folk folk that know you either might be too critical or they might just switch off because they have heard it before .
"they have heard it before, mhm."
but i've never  well i've never really.
you've never.
sang in  anything the pantomime that.
mhm.
"int he village you know, except maybe at  at the  social or something like that, said, come on up and sing and then i forget my words and  that's me."
"do you like to know where, for quite a while in advance what you're going to sing then  ?"
i do really.
"aha, i do really."
if somebody's would if somebody wanted me to sing i really would like to know er because.
do you not have a wee store of your favourite things then that you.
"oh i have a wee store, yes, but you see you don't carry them, i don't carry them with me, if i carried them with me i could sing  i could, well that's it,."
"if you did it more often maybe,."
"i feel if, yes, you would remember them easier."
aha.
but er.
"what, how did how did you collect the songs that you sing then, i mean were they just things that."
"just taking  aye, just songs that i liked and  i just er take them off tapes and, and records, and i just write them down,."
do you do that all the time?
"are you always, when you're hearing something."
mhm.
you're listening.
mhm.
"thinking, oh i'd like to sing that ."
"and i'd like to, aye, and i just  write it down in a  if it's on a tape you can put that pause on and just take line by line, you know."
mhm.
"but erm  and if you listen to the tape long enough you can, i can pick up the tune,."
mhm.
", and just, and have the words."
and then the pianist or the accordionist know the tune i'm alright.
can you take it off the.
mhm.
music though if you had to?
if somebody gave you a bit of sheet music?
no.
no i would have to learn the tune like by listening to the.
aha.
to the person singing.
aha.
"that's the only way i would  learn a tune, i couldn't sight-read the."
mhm.
the music off a sheet.
right.
do you have you ever had a go at the piano or that?
"no, though i would like to have been able to have played, i can remember saying to my mother once, i would like to have been able to have learnt the piano."
and er but they couldn't afford to buy me a piano to learn on so.
mhm.
that was it.
any other instruments.
mhm.
you particularly like?
i that i like?
"or would have, to listen to?"
"to listen to, to listen to, mhm."
"i like the guitar, i like to listen to the guitar, not the classical stuff, i'm sorry to say but, i like to listen to the guitar."
"or er a clarinet, i like the sound of."
"aha, aha."
"oh i like the sound of a clarinet, mhm, i think they're lovely."
but er the piano's the only one i would of like to have learnt to play.
mhm.
i often feel sorry that i never  was able to play but.
oh you still could.
plenty of adverts about .
"yes oh yes, aye ."
practice in the town hall.
"well we had a piano actually, we got it for doreen and doreen  she started to learn, she went to mr ."
remember mr  that used to live at ?
she went to him and then he flitted away.
and er she just never went anywhere else and gave up.
and carol liked to come through and just tinker but she never got lessons or anything so we just sold it.
mhm.
"but, the  music had doh ray mes written on it i could play with one hand but."
mhm.
that i was lost.
"mhm, do you think it's quite good."
mhm.
that they're getting a lot of music at school these days and?
"i think it is, yes, i think it's a great thing really."
do you think it's important?
"yes, erm  i can't give you a reason why i think it's important though."
but i think it is.
i think it's a it's the lighter side of the  their their schooling.
"they have a serious side but they must have a lighter side , mustn't they?"
in the school.
"but you must really enjoy singing to  yourself, you must find that something."
oh i do.
you get singing that you don't get anywhere else.
"its's no, no, i i do enjoy, i i like singing."
i like the music.
i i'm really interested in music.
do you feel you're really expressing something.
"in the music, in the song ."
it's just a simple wee song?
"mhm, mhm, it is, it's lovely ."
"everybody should be able to feel that they can do that, you know?"
aha.
"aye, sure they should."
so is there what kind of things would you like to see  in the village and round about int eh way of more music or less music or a different music?
would you like more dances ?
or ?
"myself, i'd i'd really enjoy dancing, er so does leslie, leslie enjoys dancing ."
but er.
you would go to more it there were more do you think?
"well nowadays i don't know whether you should record this or not, but nowadays erm they'll not go unless they've been to the bar or something before that well unfortunately leslie's not able to drink now, he can't after his operation, he can't take, it just upsets him altogether so he can't go to the bar and all the rest of the company have been to the bar and they're in a different mood than what leslie is, so leslie'll just not go, and it just, it's , cut him off."
mhm.
"there, you know."
that's a shame.
cos it makes a funny humming  or buzzing noise because it picks up the vibrations through the table otherwise.
now then  pen and pencil would  would be a useful idea.
now what did we do before?
"erm we've done  time signatures, compound time signatures."
erm.
yeah  didn't we?
"tonics all that sort of stuff, diminished, augmented."
we did some intervals.
intervals.
yes.
right.
now  can you tell me about time signatures?
"what, what are the two types of time signatures?"
compound.
mhm.
and erm what's the other one?
simple.
simple.
yeah.
just ordinary simple and compound.
and there's.
simple and compound.
yeah.
"compound's things like six nine, six nine erm."
nine twelve.
yeah.
that sort of stuff.
at the top.
that's the top number.
erm.
and compound is three four.
that's that's compound.
now compound is always six.
oh.
"simple is just ordinary three beats a bar,."
yeah.
"four beats in a bar, two beats in a bar."
it's the think of compound as being the one that's more difficult to think about.
"six eight times, nine eight times."
yeah.
right.
"still leaves three two three or four beats in a bar, but they're compound times."
they're dotted beats.
that's really all that compound means.
it means dotted beats.
erm  what would twelve  twelve four?
think about twelve four cos that's a compound time.
it's got twelve at the top.
erm it may help to look at it.
cos you can't think about it .
"think  twelve, and it'll be twelve what?"
dotted semi-quavers.
no.
what does four stand for in an ordinary time signature?
oh crotchets.
right so.
so.
if there are twelve of those.
twelve crotchets.
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve.
think of them in groups of threes  and that gives you four  dotted?
quavers.
no.
semi-quavers.
"you're, you're going small."
yes.
and you've got to go the other way.
oh yeah.
it's erm.
if there are if there are twelve crotchets and each of those are in groups of three.
dotted minims.
so you've got four dotted minims.
"so twelve, i mean if you can remember them twelve stands for four beats in a bar anyway."
yeah.
and  if you just think what twelve crotchets are going to be divided up into.
mm.
it's going to dotted minims.
cos you know it's going to be dotted something or other.
and if you were to see  er an extract of music  here's a twelve eight one.
this one actually tells you it's in twelve eight time.
and it's asking you to put in the bar lines.
where would you  put those bar lines do you think?
it would i think it probably also asks you to  to group them properly.
but just for the moment we won't worry about the grouping aspect.
"i think, assume everything starts on the first beat of the bar ."
okay.
it'll tell you if it doesn't.
erm.
eight stands for ?
quavers.
right.
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve .
so obviously the first one would be there.
and probably if it's going to be a whole one.
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve.
so in fact there are just two bars.
now how would you actually group  those notes?
erm  it'd be groups of three again wouldn't it?
in groups of three.
those two've got to be grouped together.
one two three four.
er  it'd be sort of half of that.
half of the erm crotchet.
i don't know how you do that.
can we go backwards.
one two three four five.
you can only do it if you miss out that.
one two three.
one two three.
and that leaves you with a  a little bit.
right.
yes.
it actually explains it.
exactly what they want you to do.
er where you've got a note that obviously goes over a beat  as in that one there.
yeah.
"you're, you're going to have to write two quavers and tie them."
is that what you said?
yeah.
it might have been what you said .
so those two  okay.
"that one will be joined to a quaver beat, you'll have a group of three."
"and another quaver, those two will be tied  the join taking them onto the next group of three ."
so basically you're splitting this in compound time?
yes.
so it it'd still sound.
"cos that, that actually looks it's the part of the bar too doesn't it?"
"so, and you, you don't actually go over the half."
yeah.
way part of the bar with one single note.
if you've got a note it's got to be held.
you actually split into two and use a tie.
if you're in two time or four time which you are.
you're in four  four dotted  crotchets beats there aren't they?
you will sometimes be asked to  er look at something like that and then put the time signature in.
"these have got the time signature in but you're, they're asking you to put in the bar lines and then grouping the notes properly."
"as in that one, you've you've got to alter what they actually put there."
not going to alter the sound of it.
the sound must still be the same but you've got to alter the notes for grouping purposes.
that may happen in any of those.
"i wonder if they've got any here haven't got  any time signatures, because that's the other thing that they  they like to give you."
down here.
add time signatures.
alright.
let's see what you can make of first of all that one.
"and whether they're all compound, they may not all be compound."
"some may be, some may not."
i don't know.
find the simplest bar  in each one.
this one.
looking through it that is the simplest one cos you can see.
yes.
at a glance there are two.
"it's all, it's all."
groups of three aren't there?
yeah.
so that's obviously going to be in compound time.
what though?
erm.
fairly easy to put in a time signature.
six twelve.
six er  now wait a minute.
what's  four is for crotchets.
eight is for quavers.
"double it again, sixteen."
six sixteen.
it's gonna be sixteen.
so six sixteen.
"and that actually means two dotted two dotted quavers i mean, doesn't it?"
cos each group adds a dotted quaver.
mm.
so it.
yeah.
as you've got here.
that's right.
"in fact, if anything, which is the easiest way round of doing it?"
"to be, if you're asked to put in a time signature?"
it's not always so easy to  to group notes.
i think people find that more difficult than actually saying what a time signature is.
mhm.
what about that one?
erm.
take the simplest bar.
three quavers.
so the time signature is?
erm  three eight.
three eight.
now.
and it's grouped in a dotted crotchet.
yes it is.
now is that compound or is that simple?
three eight is simple.
it's simple because it's just got three at the top.
mm.
it looks it ought to be with the compound ones but it's not.
it's just an ordinary simple one.
"but it's quaver beats crotchet beats, that's all."
"so that was a simple one, that one was a compound one."
we'll do one more.
what about this one?
is there an easy ?
"no they're, they're all, virtually all exactly the same."
erm.
timing aren't they?
they're not quite the same.
two three  four five six.
yeah.
six erm  six four.
yes.
six four which is dotted?
minims.
two dotted minims.
"yes, yes."
two dotted minims in a bar.
that's one of them.
"and that, in fact that's probably the simplest bar isn't it?"
because.
mm.
that's a group of three.
"much the same as a dotted, dotted minim."
erm simple or compound time then?
it's.
six.
six four.
four.
that's simple.
"no, compound."
compound.
"two, three, four or five would be simple times."
"six, twelve  they sound more complicated."
mm.
so think of them as being compound.
right.
that way round then isn't so difficult.
"that i think you  i think most people find it more difficult having to group the notes in the right, in exactly the right way."
so  i think.
this is actually a grade four one.
we'll lead up gradually  to grade five .
yeah.
i'm not going to go all the way back through  grades two and three.
you started on two i think.
or you've got book two.
"we'll go, we'll go from."
i think .
here.
and anything that you find you don't know then we can perhaps go back on just the bits that you don't know.
because you're not going to have to go back on many of the things.
"this book, these books are quite good because they do give you a little bit of explanation."
you've also got er other books or another book at home which you can refer to if you need any extra.
erm it might be an idea to go back.
you won't find you're going to take much time doing some of these.
"if you do exercise one  don't worry about that one, exercise three."
shall i write it down?
"yes, it would be a good idea, wouldn't it?"
mm.
do you want to write on the back of.
it would be  because you've already got some in here haven't you?
i think i probably.
yeah.
actually i'll i'll carry on on.
and the date today is  the.
the twenty  eighth i think.
ah the twenty eighth.
it's the next thing on isn't it ?
"so if you're looking in the grade four book  put down page four, exercise one."
if you have a look at each one of those.
"write them in the book, just put the answers down either on a  on a piece of paper."
you put clearly what it is you're putting in.
then i can just use these books over and over again.
it's pointless writing in them.
"when it comes to exercise three  that's on page five, exercise three."
when it says add bar lines it it won't hurt you to actually write those out.
because.
okay.
you really need to group the notes.
well the notes are grouped but you're gonna add the .
write it out because it's all good practice for.
for you actually.
at er writing out notes .
so  you can do exercise three.
not that one for now because that's doing something different.
now which are the ones that you've got to  to group?
so far  .
right.
page  page eight starts  exercise six.
in fact do  all of those.
do a through to f.
and that's grouping notes  plus the bar lines.
the later ones are always quite hard.
"and they've given you  they've actually given you, not in this one, but they do give you the clefs here."
they've given you the clefs.
did we look at those before?
alto clefs and tenor clefs?
er  don't think so.
have you come across those before?
come across these.
you've come across the treble and the bass right?
"and the bass, not these alto or whatever."
erm if  just take  just think of singers at the moment.
"soprano is the highest, then an alto."
"soprano, then an alto , tenor, bass."
tenor and bass.
soprano is the highest voice.
then comes the alto.
then the tenor and then the bass at the .
oh right.
so is.
so.
that's that's alto.
so is that  one up from.
it's one down from.
the treble.
think of it as being the next lot down if you like.
then there would be a tenor clef and then a bass clef.
"the only reason that, that you're using a different clef is that it's actually putting middle c in a different place."
on the stave.
"an alto doesn't need so many  notes, high notes, but needs a few more lower notes."
so if you just kept your treble clef you'd have a lot of lines possibly that you weren't using .
and having to add a lot of low ledger line notes.
that saves doing that.
because they position middle c.
middle c's actually positioned between those bits there so the middle line there becomes middle c.
which means that you're unlikely to have to have quite so many ledger line notes.
although this has got one or two.
"but not as many as you would have if you were using the treble clef because you'd probably end up with a lot of lower  this is , that isn't a particularly good example really because  it hasn't given a lot of lower notes but normally you'd expect to see more notes down on these  lines."
soprano wouldn't go down that far.
a soprano would only go down to about  erm  oh about what?
"middle c is probably too low for, for most sopranos."
"but an alto would go lower, would go down probably to an f or a g."
these notes would be low.
if that's middle c you can what would the bottom line actually be?
bottom line?
that's c.
er it would.
it's here.
er g.
"c a f, you're right, yes."
erm in fact  a true alto would be using most of the notes there.
and just a few ledger lines above.
unlikely to be using  whereas if they were using the treble clef for most of the time.
f g.
yes.
"and then the other one, the tenor clef."
have they given you a tenor clef?
no.
they'll give you a tenor clef further on.
they may not actually put the tenor clef in till grade  grade five now i come to think about that.
but there's no point in.
not learning it.
about it now because it's  just as easy really.
tenor clef looks exactly the same but middle c is now there.
next line up in fact.
so  because a tenor sings lower  you've got more of the lower notes and fewer of the higher  notes before you need to add  start adding ledger line notes.
"sometimes you'll, they'll still need ledger line notes up there."
and perhaps one down there but  not very likely.
so it's just to make it much more comfortable to look at.
"just means you have to get used to thinking, right if that's  if, if that's er er a tenor clef then that note won't be  it would be, be an a in a bass clef and f in a treble clef."
what will it be for that clef?
in this  erm  oh.
"going downwards going backwards is, is more difficult isn't it?"
yeah.
much easier working upwards from c.
that line's c.
line.
c.
would be?
c a f d.
er c a  e  you go one below it.
oh yeah.
you know f is next in fact c yes.
"that's a, that's f, that would be d so it's between the two which, which is an e."
"and if you were going above , that note would be?"
e.
e and remember that it's the e just above middle c.
and that's the e.
does the middle c.
always come up on a line?
well it's  yes it does in fact.
mm.
i hadn't actually thought of that before.
but yes it does seem to.
i suppose theoretically you could actually move middle c to wherever you wanted to have it.
but generally speaking they they use just the four clefs.
now  certain instruments use the  alto clef.
just a minute.
hello.
oh hello.
alright.
"right i'll fetch him, i'll fetch him."
yes he's here.
oh somewhere he is.
he's just he's just upstairs so i shan't be a moment i'll go and call him .
gosh she's going to have fun with this tape.
go on out you go.
right  yes.
so middle c then can be almost anywhere.
yeah.
what instrument  do you know about  do you think  that uses something the treble clef  and a bass clef?
or have you come across the one that.
erm  instrument that i know.
"well that, that you might know."
"it's not actually a percussion one but it's er  in fact i don't, i think most of the percussion ones tend to use a  a bass clef don't they?"
"yeah, yeah."
if you see one .
yeah or  erm  xylophones  and glocks and those.
except they use treble and bass.
they use the treble don't they?
yes.
er  bass or whatever.
yeah.
xylophone.
"yes, it's a treble."
and a vibraphone?
just   i've got one of those nice little.
yes.
"it's just like a, a small  sort of piano."
doesn't have a very long.
keyboard.
it doesn't i don't think.
quite an.
it's a piano and it's.
odd range.
it's very high.
"because in fact although it's written from there all the way there, erm  that is it starts at the c above middle c and goes up."
yeah.
to very high  the unfortunate thing.
snare drum.
i think that's played  on the bass  what would be on the piano an a.
yes.
"it, it, they."
use certain lines don't they?
they use yeah erm.
"you, you get to know what is."
i think it's er.
what is what.
a is the bass drum.
yeah.
er.
i think it's g they use as the high-hat and there's all sorts of things.
yeah.
i don't thing they  one thing they don't give in this book is a complete score.
yeah.
which  oh do they?
no they don't.
no.
which i'll ask yeah i've got plenty of those sort.
mm.
of things anyway.
you have to know you know for grade five.
"you, you've gotta have quite a wide knowledge."
"you, you don't have to, need to know anything in, in depth but you've got to know."
but you've got to know shallow a wider range.
yes that's right which means in a way that you've got to know quite a lot.
"there's  erm an alto, no, yes an alto clef, isn't it?"
"for  trombone, no, it's not, it's for, yes it's for one of the trombones, isn't it?"
tuba.
oh i erm found out what that  brass instrument we couldn't think of.
what was it?
euphonium.
yes.
you're erm   isn't it silly.
mm.
"i've, i've."
because  you see i could see exactly what you were talking about in my mind.
mm.
but i could not think of its name.
yeah.
i got into the car and i was still erm thinking all about this.
"it's, it's, yeah."
"and my mother said , oh you're thinking of a euphonium."
yeah.
that's the one.
yes.
it's so silly isn't it when er  you know that you knew it all the time.
now then.
"the one i'm looking for is what, have i got to the strings yet?"
no i haven't got back to the strings.
these just use the bass or the treble clef.
and when you get back  to the    there we are.
the strings.
it's the viola that we're actually looking for.
bass violin.
"bass violin, yes ."
there we are.
that's the one that uses it.
you see even in a score it would be written like that.
"so that's the only, only instrument that you generally see, actually see using it  in most, most schools."
unless you're going into some of the tenor  erm  and alto.
"yeah, yeah."
hello.
"well now, what can we do for this lady?"
"well, erm it's  negatives so   x-rays  my leg."
right.
oh.
x-rays.
now then.
back this morning.
okay.
"right, there's no arthritis that's fine."
"but that doesn't mean that you, you know, you won't have pain."
no.
er because there's no arthritis.
aha.
and you still get pains in your joints you don't have arthritis.
er  right.
"but what i was thinking, maybe i'd be better going back to work and seeing how."
mhm.
you know?
"yeah, er i think so."
"the, the one thing about arthritis that  you're better if you can keep going."
"because if you settle, if you, you let the, the joints settle, being nice and smooth, they get all rough  and the other bones knit in."
mm.
with them.
it was just  that pain i was getting.
"it, it seemed, seemed to have disappeared so."
"i thought maybe that  have my work, maybe."
"yeah, that would probably be a good thing."
er more help than anything you know.
"now, the wee pink tablets, did, when you started them, did they make a difference?"
"well, i was actually feeling very sleepy with them."
you felt sleepy with them?
aha.
right.
"well, what, what."
but i've not been taking them for the last week.
"well, keep what you've got in the house,."
aha.
"and if you feel  that the pains are bad during the night, take them at."
take them.
bedtime.
mhm.
right?
"take, keep them round the house,."
mhm.
"if you need them, take them at bedtime."
"but er, i'm glad to say the er x-rays are alright."
"aye, well, i was glad myself ."
oh aye.
"could you date it that i start back monday, doctor, if you don't mind?"
next monday?
er aye well i'm .
"monday that'll be the eighteenth, nineteenth now?"
"er nineteen  four,ninety three."
er  so that gives you another five or ten years before the dry rot sets in.
i hope so.
oh that's good.
oh that's.
i sometimes think it's nature's  wear and tear.
ah!
you've got years and years and years to catch up yet.
years and years and years.
"oh well, i don't suppose i  damage if ."
"yeah, you've a lot of  a lot of capers still to get."
mm.
"there we are, that'll keep you right."
with these folks.
"it's just they like you to, to slip in before you actually start to ."
that means when i go in they know i'm coming in you know?
it keeps them .
"yes, oh aye, that's, that's right."
keeps them  keeps them off your back.
and it.
keeps them off your back.
"right, isobel."
"right doctor, thanks very much."
cheerio.
"okay, cheerio now."
just thinking what we'll start off with.
i think i'll give you some homework that you could do for the week.
so it'll be.
right.
"based on, what we do today will be based on."
okay.
technical names of notes and intervals.
things like that.
"don't, can't remember whether we actually  any of the  technical names of the  of the scale before?"
no.
how many notes are there in a scale?
eight.
right.
so each one of those is going to have a  a name of its own.
yeah.
with the first and last are gonna be called the same thing.
and it's the tonic.
"you, you've probably heard that name before."
tonic.
because i think we've probably.
yeah.
talked about tonic chords and  things like that.
tonic is the first degree of the scale.
so in the key of c major  c will be the tonic.
er now the next note second is called the supertonic.
it's immediately above the tonic.
and so would that be like d?
"that, that would be d."
or in the key of g it would be a.
a.
.
the mediant is the third degree of the scale.
yeah.
"and it's called mediant because it lies exactly between the first note and the fifth note which is also a very important note in the scale, which we'll come to in a minute."
"so mediant is the third and it lies between, it's in the middle in other words."
subdominant  again is the fourth.
and i'll explain why in a moment.
fifth is the dominant.
"it's, it's a very important note."
dominant means that it's important doesn't it?
yeah.
"er and then the submediant, because it lies halfway between the upper tonic the eighth note of the scale and the subdominant."
", that's called the submediant."
"and then the mediant is called the mediant, the mediant because it lies halfway between the tonic and the dominant."
so you've got the mediant between one and five.
submediant between.
between.
eight and four.
and that actually  shows you slightly better.
that little diagram.
"if c is the tonic, g is the dominant, so in the middle comes the mediant."
and think of that as the upper tonic.
and that would be f would be the fourth degree.
so that becomes submediant.
right.
and seventh note is the leading note because it's leading you the tonic again.
"tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant."
the lower dominant in other words and it's.
yeah.
"called subdominant because it's, it's five notes below the upper tonic."
so the dominant is five notes above the tonic and the subdominant is five notes below the tonic.
right.
yeah.
if you like underneath the lower one.
mhm.
"that if, if you can keep the  the descriptions in your mind it just helps you to, to remember why each one is called that."
yeah.
okay and in fact i've given you  part of your homework is to write out the technical names.
"with a very brief explanation of, of why."
and you can use this little book for now.
"i think, i think we've got one of those."
you may have one of these.
at home certainly.
so you can use use that.
can't you?
i'll put the page numbers so you'll be okay there.
the other thing  i'm going to talk about are intervals.
i can't remember whether in grade  it was three you did wasn't it?
yes you've had to do intervals in oral tests.
haven't you?
"so you know things like major second, major thirds."
erm perfect fourths and perfect fifths?
did you have to go as far as that?
no.
no.
no we didn't.
right.
okay.
let's refer back to c major scale because it's the nice easy one.
it's all white notes.
so there's nothing to worry about as far as sharps or flats go.
"there's the, the eight notes of the c major scale."
c to d is a second.
there are two notes involved so we call it a second.
and that's a major second because it comes in a major scale.
"so it's c to d, a major second."
c to e.
c to e major third.
major third.
miss out fourth and fifth for a moment.
go to a.
c to a?
major  sixth.
and c to  b?
b major seventh.
is a seventh.
and then we've got an octave.
right.
the fourths and fifths aren't called major.
"they're called perfect fourth, perfect fifth."
right?
yeah.
the reason for that is because those two notes also come in the minor scale.
alright?
i know the d does but the fourths and the fifths always remain perfect.
okay?
"so you say major second, major third, perfect fourth and fifth, major sixth, major seventh, and octave."
it's actually called a perfect octave but they never worry about the perfect when you're talking about an octave.
but it is actually called a perfect octave .
okay.
besides the major intervals you've got minor intervals.
if you think about c minor scale.
you'd have c d e flat f g.
f g a flat.
a flat.
the key signature actually has a b flat in it but because in a harmonic minor if you remember you raise that.
a semitone that's a b natural going to c.
now you still have a major second but you have a minor third which makes it minor scale doesn't it?
yeah.
and a minor sixth.
but you've still got the perfect fourth and fifth.
you've still got the perfect fourth and the perfect fifth.
right.
"now with all the other intervals you can also have minor seconds, minor sixths and minor sevenths."
which is why they're not called perfects.
you can't have minor fourths and fifths.
so fourths and fifths just remain perfects.
any idea what you do to make all of these other intervals in to a minor interval those two?
what happened to the third to make it a minor?
lowered a semitone.
right.
so if you do the same thing with a d.
erm.
you have c to.
d flat.
d flat.
that becomes a minor second.
right.
there's the minor third with e flat.
fourths and fifths you don't have minors.
you don't have.
right.
now.
that's the sixth.
minor sixth.
the seventh to make it minor you would.
b flat.
put a b flat in.
and that gives you the other minor interval.
"so you've then got a minor second, a third, a sixth and a seventh."
right.
now all of the intervals also have what is called an augmented interval and a diminished interval.
what do you think a diminished interval will do?
to a minor interval.
erm.
"what, what happens if you diminish something?"
you put it down.
right so it gets smaller.
yes.
and if you augment.
something?
it gets bigger.
it gets bigger.
right.
so.
you've taken that down a semitone to  to make it minor.
to make it diminished you just take it down another semitone.
take it down another semitone.
in fact you.
so.
wouldn't hear any difference between that.
so.
yes it's c c.
"and, but you must call it d double flat."
because it.
oh right.
"must have, if it hasn't got another letter name then it's not a second is it?"
yeah.
so c to d double flat.
it'll sound the same note.
so you can only see it on paper.
"you can only, you, you wouldn't know that it  you were hearing  a c to a c, you wouldn't know you were actually hearing a diminished second would you?"
because it's the same note .
right.
what about.
would they would they write it like that in the music?
it would be written like that sometimes if.
it would.
if they're changing key.
yeah.
they might put a double sharp or a double flat that  but would be the same note.
but that's just a way of changing key.
it will actually show up though once you've.
"what about the, what do you think a diminished third is going be?"
a diminished third will be a d.
but you've gotta call it e something otherwise it's a second.
e double flat.
isn't it?
yeah.
okay.
so if you want it to to be a third you've still got to make it an e and call it a double flat.
now you can also have diminished intervals for the fifths and fourths.
fourths and fifths.
alright.
so what do you think a diminished fourth will be from c?
a diminished fourth  would be  diminished f double flat which would be played as an e flat.
now will it?
remember there's no minor interval so you can just go.
oh yes.
straight to an f flat.
f flat.
yeah.
"it'll be, it'll be played as an e but it's actually  actually an f flat."
okay?
as you don't have to go through a minor interval just go one semitone lower and.
yeah.
it becomes diminished for the fourths.
same thing for a fifth.
yeah.
it'd be a g flat.
just an ordinary g flat and that becomes a diminished fifth.
"erm and a  c to, to a."
c to a would be  a double flat which would on a keyboard be a g.
g.
right.
and what about a diminished seventh?
diminished seventh would be played as an a.
and it would be called.
be b double flat.
a b double flat.
that's it.
fine.
"that's, those are the diminished intervals."
what about the augmented intervals?
go up a semitone.
right.
so an augmented second.
second.
will be?
do you have to go through the minor?
no.
because you're getting.
no.
bigger.
oh yeah.
so it's going the other way.
right.
so that would be a d sharp.
a d sharp.
a second.
and a third will be?
it'll be an e sharp.
which will just be played as an f.
yeah.
must be called an e sharp.
then we come to the fourth.
that's the f sharp.
and fifth?
g sharp.
and the sixth?
a sharp.
they're much easier this way round because you haven't got to go through the minor to reach them.
what about a b?
that'd be a b sharp.
which is played as c.
played as c.
so again you wouldn't know you weren't playing an octave.
but on paper you can see that you're intending it as a  an augmented interval.
then you don't have to worry about the octave.
you could actually have  an augmented first.
which would be the  c sharp.
mm.
that's silly.
it's an interval you'd never see but i mean theoretically you could have that.
"the augmented intervals are quite easy because you're only going one semitone greater than what, than the note that appears in the major scale aren't you."
"but to get a diminished interval you've got to remember that if you can have a minor interval, you've got to go one semitone less than that minor interval."
right.
which is two whole semitones less than the major interval.
yeah.
isn't it?
aha.
the fourth and fifth which is easy cos that's just one semitone less.
mm.
they're not really so complicated as perhaps they might look in the first place.
if you.
just keep it clearly in your mind that you can have erm major intervals.
anything that appears in the major scale is a major interval or a perfect fourth and fifth.
okay.
and then you're gonna have a minor interval from each of the major intervals.
a diminished interval from any of the intervals.
yeah.
and an augmented from any of the intervals .
right.
so if you're in the key of  f major.
what's the key signature of f major?
"f major, it's a b flat."
nice easy one to start with.
so there is the tonic.
"let's call it by its proper name, tonic."
tonic.
what would a perfect fourth be?
perfect fourth  it's erm.
first of all letter names.
"it's, it's a c."
that's a fifth.
remember you have.
oh is it?
yeah.
to include the first note.
it's er it's er a b flat.
so it's b flat.
so a perfect fourth is that.
right.
i'll  i'll put the flat the note you can see it.
what about an augmented fifth?
augmented fifth would be a c sharp.
right.
what about a diminished fifth?
"diminished fifth  would be a c flat, a b."
that's right but don't forget it must be.
yeah.
called.
c flat.
c flat.
so that's a diminished one.
minor seventh?
minor seventh is a  b flat.
no a erm a.
that's a fourth.
oh yeah.
well an a.
would be a third but b flat would be a fourth.
b flat.
now you want a seventh remember.
oh you're going from the other.
it's erm  e flat.
e flat that's right.
what about an augmented seventh?
augmented  is erm e sharp.
which would be played as an f.
e sharp.
"what about a  let's have one more, a minor sixth?"
a minor sixth.
that's  erm d flat.
a d flat.
"right  you just have to remember that whatever key you're in, you've got to remember the sharps or flats from that key."
cos those will be the major or perfect.
yeah.
intervals won't they?
and then you've got to add or take away.
er if you er if you had to have an augmented fourth  what would you do?
augmented fourth.
"it would put it up a semitone, so it would be a normal b."
a normal b.
if you had a key signature you would have to remember to make that a natural wouldn't you?
yeah.
but if it's got no key signature you wouldn't need to bother to put anything in .
cos inevitably it would just be a  a diminished  fourth.
right.
"the other part of your homework i've given you to do, is to write down all of the intervals that you can possibly have."
but based on the key of g.
"i gave them all to you based on the key of, of c now."
c.
but if you write them all  down first of all starting with c.
and then going to d which would be the major second.
.
"i've put major second, minor second, diminished second, augmented second."
.
and then the third and then the third and a fourth and a fifth all the way through.
erm.
if you get used to writing those out.
and then the next time i'll probably give you some intervals and ask you what they are.
i'll actually start writing out  things for you to do as homework.
and i've also got a book that we can use.
i've got grade four and grade five which are quite useful.
but i find it more useful actually to write out  the things i want you to actually do.
er.
and then i shall find out quite quickly what you don't understand.
so what we've got to spend more time on.
what you do understand so we won't bother to spend as much time on.
cos there are quite a lot of other things that we've gotta deal with.
in fact we've got to deal with everything that comes in this particular book.
and there's quite a lot of it.
"the other one of the, one of the things that people find very difficult, the learning all the words they expect you to know."
the italian terms.
and the french terms now they've added.
and some german ones.
and there are pages of them.
quite a number of pages.
what sort of things?
"like erm all, all those different speeds."
yes.
erm.
"allegro, andante, everything."
"and  they do actually now add, they only used to give you italian terms, they've now added quite a lot of the french ones and the german ones."
i can never remember the german ones.
french ones i don't have any trouble with.
most of the italian ones i don't have any trouble with.
but i can not remember the german ones.
but i've never had to use them.
you might find those easier.
do you do german at school?
yeah i do.
i do french and german.
you'll probably find you won't have quite as much trouble as i do with them .
"but i've never had to worry about them so i, i've never really got on and learnt them."
"that's, that's what it boils down to."
and there are a lot of them.
"you know they're all things that you, they expect you to know."
and they do ask you questions on  quite a lot of them.
and there are pages of them to learn.
er.
you've got to know quite a lot about rhythm.
"all the different time signatures that there are, which will include everything."
two four three four.
two four three four.
four four.
yes.
which is the  crotchets.
"then you've got  erm six eight things like that, where it's quavers."
six eight you've got to be careful with because you're in to a different type of time.
erm.
and you go one one two three four five six.
and those are what we call compound time.
yes.
erm.
"it's, it's the same time as three four."
you have you have two types of time.
but you count the quavers the crotchets.
it's not quite like that actually.
six eight time is actually two time.
but the beats are divided  or shared out into three.
oh it's in triplets.
er they're not actually triplets no.
oh.
"they're, they're, they're six to tell you you have six quavers in a bar."
it's true.
but they're in two groups of three.
like that.
and what it actually means if you see them like that it actually means that there are two  beats in a bar and they're dotted beats.
oh right.
er two beats in a bar that are not dotted.
just.
and that's just called two four.
"that's two time, two dotted beats in a bar."
it's called compound time because they're not beats that can be divided into two.
they go into three you see.
if you have nine eight it's the same thing as saying three beats in a bar.
three beats in a bar.
"but they're three dotted crotchet beats, or nine quavers in a bar."
and they're grouped in threes.
the compound time is grouped in threes.
the ordinary simple time grouped in twos or the beats can be divided into twos.
what's divide actually means in twos is that you share it.
mm.
equally if you divide something.
erm you can also have six four time.
what do you think six four time might mean?
six four.
erm  it's.
well there are gonna be six somethings.
yeah.
in the bar.
it's.
six what?
what does the four stand for?
it's crotchets.
six crotchets.
right.
so.
"let's write it down and you can see, six, there are six crotchets in a bar."
now remember if it's got six at the top it means it's in two time.
so divide that bar into two and then make each one of those into a dotted beat.
and what do you get?
erm.
you could make a dotted something that group of three notes.
mm.
yeah.
erm you have  what is it?
a dotted  now that was a dotted  those three notes were a dotted crotchet.
yeah.
so three so three crotchets will become one dotted?
minim.
minim.
so six four time means two dotted minim beats in every bar.
right.
so it's two time.
what about nine eight or nine four?
nine four we'd better do hadn't we?
nine four.
"it's erm  nine, it's nine."
for crotchets.
nine crotchets.
or three?
or three  dotted minims.
dotted minims in a bar.
these are the things people get very confused about.
that there are two basic different types of time.
compound time.
simple time.
"these are the compound ones the six eights, nine eights, six fours, nine fours, twelve."
you can have twelve .
twelve is four beats in a bar.
you can also get it with twos can't you?
so you'd have like four two which would be.
"you could, yes you could do."
minims.
do you get it with semibreves?
no.
it's unlikely.
no.
"i suppose theoretically again you could have but it's, it's not a."
yeah.
not a usual one cos that would make a very.
yeah.
very long bar and.
eight.
er but you can definitely have  you can have six sixteen if you wanted.
nine sixteen.
six sixteen would be what?
erm it would be.
six what.
semiquavers.
six semiquavers.
in other words two dotted quavers.
yeah.
in a bar.
what would be the equivalent simple time signature to that?
the equivalent simple  erm.
remember six means.
yeah.
it's two.
two beats in a bar.
so we know the top number's gotta be two.
two.
it's two four.
erm.
erm no.
oh.
just two quavers in a bar.
two quavers.
which is two?
two eight.
eight.
"having two dotted quavers, two ordinary quavers would be eight."
"it's not a time signature you see very often but again you can, you could have it."
right.
or that one would be three four wouldn't it?
and that one would be three two.
three minims in a bar.
three over two.
"we'll go into those in a lot more detail when, when the time comes."
"but  if you can, if you can understand the difference between simple time and the compound time and er try not to muddle the fact that six eight does not mean that there are six quaver beats in a bar, but it means that there are two dotted beats, and two dotted crotchet beats in a bar  and try and get that into your head you can you're gonna find it easier."
"so many people find it very very difficult, to sort out the difference between simple times and compound times."
"if you could basically remember that there are two beats, three beats in a bar, four beats in a bar, five beats in a bar, whatever."
"but even in compound time you still have two beats in a bar, three beats in a bar, four beats in a bar."
but they're dotted beats.
simple time which is ordinary single  beats.
erm  you'll have plenty of opportunity of writing them down and erm you'll be given a lot of extracts of music like you probably were in that book.
mm.
and asked to put the time signature in.
"they get more complicated  don't they once you've got compound times, and, simple times."
"and that one had bar lines,."
which is the same sort of thing.
you've got to know what the time.
yeah.
signature means haven't you?
yes.
"well i was born, born at  in nineteen eleven."
so it's quite a long while ago and i've travelled round quite since then.
my father was a methodist minister.
"so we moved round every three or at the most four years, and er we we've been up in scotland and er yorkshire, lancashire, and down east anglia."
"and er it wasn't until he came a, er in the skegness circuit when i was eighteen that's when i started nursing."
and erm i i came to  in the first place because it was the best teaching hospital in the midlands at that time.
"and er it was near home as well so i, i should be able to get home for days off."
"that was the, the main thing."
"oh was that, that was nice."
erm could you tell me about your father being a methodist minister?
"he was, was he just moved on , or were they voluntary moves?"
"no er in the methodist er circuits they move them on, they're, they're invited for three years."
least they were at that time.
"and then at the end of the three years you were either invited to stay an, an extra year or you were, you were er you had an invitation from some other circuit."
to go there.
they used to send the stewards round and er you'd suddenly see two new people in the congregation and they'd  come to hear the minister preach to see if he was a good preacher and then they'd go back to report.
and then he would either have an official invitation or should hear no more about it .
but that was very difficult from the children's point of view.
"there were, there were two erm boarding schools for methodist ministers' children."
there was  for boys and  for girls.
er and you could go to a boarding school but if you didn't you were moved round every three or four years at the most to a different school.
er and my brother went to a boarding school but i didn't.
"and i've, it was always a big handicap because the syllabuses at different schools were different."
you'd go to a school where they'd been doing french or latin for two or three years and you hadn't done any .
it was very very difficult.
"so i, i can't really say my school days were the happiest days, they certainly weren't."
mm.
was there any reason why your brother was sent to a boarding school but you weren't?
well not really.
boys in those days they were always given the best education.
"girls it wasn't nearly so important that they should be er er and also i, i don't  think my parents thought i was really worth educating ."
they didn't think i was very bright or very brainy.
i was a very er quiet child and er very little self confidence.
i think that was a lot of it.
"and they didn't expect very much of me from my school reports and i thought, well if they didn't expect i you know i wasn't capable of it."
"and it wasn't really until i left school and er went into nursing that i thought, now this is something i'm starting on even with everybody else."
"er and something i really wanted to do, and really enjoyed."
"that's where i, i really started in and showed what i was made of."
"i could come out top in my exams then when i never did at school, i never did anything much at school ."
do you think this was er special to your family that you were treated as you weren't a brainy one or do you think that was the way girls were generally treated?
"i, i think it was largely the way most girls were treated."
"you know it was just the sort of  it, it all changed after the first world war and completely changed after the second world war."
"before then you, you were , you were a girl."
you stayed at home and helped in the home until you were old enough.
then you got married then and that was sort of the sum total of it.
"and it wasn't really until after the first world war when things really er got started and er women carried on and, and they do take jobs and occupations er that they really came into their own."
and certainly during the second world war where they kept things going and could prove that they were as  good as any man .
"but even  until ooh when, i, i can remember my daughter when she er was going to university."
"there were certain subjects that they said, keep off, because it doesn't matter how clever you are."
it doesn't matter how good a degree you get.
it will go for nothing.
"if a man applies and he, he hasn't got as good qualifications as as you've got, you won't have a, stand an earthly."
the man will always get the job.
"well that has changed a lot now and i think it it, it is a good thing ."
do you think you were conscious as a child at the difference between the way your brother was treated and the way yourself?
no.
i think i just accepted it.
he was younger than i was.
"er he was a delicate baby and i was always the sturdy one and i was always expected to give in to him and coddle him he, he, he was always put first."
i never minded .
no.
it didn't bother me.
i think most people were the same in those days.
did you have to help around the house when you were a child?
not .
"we, we were expected, we did, we were expected to keep our own rooms tidy."
"and make our own beds but  not, not ."
"you see in those days people servants were so  you could get servants so easily you didn't have somebody living in er you, you'd have a daily person."
they saw to all the washing up.
er and that sort of thing.
but no we weren't expected to do a lot in the house.
mm.
"so did you generally have a, a daily lady to come and help or."
yes.
we did.
when we were about nine and ten and a half we had somebody living in because there were an awful lot of evening meetings that my father had to go to and usually mother went with him.
"which meant we'd always got somebody in the house, baby-sitting really."
"that, that's her main, she used to look after things and baby-sit for us in the evenings."
have you got any particular memories of your earliest childhood?
not .
"i, i can remember we were at  in lancashire."
"that was during the first world war, i should be i suppose about five then."
er we er my father was chaplain to a big military hospital there.
and it was always open house and the nurses used to come in when they were off duty a lot.
"and oh the, the soldiers, the wounded soldiers, they used to come ."
you could always tell who they were.
they had er er rather pretty blue er suits they used to wear with white shirts and red ties.
"you could always tell they were, they were er they'd been wounded and, and they were in hospital by their dress."
and they used to come in a lot.
and i think we were made quite a fuss of too.
"er and i, i don't know whether that was where i got my first idea of being a nurse."
i never wanted to be anything else but a nurse.
it was the one thing i always wanted to do.
"i never wanted to do anything, it never entered my head to do anything else."
"er so whether i unconsciously got it from there, i, i don't really know, i may have done."
yes.
were there any other family influences in this line?
"i know on your wall here you, you have a lovely portrait of your grandfather and grandmother."
"yes, yes."
"they influenced my life a, a lot."
my mother died when i'd be about eleven.
and er course summer holidays we always used to go and spend them with granny and granddad.
they had retired and they lived down at lowestoft so it was a lovely place to go for summer holidays.
and we always used to go there.
"er and they did, they influenced, they influenced er me a lot, a lot really and i suppose they did my brother ."
"but er we, we could always ask granddad if we wanted to know anything."
"how babies were born or, or anything."
we always go and ask granddad.
"and he'd never tell us, he, he'd never, he'd always tell us as much as he thought we could accept."
"he was very modern really for his age,for er the time he lived in really."
cos in those days they didn't.
i mean it just wasn't talked about.
"you, you, you, you, girls used to get married in those days, and they were extremely innocent, they'd really no idea ."
"and when i look back and er and think of i first started nursing a lot of the girls we used to get in, they thought if they kissed a man they were going to have a baby."
they were very innocent.
but er  things have changed a lot these days .
yes.
what kind of job did your grandfather do?
"ah he was a, he was a headmaster at a methodist school at  in yorkshire."
"and er he'd worked his way up as a teacher, then he, he was a headmaster."
"and even then i, i would have thought he, he was very up to date."
"he used to have very definite ideas of, of er how to treat children."
i don't know whether the psychiatrists would have agreed with him.
"but i know i could remember being taken round his school and in the main hall he'd got a glass fronted cupboard, and he'd got all sorts of well really and truly they were just pretty pebbles."
i don't think they were anything much more than that.
"but they were all for certain things and i, i, i remember one er was for anybody who stuttered."
"and he'd got a boy who did stutter and he always used to go to granddad before er he when he came to school, before lessons and he'd give him this pebble and he'd say, now you can put it in your pocket."
"but always hold it, keep it and if you're holding that stone you won't stutter."
and he didn't.
and he got so he could gradually do without it and he never stuttered again.
most  amazing thing .
did he.
"probably, you know, lack of self confidence or something like that."
but it did the trick.
yes.
did he have other pebbles er which had other cures?
was this what the pebbles were for?
he may have done.
"i really don't know, but i do remember that one."
"i remember him telling me about that, that stone."
mm.
you said that your grandmother played quite a part in your upbringing after your mother died.
"yes, yes."
well she taught me to knit and she taught me to do a lot of embroidery and that sort of thing.
"she did certainly influence me in, in that way."
"but erm i still do, i still do a lot of knitting."
"i can't do any embroidery nowadays but i do, i i'm never er i've never er stopped enjoying knitting."
it's always been a hobby with me.
and then she did a lot of tatting.
you don't hear that these days.
"erm and we never knew how she did it, she never had told anybody how she did it, it died with her i'm afraid."
"but everything she, everything she did always had some embroidery on."
she never did anything just plain.
"it was amazing really and even, she was eighty two when she died and even then she was knitting her own jumper suits."
and embroidery.
even the canary cover had an embroidery  on it.
it was amazing .
she'd nothing everything she did she had to beautify it and put some embroidery on it.
"i, i take it that she didn't have a job ."
no.
no.
no.
in those days women didn't seem to take part time jobs or jobs .
"i think if they did anything it, it was sort of charity work."
er and they did a lot of sewing for bazaars at church and that sort of thing.
"but er i don't really remember erm people going out to work much except, i suppose you'd call them the lower classes, or not really the working classes because er, but the lower classes they would take in washing."
er or they'd go out charring and go you know we used to have a woman come in once a week to do the washing.
"she'd come in and do the washing in the morning, and if it was a nice bright day she'd iron in the afternoon."
for the whole family.
"er and other er women would you know you'd take it to them and they'd do it in, in their own homes."
and it would come back already done.
"but that i don't think, women didn't do much i mean even in shops, the men were the shop assistants nearly always."
"so you didn't get women going out, nothing like, not like they do these days."
"and when you went to school, can you remember what that was like?"
well i was never very happy at school.
i never seemed to be  the other scholars .
"but er it was, the discipline was very much stricter than it is er today."
er nowadays so many things are just accepted that in those days they wouldn't be.
"i can remember one, one girl, i mean the great sin was to steal anything, and er they'd found in her, her satchel somebody else's pencil."
now whether it had got there by mistake we never knew but there was no question she was absolutely just dismissed on the spot.
sent home and that was it.
but er any pinching or anything like that ooh it was erm it just wasn't accepted .
it was a terrible crime.
whereas now i mean it's a case of if you lose anything it's your own fault for putting it down.
"it's, it's a terrible  state of affairs really."
it's not improved .
and the discipline in the classroom er it was very strict.
there was never any talking in class.
"i mean it was, you, you were sent the room."
did you as children think that that was fair?
oh yes we did.
"yes, we went to school to learn and we were told not to talk."
"if we talked well we, we expected it."
"er there wasn't anything like the, well not to the schools that i went to, the corporal punishment that there seems to have been since."
er it i don't ever remember anyone you know getting the cane or anything like that.
"we did have lines, hundred lines, i must not do this or something like that which was very negative really."
be far better if they told us to do something sensible .
but er it took your time up when you know when you might have been enjoying yourself.
"but, but erm no we expected, we accepted the, the discipline."
"we were told not to do a thing, if we did it well you, you knew what you were up against."
er i think far more than they do now.
they don't seem to take notice of what the teachers said.
"er and i think perhaps teaching i don't know whether it's different today but they seemed to instil in us the love of, of poetry and the, the love of literature and that sort of thing."
"i've always been grateful for that, that they did you know create this love of poetry."
i've never lost it.
"and i still like a lot of the, the classics and the good, the good english."
"but er nowadays they , i don't know, it's different."
did you have the variety of subjects that children have today?
er well i suppose we did but they were different.
"i er we, we had latin and french mainly."
"erm then we had all the usual maths and english, erm history and geography."
"er i think we learnt it probably in different ways, we learnt it more parrot fashion than they do today."
"but i, i mean when it comes to times tables that sort of thing i've never been sorry i learnt those."
i think a lot of schools do still teach the the children their tables which i think is a good thing.
you never forget them.
but erm there was not the handicrafts.
"you, you were taught plain sewing and that sort of thing but that was about all."
to hem and and to seam.
"but erm not, not the handicrafts that they teach them now at school."
i i should think really and truly er schooling today is more fun than it was.
"we'd, it was very serious in our day but now it's much more fun."
they enjoy it more.
they do all sorts of erm projects that we never did.
er were the boys taught different things from the girls in some subjects?
yes.
"they, i mean carpentry, they had carpentry."
only boys did it and cookery only the girls that did it.
"er you, you got a basic idea of cookery."
"and, and needlework, but erm they were mainly the, i suppose they were giving you a good er grounding as they'd call it in those days."
mm.
er can you remember when you were a small child erm what sort of things you did at playtime at school?
the kind of games you played?
"well i suppose we, yes we used to have erm hopscotch,different seasons."
"i can't remember the seasons now, the different seasons brought out different games."
"there was hopscotch, er and then everybody would start with hoops."
"you couldn't do that  these days, the traffic's too bad  but we used to have wooden hoops or we'd have er iron hoops."
"er and then skipping ropes, that was another thing."
"er they, there were seasons for all these things and then erm balls, we used to used to play balls up against the walls."
"er but er oh and tops, that were another thing."
"yes, spinning tops."
with whips.
"we used to, there used to be little wooden tops."
and then we used to make crayon patterns of the top and then when they went whizzing round they used to look very pretty.
and we used to see who could keep them going the longest.
and did both boys and girls play these games?
"they,yes."
erm tops.
"girls mainly skipping, i don't remember ever seeing any boys skipping."
the girls usually had the wooden hoops and the boys the iron hoops.
"erm but that yes, they didn't,they'd play more a sort of football, the boys would."
"we'd play just with ordinary er sort of tennis ball size, that type of ball."
"but that, yes we did more or less all play the same games."
and we used to have long skipping ropes too.
we used to be er almost like a erm a clothes line.
"you used to go sort of right into the road, almost across the road, a side road."
"and you'd have two turning, one each end, and you'd get four, five, or even six people all skipping in the middle."
at the same time.
yes.
can you tell me about your brother?
what did your brother go on to do later?
"er well he, he went, he, he went er he was erm for quite a while he was er he had chow dogs."
"he was breeding chow dogs and then he went erm er he went to a poultry farm, for a time."
"and then when the war came he er he was one of the first bevan boys that, one of the boys that went down the mines to relieve the miners."
"er well that didn't last very long, he wasn't really cut out for that sort of thing ."
"he, he, he was more of a scholastic type."
then he went in for er for teaching afterwards.
"er and then he, he went to singapore, he was there for quite a long while after the war teaching the er the english children."
they didn't mix in those days.
the english were taught in a different school to the chinese.
so he was teaching there and then he came back.
"er he's retired now, but he was teaching in an english school for a while."
could you tell me about when he became a bevan boy?
was that something he volunteered for?
"well er i, well yes."
"they were given a choice er either i, i think it was either you go on the land or er you, you go down the mines."
and he decided he'd try down the mines.
but it was very hard work.
"it, it was, it was alright for people who were used to that sort of thing but i mean they hadn't all the mechanization in the mines then that they have now."
"it was really very hard work and he used to come back absolutely smothered in coal dust, very dirty."
so i think he was down for about six months before he left.
where was that?
"er do you know, i don't know."
"it'd be in one of the, the  pits."
i don't remember which one it was.
"he was married by that time and erm living down at  but i don't think it, it would be fairly near there."
it wouldn't be too far out.
can we turn now then to your own career?
"you'd decided to go into nursing, and you've said you'd always wanted."
mm.
yes.
to go into nursing.
so how did you.
mm.
eventually start in nursing?
"well it, it certainly never entered my head to do anything else and although several other things were suggested er i never er i never even considered them."
"er even the headmaster said, he tried to put me off."
"he said, oh you know it's very hard work."
"you have to clean a lot of brasses, but i mean i wasn't gonna be put off."
"and it was er it, it, when i, i was eighteen in the march."
and i started at the  general hospital er in on may the first nineteen twenty nine.
so.
why why do you think people were trying to put you off?
i don't think they thought i was cut out or suitable for nursing.
i don't  i don't know why they shouldn't .
"but whether they thought it was going to be too hard work, and, and it certainly was very hard work."
"but if you are doing something you, you like and want and enjoy doing er you, you don't mind working hard, ."
but it was very hard work.
and it was very very poorly paid.
"we got er we, well after the first three months, the first three months we, we were what they call student nurses."
"er it was mainly lectures on erm hygiene, and biology,and that type of thing."
"and er then we erm we, we, we went on the wards for about two or three hours a day and we just did what we were told, took out drinks and, and that sort of thing, and mouthwashes, and after er we'd been there for about six or eight weeks we were allowed to wash patients, if, if they couldn't wash themselves."
"this type of thing until the, after the three months we had to pass an exam."
and if we passed the exam then we became er er probationer nurses then.
"and started on the, on the wards."
we started at seven in the morning and we finished at eight at night.
"and we had er two hours off during the day, er and twenty minutes for dinner and er about twenty minutes for tea."
so we didn't get very much time off and by the time we got back to our rooms at night we were so terribly tired you just dropped into bed.
"i don't think i've ever been so tired before or since as i was just that, that first year when we were probationer nurses."
we were on our feet the whole time.
"it, we never slackened off and in those days there was so much brass to be cleaned and scrubbing to be done and cleaning."
"everything was er so much more difficult than it, than it is today and er things were not disposed of like they are now."
"they, they were all sterilized, thoroughly washed, and then sterilized in, in the sterilizer, boiled in the sterilizer."
"and i and i don't know whether they still have the wooden lockers now but they used to be, have to be all scrubbed out every week."
the outside polished.
"er it, it was very hard work."
there's no getting it.
"and when you were pros you did, you got all the  mucky jobs to do ."
they always used to call us mucky little pros.
"and for all for er for that er you got, you, you well you got your keep er and i don't really think there was anything wrong with the food, it was the way it was cooked."
it was terribly badly cooked.
and you just could not manage on the food that was provided.
"you either got tuck boxes from home or you had to supplement it with your own earnings, which, ten shillings a week."
we got two pounds a month.
"and that you had to keep yourself in stockings, er and shoes for the ward."
"er and you, you, you provided yourself with the uniform before you came as a student nurse so that was alright for the first year, so you'd no uniform to provide."
but er i often wonder what the nurses today would think if they  if that's all they they got .
i know money did go much farther in those days but there certainly wasn't very much to spare .
erm.
you kept so busy it seems a waste of time to ask you what your social life was like  as a student nurse ?
it was nil.
absolutely.
there was never any time .
"and you got into your second years you did get erm two hours off one day and three hours the next, which was usually five till eight."
but you had to be in by eight o'clock.
so er i mean it wasn't much good if you wanted to go out with anybody.
"say, well i'm awfully sorry i'm off at five but i got to be back at eight."
"it , no, no."
"it was absolutely, it wasn't, it was absolutely no social life ."
"if you were lucky er and you had friends in , you could go out for tea and, and that's about all there was."
and on the sunday well you'd go to church or chapel because literally there was nothing else to do.
there was nothing going on in the centre of .
it was absolutely dead.
you couldn't get a cup of tea or a cup of coffee anywhere.
"no theatres open, no pictures open, no coffee bars."
absolutely nothing.
it was as dead as anything.
were all the student nurses about the same age?
yes.
"occasionally you got somebody who was older but  no we were nearly always, i don't think anyone much older  could have stood the pace actually ."
er we did have one person who was in her early twenties but er she gave it up.
"er you know she couldn't stick it, she, she gave it up, it was too hard work."
and do you think they all came from the same kind of background as yourself or were they more working people?
.
"no, i think they were a real mixture."
er er they came from a good old cross section of life.
"i i still even now occasionally see one or two that we, we all started together."
"we still keep up, we hear from at christmas time."
"but erm no there were, there were all sorts er there was, they used to come in from the country."
er there was a stationmaster's daughter there i remember.
"erm no, no, we were a good old cross section i think really."
"in those days you know it, it was a vocation."
you  certainly didn't do it for the money .
"er you, you did it because you really wanted to and it, it, it was a satisfying job."
"and that's what i think it, it's, i'm wondering now if the nurses today get the satisfaction from the job that we got in those early days."
"it was very hard work but you felt, well i've done a good day's work when you'd finished."
"because when you were on night duty, which you, you did, er it was a twelve hour stint right through from eight at night till eight in the morning."
"and course you, the half an hour for a meal in the middle of the night er that was it you got no time off ."
so erm.
where do you think your satisfaction came from in the job?
well i suppose you the patients were very very grateful for anything that you did.
we did get them  better a lot of them at any rate .
"er and i think there there was that satisfaction that you, you were doing something to help people get better."
"and they'd, they'd come in for surgery and you know you'd nurse them back again."
get them up on their feet.
and there was a satisfaction about it although i always think in those days we had to work so fast that there wasn't the time to do what you'd really like to have done for the patients.
"it was a case of, i mean we used to start and wash them at three o'clock in the morning because you had to start then because you'd never get it all done."
you had to get everything done by the day staff coming on at seven.
"er and if you didn't start at that early hour you'd, you'd, you'd never, they used to get, sit up in bed, have a wash,then lie down again and go to sleep ."
"i mean i don't think they do, they do that these days, i hope not  any rate ."
"but you just had to do that sort of thing, i, we used to feel awfully sorry for the patients but you had, they had do it because they wouldn't have got a wash otherwise, there was so so much to do."
i don't suppose the unions would put up with it these days but er there weren't such things as unions for nurses in those days.
was there nothing that even the full er fully trained nurses could join?
no union?
"well,just towards the end of my training there, there, there was the er college of nursing started."
"really started to look into the, the, the the, the er profession and also to see if they couldn't improve the lot of nurses."
"and now a large number of, of nurses, certainly the older ones do belong to the er college of nursing, were members of that."
"we, i was in it, we, i think we paid a shilling a week, a five p a er a, a five p a month to belong to it."
"erm so we didn't pay very very much but they certainly had, they did, er they tried to standardize the, the nurses."
"because even in those days er it, it wasn't, there'd be good training hospitals and not so good."
"now, nowadays a good training hospital will, will want er a number of o levels and preferably two or even three a levels before they would accept a student."
"er standards have gone up, there's no doubt about that."
but erm.
did you have to have any particular qualifications when you started?
they liked us to have what in those days was the matric.
and if you had the matric yes well it did help you to get in.
"er you, you a lot of them people did apply but er they just didn't you know they didn't get in."
"they didn't, what it was they didn't consider that people were suitable to become a nurse."
i think that's what it was.
"but that, yeah they did like you to have your matric."
"i, i did have it and erm that was a help."
"the standard, standard of, of exams were pretty high, there's no getting that they were pretty high."
"because you'd , they, they'd go up and then if, if you went any farther you'd go the doctors' lectures you see."
so they were pretty high in those days.
now it was the general hospital in  where you did your training.
"that's it, yes."
"erm, can you remember what it was like generally facilities?"
erm it wasn't too bad.
"we had our own bedrooms and that was saying quite , because er the, the nurses home had been built er for the er as a sort of war memorial for after the first world war which was  one of the most sensible war memorials i think anyone could have er provided ."
"and we all had er our own bedrooms, which was nice."
"they weren't very big, but er they'd got a wardrobe, a a single bed and er dressing table and drawers."
"er and then we had about, ooh there'd be about ooh twenty of us to four bathrooms."
"and then we had er washrooms, about four or five washbasins in."
"erm that, that, it, it wasn't too bad because people were coming on duty and going off duty."
"er so i mean they were in use more or less all the time but er it it wasn't, it wasn't too bad, better than a lot of hospitals had."
"er there we did, we had a tutor sister who used to give us all our lectures."
"she did her best to try and to make things more er interesting and she did start a tennis club up, which was nice because there was nothing before then."
and we managed to get er two tennis courts which was very nice and we we all used to play tennis.
and she even managed to get us er somebody who would come and coach us a bit.
"so we, we that, that was er another good thing they, they got going but there was very little for, for nurses to do."
"i think you were there to, and then you see you, you've got to remember that all our lectures were taken in our off duty time."
we didn't have time off for lectures we had to fit them in with our with our off duty.
er and often you'd come off duty at eight o'clock and you'd have to go to a lecture between eight and nine at night.
"and, and you were on night duty you'd be on night duty for twelve hours, you'd come off at eight in the morning and have to go to a lecture at nine."
and it was terribly difficult cos you'd just fall asleep.
"and many, and many a time tutor sister would rap on the desk and say, come on, wake up,we've nearly finished ."
she was very good.
very .
but we used to have to take notes during the lecture and then write the lectures up afterwards.
so you could always borrow  somebody else's notes to write them up .
but nowadays they have a day off for lectures.
er it's much better really.
but we did get terribly tired.
and we had one day off a month.
"and if you were on night duty you'd get two nights off, but when you came back you'd, you'd, you'd have to be on duty that night so you'd have to go to bed that day."
"but we we never complained, no we, we, you know, we, we did, i suppose everybody worked harder in those days."
"i, i mean they did on the farms."
i i suppose  erm  things are easier now.
"and nowadays there's so much er things that er we use, there are so much labour saving things which makes a big difference."
"i think they've all got their own washing machines on the ward and that sort of thing, whereas we had to do it by hand and then bundle it all up and send it down to the laundry."
were there things which the student nurses did complain about ?
"no, we didn't."
we were there because we wanted to be there.
"erm and no, i don't remember."
"we, we might grumble a bit amongst ourselves but we, we'd never dream of, of making a, a sort of an official complaint."
"i  i don't think , we had a matron who was extremely strict and i don't think we would've  dared to say anything to her ."
"she used to sit behind her desk looking very prim and proper, and er i don't, i don't quite honestly think we would've dared  say anything to her ."
what sort of things was she strict about?
er er the way we looked.
"we, we were not allowed to look er pretty on the wards or anything like that."
"we had to keep our hair right under our caps, look very much the nurse."
we were not there to look pretty .
"er and er you, yes she was very very particular."
"we were not allowed to have any ladders in our stockings or anything like that, we had to look very smart."
"er and always always clean and in those, you were, you had to behave yourself when you were not on duty when you were, you, she saw you out not looking er smart she'd soon tell you about it, er, no you let the hospital down when you, you're like that."
"and we were never allowed to go out in uniform, we always had to change er into mufti."
"but er no, she was, she was, she was very particular even on the wards everything had to be just so."
er she used to start coming round the wards about ten o'clock.
and er there were two nurses always detailed to go around about half past nine and tidy all the beds up and the patients had got to look like  patients .
they'd got to sit up and lean against their pillows and their sheets had got to be turned down.
"er very, very neat, very tidy."
"and er all, all magazines and papers had to be put away."
"it was alright when she'd done the round they could, they could er bring them out again then, but not until then."
"and she'd go round and say, good morning, good morning."
"er very prim and proper, and  and er er she'd go all the way round and she'd soon tell you if there was, if the beds weren't tidy."
"or if any, the locker wasn't straight, everything had to be very, very straight, very, very correct."
were the other senior nursing staff like her in their attitudes to primness and correctness or were some of them laxer than that?
they were laxer but a lot of them were very very strict.
"mind you it was their ward and, and you were there to learn and they were there to teach."
and you did the job properly.
"er which it wasn't a bad, a bad ."
"so sometimes the sisters would, would really get it in for a nurse and she'd   and they could make your life very unpleasant indeed ."
but on the whole they weren't too bad.
"they weren't too bad, not on, not on the whole."
"you certainly did learn, you learnt to do things properly."
you see.
did any nurses ever get asked to leave?
"erm, oh yes, yes."
"i mean if you weren't in at when you were in your third and fourth year, it was a four year er training, er in third and fourth years you were allowed to stay out till ten o'clock at night."
but  if you weren't in by ten the doors were locked.
so we used to try and get in  in the nurses' home through a ground floor window.
"and if you were caught letting somebody in through  a ground floor window about eleven o'clock a night , that, that was it."
"you was, were dismissed on the spot, that was it."
that was the ultimate crime was it?
yes.
"oh it, it was, yes."
"and  i don't know i mean it was ridiculous even in those days, ten o'clock was very early."
but er no you weren't allowed out.
and even then er you had to ask for permission to stay out till ten.
"you, you weren't automatically allowed out till ten you had to go to the office and say, please may i stay out till ten."
"i am going to do so and so, or i am going to the pictures or i, i'm going to so and so's for tea."
er and then you were allowed.
"but it er, when you're looking back it, it seems very ridiculous these days."
they really did er  they commanded your entire life.
"you were there for four years and they, they didn't just, if you weren't in by ten and you didn't get your proper night's sleep then you wouldn't be any good on the wards the next morning."
that was their er their way of looking at it.
"er that you, you had to have your sleep otherwise you were, you weren't er you, you couldn't attend to your lectures and, and do your work the next day."
"you had, you had to get your night's sleep and proper rest."
do you think that was an attitude that was erm unique to nursing at the time or do you think erm that possibly girls in other walks of life had the same kind of experience of discipline and demands on them?
"well i suppose probably  people like nursemaids and er and er what they used to call in those days mothers' helps, who used to be a general skivvy around the house and would look after the children, and, and, and they were the same, they had to be in i think at, at sort of ten o'clock at night."
"erm and at that but that, mind you i i suppose that if, if i'd been at home i should have  probably been expected  to be in, but i don't think i should have been locked out."
i should have been allowed in if i was five minutes late .
yes.
were boys treated in the same way do you think?
i suppose they probably were.
"i don't , i mean in those days they had apprenticeships and, and that sort of thing."
you were apprenticed.
"er i, i suppose yes they probably were expected to be in by a definite time."
i don't really think it did us any harm.
"erm it, it was restricting, er but i don't really think the, the, the discipline did us any, any harm you know."
"i, i, it probably gave us a good grounding."
"i've always grown up with the idea if i do a job, i'll, i'll do it properly or else i won't bother, i won't tackle it all."
i think it instilled that into me.
"and if you are nursing you can't afford to make mistakes, it may cost somebody's life if you do."
you've got to have your wits about you.
"if you're giving medicines or, or and that sort of thing, drugs of any sort."
"er if you give an overdose or forget something, not to give medicine or give too much medicine it, it can be very serious, the consequences could be serious."
mm.
yes.
quite.
"and when you finished your training erm that was, how long a training was it in fact?"
four years.
four years.
and then if you'd been off sick you had to make that time up so it was about four years and six months i did there altogether.
mhm.
and then you were a fully qualified nurse?
yes i was a state registered nurse then.
yes and did you stay on at the hospital then?
"er no, i left then."
for the last six months i did erm ward sister duties.
"she, she was off, off sick and er so for the last six months i did sister's duties which was very useful because er it, it, it gave me that little bit of independence, working on my own whereas before you'd always got either the staff nurse or the sister to fall back on."
"you know i was completely on my own i, i'd got to make my own decisions."
"so it really was, it, it was quite nice having that six months."
when you'd got your qualifications was there a big difference between the status of the trained nurse and the student nurses?
"oh yes, yes."
"they er  even in the dining room you, you , there were long tables, well when you came in as, as a student nurse you were right at the bottom of the table, and as you, you know, the second year, third year, fourth year, you gradually moved up and then the, the state registered nurses they all sat together."
"now i think they have little tables now but in those days they were long, just long trestle tables."
"yes you did you, you, you erm you, you were treated differently, yes you were definitely."
"did you get er different privileges as, as you became the fully qualified nurse then?"
"yes,yes, you, you were, you'd passed all your exams so they had to make it easier."
"you, you were allowed to, to stay out but erm you, you had to get permission."
"you weren't allowed just in and out when you wanted to, you had to get permission to stay out late."
they liked to  keep tabs on you even then .
did you stay at  hospital after you'd finished your training?
er about six months.
"just, just a mere six months."
and then what did you do?
then i er decided i'd take my midwifery.
"er so i went to , to the  nursing home, i don't know whether it's still there."
"it's a, it's a training, it was training school for midwives."
and erm i was there for about a year.
"you, you could take, if you got your general your state registered nurse you could take your midwifery in a year."
"and erm that, that, first of all it was lectures and helping, you did get er patients coming in."
there'd be about ooh twenty beds i think.
"and then er after that you, you went on the, on the district."
"er you were called out at night and in those days you went round on a bicycle and  you, you went round with your little black bag strapped on the back."
"and you'd, you'd, you'd be on call and the babies nearly always come at night."
"er and you'd er they'd er just bang on the door and, and call you and you had to be downstairs in five minutes."
er and cycle to where it was.
when you were a student midwife you went with a proper midwife.
"and er when you'd got on you delivered the baby but the midwife was there to see you didn't make any mistakes and, and really to teach you to do it."
it was the practical side of it.
"but erm  yes  sometimes you'd, you'd get there in time but you see they'd just, i, there, there weren't the telephones about in those days so you, you, you couldn't, everybody didn't have a phone, they couldn't ring in and say i'm in labour."
"it'd mean waiting till, often till the, the father came back from work and then he'd have to er sometimes come right the er to the nursing home er to tell you that, that they was, that she was in labour and would we please come."
"er sometimes the police, if, if there was a police station near, they would phone a message through but er quite quite often and then you'd, you'd get there and often you'd  hear the baby was born by the time you got there ."
"but it, it erm it, it was hard work in those days."
"i, i can remember once i, i think it was  hill, or i think it was  estate, it was quite a new estate in those, in those days when i, when i was there."
"erm and there was a hill out, that runs this housing estate , and it runs well through, really through the cemetery."
there's a walled cemetery on one side and well in those days it had railings round the cemetery on the other side.
i expect they all  went in the second world war .
"er but i can remember going cycling up that hill,and the  midwife  was there ,and there was a most awful scream came from this er this cemetery."
it was moonlight too.
and i have never got up that hill so fast in all my life .
"and i, it wasn't until afterwards i realized it was cats caterwauling."
it looked so weird in the moonlight and this scream coming up.
"oh yes, i can remember that."
"you, you did get funny things like that that er that sort of rather lightened things."
"but er nowadays you don't get babies born in the homes like we did in, in, when i, when i was training."
"er and often you'd go into a quite a poor home and you'd, you'd er,there wasn't the money about you see in, in those days."
"nineteen twenty nine, it was in the nineteen thirties when there was the depression people just had not got the money to really provide for the baby as they would do, well they would do now."
"and you'd say, well now have you got a bowl."
i shall want a bowl.
"and they'll say, well yes there's, there's this bowl."
"and you'd say, right, and you'd go the, after the baby was born you, you'd go back again to what we call the nursing, nursing up and you'd want the bowl again for the baby and you'd say where's the bowl and they'd say, oh well i think it's downstairs, we used it yesterday to make a pudding in."
and so you'd have to go and find this bowl and sterilize it again.
"but you, you just had to fit in with things."
"and a lot of the mothers couldn't afford to buy the, the proper erm maternity er sanitary towels that they would have done nowadays."
"er and er you'd say, well try and get on old sheet and wash it thoroughly and iron them the cut it up and iron them with a hot iron."
"and that would more or less sterilize it, as sterilized as you'd, you know, you could ever get anything."
"you see there was no erm grants in those days like they have now, nothing, nothing ."
"so they, they just had to try and save er from the, the man's wages and if, and, and if they weren't in work there was very very little money ."
and people did rally round.
"er the people helped far more i think then than they do now because i suppose now it just isn't, it isn't necessary."
people can manage.
"and in those days most people did have their children at home, didn't they?"
"yes, the majority of them did."
"yes, the majority of them did."
"unless er there was any er you know you, you were expecting any problems."
then they would come in.
but nearly always at home.
"well i suppose they felt it was the cheapest way of, of, of having them."
coming in to hospital.
and er who were the midwives employed by?
er the county council.
"yes, they were appointed by the county council so i and er i, i rather think that they, we never got paid but i rather think they'd have to pay the council something for the midwife's services."
but er i don't remember that side of it .
"i didn't erm i i, i certainly didn't touch you know any, any money ."
and when you were a student erm who was paying for your training?
we had to pay for our own training in those days.
yes.
"the county council er would train you but you'd do your erm year's training and then you had to work for them for a year, i think it was a year or eighteen months."
er and er to pay them back.
and er you were on sort of reduced salary.
"they, they gave you enough to live on."
er but er they got their money back that way.
yes so all this time were you still living in a nurses home?
"yes, yes, yes."
"we were living on the, on the premises."
mhm.
yes.
"can you remember any, any particular births either difficult ones or funny ones?"
"yes, i can remember one ,it er she, she was a stocky little woman too."
"and she came in and she had this, this baby, and it was her thirteenth baby and it weighed fourteen pounds."
"and honestly it wasn't like a baby , a new baby, it was huge."
"and we called it the bull because it didn't cry, it bellowed."
it was louder than all the other babies  all put together .
"and er during the, course in those days you stayed in bed for ten days, you were supposed to at any rate."
"and er all that, her other twelve children all came up to see her while she was there and they were beautifully kept, really well kept and well fed too."
er he was a bus driver.
so she'd managed alright.
"i don't know whether she had any more, she said she hoped it was the last and  i should think she did, thirteen children to look after ."
"but you know medicine was, was very different in those days."
"i, i can remember erm when we ever had women in from the country they'd say, oh yes,my mother told me always to take raspberry, raspberry leaf tea."
"it always gives you a, an easy labour."
now whether there was any truth in it or not i don't know but a lot of country women always used to have raspberry leaf tea during pregnancy.
"er and it always, they always used to say, oh yes you'll have a much easier labour if you do."
whether there was any truth in it or not i've  no idea .
"but there wasn't the, the erm ante natal care that there is these days, i mean there were no erm when you went round to if you were a midwife and you went round to see the prospective mother you'd say, now you are eating proper meals aren't you?"
"well that, that's as much as they ever got."
"you never said you know, are you eating fruit or are you taking vitamins?"
i mean nowadays everybody has vitamin pills whether they need them or not.
they make quite sure they are getting enough vitamins.
but in those days they didn't.
"and er i mean there, there are not the relaxating exercises that they have now."
"i don't know whether they  they, i suppose they really didn't have the time."
see nowadays there's so much more in the way of erm labour saving devices.
in those days the washing was done in a good old copper boiling on a monday and light the fire underneath it and this sort of thing.
"er i don't suppose they had much time for, for relaxing and sitting down."
"they used to say, well i try and get my er my legs up for half an hour in the afternoon, but that'd be about as much as they'd get in the way of rest."
they carried on just the same as usual.
at what point would you first erm see someone who was expecting a baby?
oh about six months as a rule.
"they'd, they'd, they'd say, they'd, they, they were supposed to book a, a midwife you see."
"and, and er then that midwife would call and see them perhaps one well they call at six months just to make sure everything was alright."
and they'd examine the mother.
"and er and then they'd go, they'd, they'd, if the mother was strong healthy and everything was going alright they'd probably leave it another month before they went."
or if they were worried about it then they they'd go sooner.
"but you'd perhaps go three or four times before the baby was born and er just see everything was alright and you'd know which way the baby was lying and which way it was going to er you know come and if you thought there was going to be any problems well you know then you, you would let the doctor know and, and he'd decide then."
"but erm i, i think a midwife, a good midwife, is every bit as good as a doctor because  she's doing it all the time ."
"and she er she, she  a lot of midwives were extremely clever in those days."
and you didn't have the erm all the aids that they have now.
"i mean they put something round the mother's tummy and they can see the heart beating, whereas we, if we wanted to know if the baby was alright and er it wasn't getting distressed you'd just put a, a cloth on the mummy's tum and put your ear down to it and hear it that way."
there were not the aids that there were now.
erm.
would the er patients be seeing the doctor the midwife during this few months before they were going.
no.
to give birth?
no.
not necessarily.
"no, you'd, you'd er you'd just provided you, the midwife thought everything was going as it should, that was it."
"you, you just left it to the midwife."
the doctors didn't come into it much .
"er only if erm the mother was torn or, or if you didn't think the baby was coming as it should, there was problems there, then you, you would."
"you'd, you'd, the, the er the patient would have a her own doctor."
"well and you'd, you'd just send for the doctor."
or if she was torn then the doctor would come er and stitch her up.
"but that was another thing nowadays they, they just don't seem to bother if the mother gets torn, now in those days it was a terrible disgrace to to er if you had a, had a delivery and the mother was torn."
"er it just wasn't done and it was, it was bad midwifery, it was bad nursing to, to get a tear."
er and you know if you sent for a doctor you were almost apologetic that the mother was torn.
but nowadays they just don't seem to bother .
it's just a foregone conclusion.
"no it was erm i was going to say much more natural in, in those days, i suppose in a way it was more natural."
i don't think the babies were any worse or the mothers were any worse.
"you see a working, well they do get them up nowadays, but in you were supposed to stay in bed for a fortnight after the mother was born but you  a lot of these mothers used to hop bed when the midwife had gone, and, and i mean if they'd got two or three children and a husband coming in and they hadn't got a mother or a neighbour or somebody to come in and do the cooking,i mean she'd just get up and get on with it herself."
they'd have to.
"i mean it wasn't done, and nobody knew about it, and said anything about it but it was."
were there any anaesthetics in use during childbirth?
"erm no, they'd usually give an anaesthetic if the mother had to be sewn or if it was a forceps delivery, but that was all."
er it was hardly ever er a mother was just given something to ease the pain.
"er er the principle was that erm the birth of a child is, it is painful but it's not a pain too much for a mother to bear, that was the, the the principle that they went on."
"that it was erm er it, it, it was bearable."
"and not, not many of them really complained."
they were usually glad when it was over.
"but that, no."
"i expect the conditions in some of the houses you went into were, were er pretty poor."
yes.
"they certainly were,it er it, they were very very poor,they, you got into some of the poorer homes."
"er clean, er they were nearly always clean but there was just not er the things there to use."
"that was the trouble, they just couldn't afford to provide them."
and you just had to make do best way you could.
do you think that this er affected the erm chances of the child living?
"er, yes, i suppose, i suppose it, it could have done if you get a sickly baby and, and a sickly mother."
"er the baby probably wouldn't stand such a, a good chance."
"er and you, you'd get er, those days they didn't have cots the mother had the baby in bed with her."
"and i, i can remember a, a mother, she was a very big woman, she rolled onto her baby and, and suffocated the baby."
"now i, i can't imagine any mother doing it twice, but the first time they said it was an accident."
the baby  suffocated.
er er but the second time the police came and asked quite a lot of questions about it.
when she did it the second time.
"but erm, no, it, it i think there were sickly babies."
"but the majority of them managed to, managed to thrive."
did you erm ever experience any babies born with deformities?
"erm no, no, i didn't."
"they were er they were all fairly, fairly healthy babies."
i only had one stillbirth.
"that was, that was the only, only time."
"oh yes, we did, we did have one baby, yes, we did, in the er in the home."
"erm and, and it didn't live very very very long ."
"it was very badly malformed, the back of the head wasn't there ."
erm the back of the skull er and it didn't last i think it lasted two or three weeks but that was all.
but that was the only one.
"and erm i, when i was in, in hospital we did have triplets two of those lived alright though."
"but they were alright, they were just erm er sort but you see in those days babies didn't live."
"now if they said, if a baby was under five pounds it, it wouldn't survive."
er there were none of the incubators and this sort of thing for them like we've got today.
"and er they just , they just didn't, didn't live very very few of them did."
and anything under five pounds well you didn't expect them to live.
but er nowadays they do get a very much better chance.
were the families much bigger then when you were nursing?
"yes, yes."
"i mean four, five, six children, yes."
erm very yes they were very much er much bigger.
"but now er with family planning and contraception er they are you know they're, they're far better really."
"er the, the children are getting a better chance."
they're erm two or three in a family.
"parents today are far more responsible, they're, they say no erm we won't we'll only have the number of children we can give a good start in life to."
where which probably the parents when i was doing midwifery would have said the same thing but there was nothing they could do about it.
there wasn't the pill in those days and there was simply er really nothing that the woman could do to stop herself getting pregnant.
"er it was alright if the man took precautions but if the woman didn't take precautions there was er i mean the man didn't, there was nothing the woman could do about it."
so it was very very hard on the woman because it they just came one after the other.
it was nothing five six you know children or even like that other one thirteen children.
"erm but she, she was quite happy with her thirteen but i think a lot of the others women, no,they er it pulled them down terribly."
"was it any part of your job to give such contraceptive advice as you could to, to."
er.
families?
not really.
"but i mean often women would say, what can i do, i don't want any more babies, what can i do?"
"well all you really could do was say, well you'll have to ask your doctor and get him to have a talk with your husband."
er that was really all the advice we could give.
there was nothing very much we could do about it.
"now i mean the woman can do something which is, it's, it's a very good thing."
"and sterilizing er you know for a man to be sterilized or a woman to be sterilized er you just it, just nobody ever, even considered it."
"it was never not a, never even thought of."
was family planning any part of your training ?
"no, not really, no."
no it wasn't.
erm  were you as a midwife ever approached about abortions?
er no.
"we, we were you know asked, is there anything i can do to get rid of the baby?"
"but er not really seriously because you see in those days it, it was illegal for anything like that."
"that was the, the hard part, there was nothing they could do about it ."
did people find ways of having abortions?
yes.
"there were, there's always been the illegal er abortionist."
"and erm there used to be shops where they would, they'd say, we can give you pills to bring it on, but i, i don't think they ever really did."
"sometimes they'd, they'd try taking a good dose of epsom salts to see if that would start things you know but er there was very little, very little they could do."
"i, i wonder did doctors erm attempt abortions ?"
"erm not, they, they did erm if, if it was you know really a medical, if it was really detrimental to the mother to have another one, er then they would."
"or if they started they'd, they'd always have them in hospital and, and finish it off properly."
erm but not very often no.
"you, if, if, if you, you, you got yourself pregnant that's it."
"erm but it, it, it was very hard, very hard on these families because they worked really hard and the children kept on coming."
"it, it was very difficult."
after the babies were born a part of your job would be to help mothers erm train the babies.
"yeah, yes."
erm.
what was the view of what a well trained baby should be?
well we didn't do a lot of that er except giving advice when we just er going round as a midwife.
but after that i did take up private nursing.
"erm and then you went for a whole month which was, you could do something in that time."
you'd go er before the baby was born and then you'd look after the baby for the for a whole month.
"er and then you, you'd try your best and usually we, we could er get them to sleep the, the whole night through."
"they'd have the ten o'clock feed and then it, it'd sleep through till, till the six o'clock the next morning for the next morning feed."
that's what you'd try to train him to do.
"er but usually you'd have to give  perhaps a drink of erm er water just, just warm water."
er just in the middle of the night.
"you, you had to in those days you had to er use your common sense because if you had a big healthy baby it's a long while to go right through ten o'clock at night till six o'clock the next morning."
"but usually that's what you tried to do, that's what you aimed at doing."
at giving the baby his last feed at ten and putting him down and hoping that he'd stay asleep till well half past five to six the next morning.
"when you left er the mother had had time to, to get up she hadn't had any bad nights."
"er she'd got herself reasonably fit again er and then if she'd take over the the baby you'd, you'd get, you'd train her if she didn't know, if she if it was the first baby."
"er you, she'd take, you, you'd teach her to bath it and, and, and this sort of thing and look after him."
"er and then you'd er say, right now you're on your own now, er and, and if you'd got the baby sleeping right through the night it was so much easier for her."
"she'd just er put him down at ten and, and that, that was that."
in those days there was a great do about babies sleeping in a room on their own.
"well and if it cried well you let it cry, you just let it go on crying until it was so tired it went to sleep."
"erm i, i never did  agree with that very much really."
i don't think i could have stood it crying for hours on end .
"er usually if a baby cries it's usually trying to tell you something er and if, if by the time three or four weeks is up er you, you find out you know if there is anything wrong."
but er usually a baby will be contented if it's being fed properly.
"erm and it's, it's er it's kept dry and it's comfy."
"usually it'll be, it'll sleep from one feed to the next."
could you tell me how you came to move from midwifery into private nursing?
yes.
well it was when i'd finished my midwifery training i certainly stayed on a little while in er in  doing a bit of district work.
s the only one i did do after we were married.
i had my first bab theonly one i did do after we were married.
i had my first baby oo and there were about ooh i should about think twelve nurses in the association.
"and we were either on call or, or we were sent out very quickly."
"all over the place we went really, not just in , all round  and er farther afield if they were short of private nurses."
"and then i, i did quite a lot of children's nursing then, er but also general nursing , a some midwifery and er mainly general nursing."
did you choose to move midwifery in that way or did er or was it just that er a job came up?
no.
"erm i liked, i liked more variety."
"it was a, i think if you really did midwifery er when you were doing it privately there was always a doctor there in charge ."
"er but if not, if you are just doing midwifery i, i think you er really need to stick at it and just do that because it's, it's the more practise and the more babies you bring into the world the better you get at it."
"you know you er get i think  yes i i think you were better at the job the the more practise you got, and the more you did it."
"but i liked er general work, it, it brought all sorts of things in."
different er different kinds of nursing.
er medical and then sometimes people with a lot of money if they needed a not a particularly dangerous operation they'd have it done in their own homes.
"fix a room up as a theatre and bring the, some nursing staff in."
and then you'd stop on afterwards to er nurse them back to health again.
used to get all sorts.
"erm i liked the children's nursing, i was always you know fond of children."
we used to get all sorts of things.
"i could remember one case i had, er he'd be about eight."
"and er they said they wanted a nurse, this child had been very sick and they didn't quite know what was wrong with him."
"but he was very sick so er they wanted somebody to stay with him overnight at any rate so i, he wasn't sleeping, and i, he said what, i said to him, what do you think made you sick?"
"so he said, well you won't tell mummy or daddy will you?"
"i said, no, no, i won't tell them, not unless you say i can."
"he said, well you see i've been smoking."
i smoked one of daddy's cigars.
and that's the reason he was so sick .
"he soon got better again, but i, i never told his parents."
they'd no  idea why they'd been so sick .
was it better paid in private nursing than in midwifery?
erm yes.
but if you erm went to an ordinary general case it was three pounds a week you got er for your er salary.
"but you did get your keep you see you, you more, you usually, usually you lived with the family."
"but if it was a very posh place er you'd probably have your meals with the housekeeper, which we used to enjoy  better really ."
"er and then for midwifery you got four, four guineas a week."
and that we paid half a crown in every guinea to the association because they got the jobs for us.
"so it was the er , miss  's nursing association that we, we belonged to."
"and it was a fairly, fairly high, everybody was fully trained."
"it was erm, i used to enjoy it."
"used to go for sometimes two or three weeks, sometimes if it was a maternity a month, but i used to enjoy it."
"it, you, you used to meet a lot of different kinds of people and er not only that you travelled about quite ."
it was very interesting.
"and you stayed in that kind of work until you got married,?"
that's right yes i did.
yes.
"how, how did you meet your husband?"
"well i, i met him actually through er i was nursing erm a baby, she was only three months old and she'd had, she'd caught, from her older sister she'd caught whooping cough."
er that's why i was there.
"and he was friendly with them, and i met him there."
that's how i first met him .
"so er we were introduced and the first time he took me out er he proposed to me but it, it, it  took me six months to make my mind up ."
but er that's how i met him.
did you get much free time to go out ?
"no, very little."
er very little.
"if, if er if you were on a case er well if you could get out for a, for an hour in the afternoon for a walk, but that was about all."
you were really on call all the time.
"but erm it, it, i don't know, it we we never seemed to think anything about it ."
"we, we perhaps would have a week or ten days cases."
and then we could go out and er as much as we liked then.
"we, all of us had er a bed-sitting room of our own which we kept on between cases cos we had to have somewhere to live and erm and then we, we'd come back there and make  up for lost time really ."
"did you share a, a bed-sit or flat with someone else then?"
"no, no."
"i had, i had one of my own."
"it, it wasn't a very big one."
"it was a put-u-up bed and i think i paid, i think it was a guinea a week for it."
"it wasn't, you know, it wasn't very much  not in  in those days."
"er and then you erm you shared a kitchen, we shared a kitchen."
"there were one, two, three, three bed-sitting rooms and one kitchen between us."
and we used to arrange it when one wasn't cooking the other one would be you know and this sort of thing.
we used to have quite a good time.
"so were the, the people in the other bed-sits also nurses like yourself?"
"yes, they were."
"they were, which was, well it was quite useful really because er you, you know you had to be, you were called out to a case suddenly er there was always somebody just to make sure you hadn't left any food you know in the kitchen that was going to grow whiskers until you got back."
"er yes, it was, we, we were all very friendly together."
we were all actually on the er same association so we were alright.
so then you got married then.
"yes, i did, yes."
and you gave up nursing.
was it immediately you got married?
erm yes.
"i, i only took one case on after i was married er and that er that was a maternity case i'd been to the first baby."
"and they said, would i go er for the second, and i said, yes i would."
but that's the only one i did do after we were married.
"i had my first baby ooh about ooh fourteen, fourteen or fifteen months after we were married, but i lost, i lost my first baby at three months."
but then i had another er one within er two years and i had them both fairly quickly.
"so i had two now, a boy and a girl."
"er and they're both married now so er they're, they're quite off hand."
"but no in those days if you had children er young children at any rate you, you, you never expected to go out to work ."
"that you, you looked after the home and the children."
"they always came first, they were the sort of centre of the family and everything rotated round them."
"whereas now er they, they seem to grow up more quickly."
and even during the second world war er mothers with their children under the age of five er they weren't expected to do any war work .
"it wasn't until they were er six or seven years old that er you'd, you'd took a part time job."
but you were always allowed home when the children were not at school.
"it was far more the usual thing, women didn't go out to work very much, not after they were married."
not even in jobs like midwifery?
erm not unless there was a reason for it.
"you know if there were no children then probably they would, they might do then."
"but er there'd have to be a good reason for it if, if, if erm the nurses did go out, er afterwards."
"sometimes they did when the children were grown up, or hand."
left school.
"er they night go back to it then if they really wanted to, or usually there was a reason for it."
"the husband had either died or something of that sort, or the husband was unable to work, then the mother would have to work to keep things going."
so the reason was always that people really needed the money they just wanted to work?
"yes, i think they did."
yes i think that was the main reason.
"it, it was er, women in those days were quite content to stop at home."
"er and just be a home-maker unless as i said if there was a reason for it, if they needed the money."
or some reason like that.
another would sometimes go back to work er if their son or well mainly the sons went to university and they needed the extra money for that.
"er they probably would go back to, to work then, but it was usual for a married mother to stop at home."
did you ever feel after having your own children that er you would have made a better midwife erm this experience than when you were single?
"er i think i should certainly have made a better nurse, yes, yes i think i should."
er i  when we were midwives we used to say that was the way to bring a child up but when you'd had your own you bent the rules a little bit more .
"er and i, i think i, i should have said if er you know after i'd had my own, enjoy your babies while they're young because they grow up so quickly, whereas before it was a case of, don't pick them up when they, you know, if they cry let them cry."
"they're alright, they, it won't do them any harm."
whereas you know when mine began to cry it was a good excuse to  give them a bit of a cuddle .
"you looked at things differently, yes certainly you did."
mhm.
"do you think that this sort of attitude is probably true today, that the kind of things we learn about child rearing are not the things we put into practise when we actually have children to bring up ourselves?"
"yes, i'm sure it is."
yes.
"i, i think now er having brought my own up and now they've got children of their own and i've got grandchildren er yes my attitude is, is quite different."
i can understand them far better now than i did then.
i can enjoy them far better.
"and i, i think that is a very important thing really."
"because i think that's where grandparent are important to children, specially these days when mothers do go out to work."
"er you, you, you'll find that children will, grandchildren will tell their grandparents thing that they won't tell their own parents."
"now i, i can remember doing that myself when i was young."
"i could tell my grandparents things that i wouldn't tell my, my father or my mother."
but er i could always tell granny and granddad.
and i'm finding now that my grandchildren are just the same.
"their attitude to me, they'll tell me things, because they, they know that you, you, well won't repeat it, you won't tell on them."
unless you think it's really necessary and then you may drop a hint.
"but er yes i, i've certainly find, find that."
"i, i think grandparents have a very important part in a, in a growing child's life."
very important.
in fact my grandchildren feel very deprived because they  they haven't got a grandfather.
they've adopted one.
"somebody  somebody who lives quite near, they're a very nice old couple."
"so they said, well they didn't really want another granny but they, they wanted to adopt a granddad."
"yes, when was it that your husband died in fact?"
"he died eighteen years ago, so he never saw."
he never saw them.
"he never saw them , no."
"so they, they, they do, they do miss him."
what did your husband do when he was alive?
well he was a photographer.
"er he used to do, we used to have a round each morning and collect all the films from the chemists and then we developed and printed them and took them back at night."
"er ooh we had quite a round  er in  and , all the, all the way round the centre of ."
"er and also he had a studio, he specialized, he was very fond of children, he specialized in children's photos."
so we were kept pretty busy.
did you help him in this work?
"yes, i did."
"i used to do all the bookkeeping, before i lost my sight."
i did all the bookkeeping.
and er all the ordering and dealt with the auditors and the bank and that sort of thing.
"i did all that, he hated that sort of thing."
in fact he didn't  understand it .
which left him free to do all the practical work which he really liked.
he also did weddings .
"now he, he liked doing that sort of thing."
"and he was very, he was artistic too."
but that was where the trouble came when i lost my sight he was left with both the practical side and the er bookkeeping which he didn't understand .
yes.
where did you live when you first got married?
did you.
erm.
have a place of your own?
"yes, we did."
"we had a little erm er house up in  grove, just er on the er edge of  park."
"er and then when the second world war started er we, we had to leave there and come down to the er to the shop really."
it was a lock-up shop.
er and we lived above the shop then.
"well we lived there er yes the whole, whole time, all our married life."
"he did move away for a while er and had er workrooms the, from the house and i just ran the, the shop."
but erm when i lost my sight then he had to close that down and come back so we were all under one roof  again .
mm.
where was it that you had to move from  during the war?
"well it, it  i expected that he would have to go and i should have to manage on my own and it was quite er er a, a way to come down to the shop."
we had a shop .
"er and it was much easier to be living on the premises, that's what we felt at the time."
"erm i think perhaps it was a good move in a, in a, in a way, i was, when the children did come along you know i was, we were i was all together under one roof."
"the business was there and, and i was there when he went."
"so it, it was it turned out for the best."
did he go into the army?
"no, he didn't go into the army."
"erm he, i think what he really must have had was er a sort of mild form of polio when he was young and he'd got a shoulder, not completely paralysed but it was partially paralysed."
"so erm they wouldn't take him in the army but he, he was in the more or less he was, he was in the map making department."
"which was well rather up his er his you know his, his own work photography."
it was all tied up together.
he went down to  and trained here and then he came back and  they made all the maps there.
they always knew where the next offensive was because they were making maps for them.
and meanwhile you were still running the business during the war?
that's it yes.
i kept all the connections up.
"we couldn't do because it was er er classed as a luxury business er and so we, we couldn't get an awful lot of photographic paper or films or anything of that sort but we managed to keep the connections up with what we could get."
"er it wasn't too bad, it was there when the war ended."
there was something to start building on again which was a good thing.
so do you mean that your husband was able to continue with this working for ?
yes.
"just , yes."
he he didn't do very much but i'd already learnt the business by then.
er i could er print and do the enlarging and develop the films.
erm so really and truly you know with what we'd got it was carrying the business on in a very sort of low way and going round collecting the work it was all done through the post.
it was all postal work then.
did people want any special kind of photos during the war that they hadn't asked for previously?
yes.
"it was all er er er er yes mainly snapshots we used to get of er new babies, children and this sort of thing."
er you see but the men at the front that's what they wanted.
"snaps to send to the er the fathers and er boyfriends er at, at the front, that's what they really wanted."
er anything special you know that children growing up and you know fathers not seeing them or wives having babies which you know they hadn't seen perhaps till they were two years old.
"so there was a lot of er, in fact we used to try to keep the films for er young couples with, with children."
"it was , so few came through it was very much  under the counter ."
"you, you kept them and you tried to let people have them who you felt deserved them you know most."
it was very difficult .
"but it was very difficult for these for young, young couples with the er er men at the front and perhaps they'd only just got married before the war and it was very hard lines on them."
"i often think er and then you see if, if they er the airmen, their wives used to try and get er digs near where the aerodromes were so they could see their menfolk."
"er and i always used to think it must be extremely, they'd hear them going out at night and you know then count the planes coming back."
"i often think i wish you know we could capture some of those again i think it would jolly well  i, i, i wish government could, could really know what it was like."
i don't think they'd be so anxious to  go to war if they did .
it was the young people that i think were hit the most.
"it was very hard on, on them."
and er.
can you remember any particular incidents that happened during the war?
"erm no, well we were very lucky in , we didn't have an awful lot of air raids, we had it over the lace market and er and near."
"but er we, we didn't have any really bad air attacks ."
"we were very fortunate but i do remember the guns used to go off and i, when my my son was born the, the guns were going off all the time from the castle."
"they, they they had some guns on the castle and they were , i suppose there must have been enemy planes over."
"you could always, you, you always used to say we could tell the german planes coming over er they'd got a certain sound because they were so heavily ladened ."
"and er you, you, you could hear them and used to say, oh yes, that's a german plane."
"but we were very lucky in , we, we didn't really have an awful lot of erm of air raids ."
and as a mother at the time do you remember having problems getting food and things during the war?
"er, yes."
it wasn't easy but it was very fair.
"i suppose in the first world war, i don't remember an awful lot about it, we always seemed to have enough to eat but er i, i think the second world war whatever there was it was fairly distributed."
"we were all rationed but we, we everybody got their fair share."
"and er really when you look at the children who were born during the war and were brought up during the war, they're all pretty strong and healthy."
so they couldn't er have done too badly.
"i mean bananas were, were, only children had bananas and er orange juice, you, you got that at the clinic and cod liver oil, terrible horrible cod liver oil."
"but er they, they did it was fairly distributed there's no, eggs you'd get perhaps one egg a week on each ration book."
"and then they had a points system which meant that er you had so many points and you could, there were certain foods that were just on points and er you could choose to spend your points on whatever you wanted."
"you could get er pineapple jam, that was tins of pineapple jam, that was one of the things."
"and tomato jam, which wasn't too bad really."
but we've  never heard of it since .
"er and not many fresh eggs but we did get dried eggs which were, were, it wasn't a bad substitute but it  wasn't the same as a fresh egg  but you could scramble them and you could use them for cooking but then you see there was very little fat."
erm you could get er er margarine.
"i think we had two ounces of margarine a week on each ration book, and butter i think we had an ounce of butter a week, and meat was very scarce."
come in.
"oh, come in."
"oh, aye."
what can we do for you today mrs ?
erm i feel doctor.
mm.
what've you been doing?
"worth it,."
erm i still feel lousy.
mhm.
but i have a week er  but i couldn't open my week's .
so could you possibly backdate it to monday?
mhm.
because we also work.
aye.
the holiday.
.
mm.
"now, you went off, when, when was it you ?"
"oh, it was a week past this sunday."
a week past sunday .
but you know how you've got a week.
aye.
you can self-certificate .
so that covers you up till the monday.
monday.
does it?
aye.
up till the monday.
right.
the monday.
i phoned in to work and asked ?
yes.
don't come back till you're feeling .
no.
no.
"oh, i've been my weekend off."
yeah.
without this  long weekend due.
". i actually picked up the spots, soon as that doctor came in, to see if they , right up."
"right up my ears,my neck and my neighbour came in, she said, i think that's shingles, cos it was sore?"
mhm.
"but it, oh, it was not shingles."
but i was absolutely  doctor.
it  could well have been shingles.
yes.
it's no proof i hadn't a clue.
yeah.
the stuff you gave .
that beautiful medicine doctor?
mm.
mhm .
it's lousy i hate to tell you.
you think i don't.
know it ?
two bottles of that.
do you think i don't know it?
"you  with her, you  with  cannot pronounce it."
yeah.
and she  i got .
yeah.
is the rash still there?
aye.
"it's  but i mean i actually it was right down in there, right up, right round and it was painful."
"yeah, that's shingles."
it was bloody painful.
if you excuse the french.
that's it.
that's the shingles.
and he wasn't in today  i mean came into work and i passed out in the ..
mhm.
"and when they saw the rash  then they were , but, but tt oh, i see, she says."
what is it?
"i don't know, she says."
yeah.
it could be and then again couldn't be shingles.
but i mean you know how ?
aye.
"i said, god, i was ,."
that's .
i could .
"you can't, you can't pass that on."
can you not?
"i said oh, it's a pity i haven't  then."
oh no.
no.
no.
"it's, you're not gonna pass it anybody, you're quite safe ."
"i was  about that,."
mm.
yeah.
"and they all took, they all."
but that  it takes something like the flu and that brings it out.
do you know what?
"i've, i still feel lousy."
and i.
oh aye.
"finished that medicine i finished it the  my chest, i still feel sick."
quite sick .
go and go home and look after yourself.
don't run away yet.
don't run away yet.
"i'll tell you something, if i  it would be the first cruise liner i could find and i'd be away and i."
oh maybe when you're not.
i  could do this.
"say we won a lot of money first thing i do would be to,with his sisters."
"it's the first thing you got with it, you get a phone call, do me alright."
mm.
don't bother sending a .
i want you to.
look after yourself.
okay thanks doctor.
right?
right.
cheerio now.
need to see where you've got to and.
well  the software came off the tape without any any problems whatsoever.
good.
and i copied it over it all compiled first time.
even the pascal?
even the pascal.
that's interesting cos i mean it is a sort of a  variant.
luckily we have the er compiler for that.
"we have that particular compiler, that was."
yeah.
good then.
yeah.
"i i thought you might in fact but i mean when it was first taken we first looked at the tape, people in there weren't sure so oh that's good news oh that helps a lot because they've tried the original moneytalk was developed on vax v m s."
right.
so that's why you see a lot of talk about vax v m s around  mailboxes and funny things like that which are.
yeah.
which are er well a mailbox is a very crude inter process communication technique used on vaxes.
"but i mean, i don't think you need to worry about that cos i think  got round that when they when they converted ."
should be okay.
yeah all compiled up so what some bits don't work?
erm there there was a problem with the erm lexicon  lexicon.
right.
that just core dumped.
but i was able to transfer it onto a separate system and compile that and produce the lexicon there.
so why did that core dump on on.
i have no idea.
"i  looked through it, couldn't actually see anything obviously wrong with it."
i compiled it onto another system which has far better debugging tools and.
yeah?
it didn't core dump.
but that that that sudden?
well.
hewlett hewlett packard.
oh you did one on the h p.
which one was the one that worked?
the one on the h p.
the h p worked better.
yeah.
right.
but it doesn't it doesn't  so it works on the h p but not on the sun is that right?
yeah.
so i created the lexicon.
right okay.
on the the h p and copied that back.
yeah sure.
and  the first stage which is the formatting stage.
mhm.
works.
right.
"as far as i can tell, the other stages also seem to work,."
right.
but there is a problem with the the second stage which decomposes the.
right.
formatted input.
right.
er into parts of parts of speech.
mhm.
if i tried to give it one one word at a time it falls over and core dumps.
right.
with one word it's unable to determine what what part of speech it is.
this is not unreasonable.
yeah.
yeah.
and  i've been been through er the debugging tools.
pascal on on the main system.
yeah.
and slowly  uphill struggle to actually.
have you managed to locate it at not been able to locate where it actually.
erm.
i've been able to trace back it's probably in a procedure called fetch page.
that seemed to be causing.
well is that fetching i mean is that a is that the routine that's picking information back from the lexicon or something ?
yeah.
right.
i was wondering i mean  there may possibly be differences between i mean there was  the format that speech generate of the h p and the format that the sun would use.
mm.
er now i would think that the lexicon itself is just a a whacking great look up table yes?
yeah.
right.
"er i would check things like, signed and unsigned bytes."
that's the that is the first problem you might find.
have you checked that ?
"so you might find that if you do a thing on the h p you may find that what is being what's happening is that it it it's creating  the wrong size addressings in the look up table because either it's using you know, er signed and it's assuming unsigned byte or something."
"so you've got the data ranges incorrect, that sort of thing ."
right.
er you want to check that specification.
that's quite likely where it's going to be going wrong.
right.
that i i've seen that before between erm vax systems and silicon graphics systems.
"also i mean sun to silicon graphics, sometimes you need to make see what the compiler option is in fact."
"you may find the default compiler option for the h p is different to the default compiler option to handle signed and unsigned integers or signed and unsigned bytes, may be different."
it may well be the case.
er now these are you know is the lexicon a pascal module or a  c module?
it's a c module.
"c right, so i would i i would almost would  think."
right.
it's a sign problem in that it's not doing the look up properly.
these things are hideous to sort out i know.
"erm i mean where they don't work when somebody offers code and they don't work, there's not  you can do make some informed guesses what might be going wrong."
because at the end of the day i mean they're building up a a set of rules.
practically you've got like a rule compiler.
"i mean the the later stages of the system had things like rule compilers and quite complex things  which allowed you a more dynamic interaction with the system so you could actually build rules in and then  some rules then erm allowed you to  shall we say,partition out certain parts of speech."
you found sometimes that other rules weren't required because that rule new rule that you'd finally developed encompassed other classes of events.
you know so so the idea was having a rule compiler system which so you could actively refine it.
"you know the rules got more complex but in but actual processing power, the amount of look up required went down."
one of the reasons for big look up tables is that the  prototype system .
eventually the whole lot would be blown into roms.
in a box.
. well  in fact it was .
and still can buy cards for a p c .
but i'm not sure whether that would be of interest to ian anyway.
that might might.
yes you can actually buy a  card for a p c. and all you do is you feed it erm text and it'll speak it.
yeah.
albeit in an american voice.
is erm ian definitely wants wants new suns.
yes i know.
being targeted at students .
yeah i mean the  would be very nice if you could get it to go cos it is it is quite acceptable speech.
albeit american.
american english.
which is different .
"so you don't get dog, you get dog."
.d a w g. .
er but i think people can live with that  understand sort of americanisms now.
erm that that's i think the main thing you want to look at there.
right.
"er what about the synthesis stage, do you know whether that works or not?"
does it generate waveforms?
it's been well it's it's been been difficult to test because with the sort of the read-me files .
very very minimal so i haven't noticed.
were there any erm already er sort of the intermediate files?
things like er erm synthesizer files.
nothing.
parameter file.
er just wondering whether.
there is apparently book books details of  it's out at the moment.
mm.
i could search round for papers on it.
"there's not there's not a lot on because well i mean,the reason why there's not a huge amount published is because er digital bought the rights to dectalk."
right.
for something like six million dollars.
"and so at that point, nothing very much was published."
no not in the public domain anyway.
i mean there are plenty of internal reports at m i t and at dec but you certainly can't get them .
i have seen a paper  been involved with m i t themselves.
er do you know what the er what a the input file would look like to the synthesizer phase?
it gives a very sketchy idea in the read-me files however it also.
do you know how many control parameters there are ?
is it the twenty one or is it the sixty or forty eight.
without looking through the source file i wouldn't be able to tell.
because erm i do have a variation er a version of the that particular synthesizer  which is a class seventy nine synthesizer.
and i may well have some input files which you could test with.
you need to find out though what version that that is.
it may well be well the one that was out in the public in the public domain.
one that was published in  the journal the american society for acoustical research.
"j a s a, j a s a."
j s?
j a s a. journal of the american acoustical society.
"journal of the american society for acoustics, something like that anyway."
"that that that the original class seventy nine synthesizer was published, the source code ."
and it was originally in fortran source so i don't know whether  is it still in fortran source?
erm no it's pascal now.
is it pascal source now.
"yeah what you need to do is if you can look up the what the input parameters how many input parameters there are, and if there are  if if it's basically a batch of twenty one parameters, er i can probably i've probably got the source code for them."
er i mean the input files.
it depends whether they're ascii input or whether they're binary input format.
i would put money on them being what are called k p r.
yeah.
er k p r format which is  parameter file.
er p r for parameter.
.parameter file and that is actually effectively a a sixteen bit integer encoded file.
and in fact i can probably get you some of those .
right.
okay.
er we moved over to using ascii we could actually hand edit them  and and look at them.
but this is about four or five years ago so i mean it's we've moved on a lot since then.
but certainly we can probably find some stuff for  er to help test.
but did you get er but does the pipeline build ?
i mean there's a program that builds the pipeline.
yeah.
and that all builds?
"right well that's wonderful, i mean that's really good news really,."
mm.
mm.
"you see cos again it was probably in the early days, running on p d p elevens."
right.
right so you've got to think p d p eleven because it's fairly old stuff now.
and i mean unix in those in the early days was p d p eleven based.
and then it moved over to vaxes .
er but i think  could be could be the backspace .
cos it's using er b s d isn't it or  j s d stuff so.
could be could well could have been backspace but still there'd still be eleven stuff around i would have thought.
er you'd probably find that in the  p d p eleven around the place.
.. and if it is then they're probably sixteen bit integer encoded files for the synthesizer phase.
the other thing is that the output frequency is likely to be eight kilohertz or ten kilohertz.
er you need to think about that.
"but again, your hardware you may the output phase hardware, you might need to alter some things in the synthesizer to change it to the from eight to ten to twelve to sixteen bit data."
again i i modified the seventy nine and rewritten the seventy nine  i've had also the the later version of the synthesizer to handle different bit-width so it's not a problem.
and i know how to do that.
there's not a lot about to change.
you know you tend to find there are a couple of fiddle factors around actually .
and magic numbers like multiplying the width of the byte by sixteen point o two five or something .
. you is it really well is it very well commented ?
it's fairly well commented.
"yeah cos i i think you'll find there are various comments like you know, let's say you know, move the the data into the highest er the most significant bits of the word and this sort of stuff."
you know where they and they just multiplying by number doing bit shifts .
"so  so i mean you'll you'll find i mean, it's not that bad."
right i well if you can't get the lexicon going it's got a problem .
. if it was on a p d p eleven then  the addressing would only be a matter of sixteen bit .
in the tables.
so again you might find that that you're generating the wrong type of integer number.
i mean between your two machines.
and also possibly with what it puts as a was it you know have a read of the code.
yeah.
"more of the code, just to find out you know, what size integers it's using."
and i think that's probably where your the problems would be .
mm yes yes.
mm  sure.
that sounds likely.
you know i've seen those sorts of problems before.
trying to think what else there is.
er that's about what there well there's nothing to look at.
"at this stage anyway, then we need to have a another think."
a little bit of detective work i think  to try and find out.
i mean you could even write some fairly simple test programs in fact.
mm.
"that do a little bit of you know, very simple table look up ."
or build a table.
does the does the lexicon generate you the c source code?
like a a c look up table?
or does it generate a file?
it generates a large well.
a large large c structure.
or a just a large table or a large array.
erm  erm it just generates a large large .
you see cos i know that some of the phases you find that  does it you see cos some some of the programs generate programs.
in the in the later versions certainly.
but you you know you  generate some of the c source or assembler source which you then compile.
no i assume that your file is not one of those.
no.
no okay.
yeah i i would basically put money on it being a problem with the the addressing.
and it's gonna be either what a a a short it is or what a .
. yeah i i if there's anything else you want to know i mean i think that's quite a good start.
erm yeah i'll er.
one of those problems anyway.
i'll go through that.
"i i i would think  i can't really see it being much else, i mean it compiles up."
that's what it's most likely to be i think.
okay.
if there's anything else you want to know?
.
i'm generally around so you know.
give me a shout.
don't lose your bit of paper.
okay.
yeah that's fine.
thank you very much.
it's no problem.
"the bad news they haven't arrived so, and that rather, it still."
yes.
"it still ties my hands, hands somewhat."
i mean.
because i received no further communication from anyone so.
"erm i don't know if this would help, because, you know i'm, i, i said that."
ooh a d s s book.
yes that erm you know they wouldn't.
yeah.
"actually give some money, well they've sent this, they've sent this letter so."
still got a d s s book going so.
"no this is the yeah, this is the one that they sent you see?"
when i.
yeah.
"came to you and said, you know they won't send any money because i haven't got a note, but because you was , you know, doctor's."
yeah.
suspicious.
"well you've got a book, so you can still actually er."
"yeah, but you see they sent this on the twenty ninth of june."
yeah.
"but the thing is this doctor's note runs out yesterday,."
mm.
"see, so i can't really cash any more, you know?"
why not?
well because i haven't had a doctor's note and it makes it difficult if i cash it.
but they would have only given you a book for.
right.
"that long, if you had a valid doctor's note for that time, surely?"
"no, no."
"you have to get another one, you see."
it doesn't work like that.
"i mean that's some proof,i mean  i."
"it's proof that someone's issued a book to you, yeah."
"i'm not quite, has, is it gives no indication of why it's been issued, that's the catch."
"well, see these are the ones that i sent in and i didn't think they would, they would agree with because they were duplicates unless they found the original."
mm.
do you follow?
no they won't accept duplicates as a rule.
"well they put those in anyway, so unless they found the original ones,."
"that's, that's two months and that keep  that keeps you covered for a while, doesn't it?"
"but you see the thing is, that's true but sometimes the way they deal with it, they deal with it say eight weeks, so which makes it what?"
about.
"yeah, he's just put yeah he's just put depression."
i mean how do you actually feel at the moment?
"well, i feel better than i was, but i've been at haywoods heath which was a religious community."
hmm.
"and er i feel, i feel i'm generally."
mm.
aye.
what about sleep patterns?
that's fine.
and mood during the day?
"that's fine, not too bad."
see if you're actually better medically.
mm.
you actually become fit for work.
right.
ah  in which case it'd be wrong for me to say that you're not fit for work anyway .
right.
"so er i mean if you, if you, you know, if you do feel you're looking better i mean you look, you know."
right.
fairly okay.
right.
"so i mean if you, if that's how you actually feel then what we should really do is to sign a note at some stage saying you are fit for work on a certain date."
mhm.
and er then what will happen is the benefit you receive will change from.
right.
erm sickness benefit or invalidity benefit depending.
mm.
"how long you've been off for, to unemployment."
"benefit, if you're eligible."
"so i, and, and to be honest i think that's what we ought to do at this stage,."
mhm.
if you remain fairly well.
now obviously.
mm.
if how you are.
mm.
"changes,."
mhm.
you know it's a different ball game.
mm.
and then we have to reassess you and say you're medically.
mm.
unfit and then we sign you off.
but then.
mm.
"also we ought to be treating it, are you not actually having any active treatment at the moment are you?"
no.
no.
"you see  you see i don't mean to be erm rude or anything but as i'm sure you understand you can't really you know, you know write a note without my doctor's notes, because you see i, i think if i get a job at the moment i think it'll just, it won't last."
no.
"well i, i."
i could write a note.
"on my own assessment,."
right yes.
"but i have got nothing to back up, it's like."
before you have the notes?
"oh i can, oh yes i can, i could."
yeah.
write a note treating.
right.
you as my own patient.
right.
"on a, on how i find you at a particular time."
right.
"but what i can't do is to look back and saying you've been, you are like this now but."
"we know from your previous history, that this."
right.
is the course of events.
and perhaps it'd be reasonable to wait longer before we say you're fit for work.
and i haven't got much evidence.
you can't do that until you get the notes can you?
"well it's well i, well i could do but it's tricky i mean to some."
right.
extent i'd be happy to keep you going for longer.
right.
there's no .
"what i don't really want to do is to sign you off sick long term, without really knowing i mean."
mhm.
"what's been happening before, what's been said."
yeah.
"to you, what's been given."
yeah.
to you.
yeah.
exactly what sort of thing you've been in.
and you can say some of.
"yeah that's, that's  what i."
"to me but i i still, i don't get the same feeling from you as perhaps i might with medical notes, if you see what i mean?"
"well i, i, no i agree."
yeah.
with you precisely.
yeah.
"i think that you can't really make a decision until you have that literature, you can't."
it's tricky.
"but what i'm, what i'm, is because you've got this order book."
yeah.
"and these, you know things from the benefits er agency, because if i cash any more it makes it so i mean."
yeah.
"what, you see i don't know when these notes are going to come up."
yeah.
you see?
well what i.
and i need this cash .
yeah.
i mean what i suggest we.
do.
yeah.
"given you're, given how you are at the moment, which."
right.
"is probably not one hundred percent medically fit,."
yeah.
is to actually give you another note for the moment for say.
right.
erm where are we now?
"we're july, so if i say another six weeks, that'll actually get."
right.
us through to the first week of september.
"right, so these."
and then.
you can.
and then have another chat.
and if you are fairly okay then we'll probably say well we'll sign you off at this stage anyway.
but.
mm.
"we'll have the notes to back up what we're doing, and i."
right.
think that'd be sensible.
it'll.
right.
keep you ticking over for the moment.
which is what you need.
"yeah, yeah."
"and it'll erm, and i think that'll be reasonable."
yeah.
is that okay?
"that seems okay for now, yeah but."
it's a sort of compromise.
when you.
"decision but it is difficult to know which way to go, when you're actually up you know, i, i wouldn't say you're a hundred percent but i wouldn't say."
right.
there's anything too much wrong with you either.
right.
"now what i've got to put a diagnosis on this, so if i write depression cos that has been the problem hasn't it?"
"right, yes."
"yeah, is that fair enough?"
yeah.
"and if i put six weeks, now this'll overlap slightly with the present one, that doesn't matter the d s s don't give two hoots from that point of view, and that'll then run out six weeks, which is about the beginning of september."
right.
exactly.
"but i, you know, i agree with this, thanks for the, writing the note, but."
that's okay.
"erm   especially that when you get those er notes from haywoods heath,."
yeah.
and then see what you think.
but i mean i don't want to stay on the sickness but it is.
yeah.
invalidity.
it's sickness benefit on your.
mm.
income support.
so it's.
mm.
exactly the same amount of money.
"yeah, oh yeah."
"so you won't gain any extra, yeah."
"not unemployment benefit,ordinary income support."
mhm.
"but, you know, when you get those notes if you could look at them and see what you think."
mm.
yeah i think they'll be informative.
mm.
"oh yes, yes ."
yeah.
"it's a question of getting them back, they haven't long gone but er."
right.
"they will return, complete i hope."
okay .
right.
"is that there's no point in, in er me going to work if it's going to just, you know, work out."
no.
"so i'm just, you know, unemployed again."
yeah.
"but as i say, when you get those notes, if you really, you know, try and understand them so  you know."
and if i can read the other doctor's handwriting.
yes.
"anyhow we'll sort that out in september, i'm sure they'll be there."
we sent in an urgent request three.
yes.
weeks ago for those and i'd be very surprised if they don't  soon.
apparently they should be on their way because nottingham was er.
they should be.
yeah.
they should be.
"alright, thanks very much ."
"right okay, take care of yourself."
hello.
yes sir.
well what hat can i do for you tonight?
er i feel plagued my mouth ulcers for about three weeks now.
three weeks?
aye.
that's a .
nonstop.
when one goes away i get another.
another one comes.
i've got about five just now.
let me look at them.
look inside.
i've got them in my .
aye.
your gums are all inflamed .
aye.
put your tongue back out for a wee look.
that side of your mouth's all infected .
"that's a, that's a form of thrush."
see i've been coming for years with mouth ulcers.
you know.
mhm.
but don't get me wrong after a while i just gave up and i was getting them in bouts and i was getting through the bonjela and the.
oh no.
no.
they're not.
i'd done a round but and really this time it's not going away you know?
mhm.
and i don't know.
tt.
there's a special place in glasgow where you go to see the specialist who looks after folk.
mm.
with mouth ulcers like yourself.
where they keep coming back like that.
aye.
"if, if."
if you could maybe refer me i would be happy with that.
mhm.
sure.
i will do that.
i'll get that organized.
"i thought i'd a had a, i thought i'd had a problem but i, i injured myself ."
and er that's why i didn't cancel appointment with you.
yeah.
you know?
right.
"i've got a medical coming up, a work's medical coming up in er."
mhm.
"for a job and i'm just, that would be another."
reason i had to get it.
wanted to get it sorted out.
er you're robert that's right?
mm.
you're robert.
sorry i've forgotten your address robert.
right.
right.
now what other injury have you done yourself?
i was carrying wall units  and i'd taken fourteen wall units one after another up two flights of stairs.
"and i think i had about, i don't what i've done really but i just, the following day i felt it in my, my groin, the left side of my groin down my leg and up my stomach."
"and i went to my mate this morning who's a boxer and he said that it's now maybe, maybe a groin strain."
mm.
or a  hernia.
or something.
let's have a wee look at you.
no.
but i've.
.
"sounds you've a strain, the way you're walking you know the."
aye.
"i'm not right sure i, i've been what it was you know?"
because i just went to work the following day and i worked away as normal.
that's right.
so maybe i'm maybe about fourteen stone i'm  at .
. any.
where does it start robert?
"well it's actually on my left, my left testicle and underneath."
mm.
"down my leg and, and up you know."
and.
aye.
and about here?
aye.
yes.
you have a strained  just through there.
that big muscle.
this big muscle here  ?
mm.
and at the same bit the muscle  up here.
aye.
and it joins with.
"yeah, that's it working."
that's just lovely.
mhm.
i'll i'll stick it under there.
that's just lovely.
now is this just is this to to mind me.
aha.
i was gonna ask you.
and the first one would be where .
that would be sanday was it?
"aha, he was  sanday."
mhm.
at that time the erm there wasn't he wasn't  undertaker.
he was a joiner and on the islands the joiners had to do undertaking.
mhm.
and any well not anyone but most of the joiners did the undertaking more or less in the area they were in.
"so would like the three different sort of areas of sanday, the parishes, each have a joiner?"
cross.
well there was one well father was in cross but er there was one in what we called the south end.
aha.
and he was getting to be an old man and he had actually stopped and then father would take er would be asked to do the undertaking in that part.
mhm.
and er there was another man a mr peace who had been.
mhm.
an undertaker and he lived near the centre of the island.
mhm.
near the village in.
mhm mhm .
and he did but then he was older and he eventually stopped and er there would have been one at woodhouse in burness.
but eventually.
mhm.
it it came to be that it was the older men usually that were asked to do it i mean the people i suppose maybe felt it was more suitable to have older folk coming in to their houses.
mhm.
mhm.
and er and then he was the only one who did it.
i see so the older chaps would just gradually.
well he i think probably the first he must have been a joiner for a wee while before he was  you were just asked to do this the same i suppose as any other job any other joiner job.
mhm.
mhm.
on the island.
"mhm, that was just part of the job then."
it was really part of the job.
mhm.
mhm.
so did he.
do you think he served time on the island with one of the older ones ?
he served he served his time on the island.
he was actually the oldest son of a farmer and er was expected to stay at home and  the firm.
mhm.
but he went and got himself an apprenticeship and then his parents saw that he.
mhm.
was really serious about being a joiner so he went and he served his time with a mr  at woodhouse.
mhm.
"and they did a lot of things just the old way you know, where they had the."
mm.
"the pit and the the circular  with a saw you know, the wood, they had to go down in a in a pit."
i don't really understand it but the the apprentice went down in the pit and the  older man was above and they worked this saw  all this sawdust was coming.
oh i see.
yes something like that you know.
was it a handsaw?
it was a hand saw that they did this ripping of the wood with.
good grief.
but that was but again he served his apprenticeship as a joiner.
mhm.
not as an undertaker.
he'd have been undertaking with this man.
i see.
but it was all part of the job.
a chap on sanday  was in sanday.
aha this was a man who had been a joiner there for a long time.
mhm mhm.
and was his son going to be a joiner ?
"he didn't have a son this man, no he didn't ."
he didn't have a son.
so he's be able to afford.
aha.
to take.
oh well he he he had to take on a oh he could easily afford it because he was paid about five shillings in the year.
and he got the he i think he said his first years pay was five shillings.
mhm.
and they got a harvest.
so they were allowed to go they were allowed to go and work a harvest at a farm.
mhm.
to make money.
but then father didn't  do that because he was staying at home and he was expected to do his harvest on the farm so his money was five shillings.
and that was that.
. yes that's right.
that was it.
and his keep at home.
he didn't have to.
aha yes.
yes i've heard of that in south ronaldsay.
it was a chap that was a smithy and they got to choose when they were in their in  either the harvest or one season at the fishing.
oh it'll be the same idea aha.
yes.
aha.
mhm.
and then how long would a apprenticeship take then?
aye well i think it was three years.
and then they had to be a  for a certain length of time before they would be a master joiner.
mhm.
mhm.
so he would did he.
i'm not certain about that.
aha.
did he have to did he look on that as a profession to do beside the farming or did he.
oh he just wasn't interested in farming.
right.
mhm.
so did  have to take  them.
and he was yes aha aha piece work on the farm.
aha.
aha.
i see right i get you.
"and then he would serve when when when the other was the mr  he trained under, was he one of the two older joiners on the island?"
he would have been one of the older joiners.
mhm.
there might have been three of i don't know how many there were but he was one of the older joiners.
mhm.
so would you be brought up on sanday ?
yes i was brought up on sanday.
aha in cross?
in cross.
in cross.
and yes and how long would did he serve his whole er time on the island?
worked all his time on the island ?
he worked he worked all his time on the island the time he was in the army.
he was in the territorials so he was called up.
mhm.
the friday before the war started and was there until.
mhm.
he was demobbed.
mhm.
"he while he was away, there'd be just the older folk on the island."
i suppose so.
mhm.
and he came back after and carried on?
aha.
and he came back and carried on.
mhm.
"so the er the other joiners on the island, they acted as undertakers we discussed that."
it was just seen as a normal part of the job then really .
it was indeed aha.
you just did what had to be done.
and it.
yeah.
it had to be done.
ad what happened then when somebody died did you hear.
well mm.
oh there's somebody that lived in the house in.
aha.
and you would he used to go to the house and.
mhm.
and er had to measure up the body because the coffins were made to measure.
oh i see.
he had to go and they would i think  actually sometimes had to lay out the body .
really?
aha.
aha.
i because we didn't have any part of this being children i mean we just knew that he.
no  mhm.
somebody had died and.
mhm.
he used to go to the house and he'd measure up the body and i.
mhm.
think they laid it out and.
mhm.
then er they'd come back up.
mhm.
so he would maybe get word from the head of the house or the nearest call on them .
yes the the the person most yes would call on him and.
aha.
oh would this be formal would the other person be dressed in sort of black clothes or aha .
"i would imagine they would have worn their black cap anyhow, that would be the respectful thing to do."
yeah.
aha.
so you would know when you saw what colour that it would be that.
"well yes, aha."
yes.
they were they were calling for.
and how much time did it take to make the coffin?
well i was just talking that over with er his apprentice and he said.
mhm.
it took them  a long time to begin with when he started.
oh really?
aha.
it took them i can't remember how many hours but it took them a long time.
but then by the time they were he retired and they were finishing they were they were taking about less than half the time.
because they had staplers and before all the.
oh i see.
tacked everything was tacked.
aha.
and it took longer.
aha.
so just the new the sort of technology coming in.
aye it would probably help a bit.
"and the two of them working together over a long time, they would work."
aye.
together more quickly.
mhm.
so when he heard did he just start immediately then?
oh yes.
everything.
aha.
the whole household just.
really.
mhm.
the whole household was needed because  the well he had a store of big boards.
mhm.
mhm.
for the sides had to be shaped.
mhm.
well these had to be bent you see and they they saw a wee bit through them.
mhm.
mhm.
but they also had to bend then.
yes to make them.
and they used hot water.
they had er boiling water.
mhm.
mhm.
and the only way of boiling the water at that time was on the  stove in the house.
so everything that would hold water was put on the stove and er he did  and then it they took it out to the.
mhm.
workshop and they would cover this board with woodcuttings like what we call spills.
mhm.
mhm.
and they poured the water and that held the heat in and then bent to the shape.
for the sides.
oh i see.
aha.
the the bottom  would be cut to the size and shape.
mhm.
and then the sides were moulded with the hot water to fit.
moulded mhm.
so you didn't need to cut the sides .
it was enough just the hot water and the spills.
they i think they made small slits in it.
i can't remember because we weren't in the.
no.
really paying much attention to that.
mm.
so that would involve your mother .
oh yes.
she would.
aha and also they had you see they had glue a glue pot.
they had the glue had the glue they did a lot of gluing i suppose fixing on the material.
oh i see  so mhm.
and er the glue pot was also in the one this  stove.
it was a metal container.
aha.
with water boiling in it and a wee pot that fitted in the top.
oh i see.
"and it was great big, lumps of glue."
looked like huge gigantic pieces of toffee that he used to put in here and it melted and.
and was it dark.
it was dark brown.
gooey stuff.
mhm.
i can imagine a baby would just delighted.
yeah.
aha.
yes aha.
poking a brush in it and whirling it whirling it round.
so would he call in extra help to make the coffin ?
no.
just himself.
just him just him himself and his apprentice.
and er would you usually was there a special time of anything that he would be told.
was it usually a.
"oh no they would come right away you see, because the body would have to be laid out when it was er."
oh .
mhm.
when it was .
he went right away.
be practically the first person to know then wouldn't he?
mhm .
first.
aha.
yes i would imagine so after the doctor.
so in the beginning do you think you were speaking about a whole afternoon and an evening to make the coffin or all day?
oh much longer.
much longer.
between because before they got  he went away and measured up the body and he also had sometime then you see he would have to go and  put the body in the coffin.
and before the funeral the they would he would probably have to take a window the house.
oh.
because the coffin had to come the  stayed in the house the the.
aha.
corpse.
and.
yeah.
aha.
"i mean you like the ordinary houses are, there's no room and you could not bend the coffin with a person in it so they would have to take the window or the bedroom or wherever the corpse was."
mhm.
they took it out and temporarily fixed it in they could get this out at the funeral and then he had to go back later and fix the window in.
good grief.
well that was in a certain houses.
yeah.
and.
if they didn't.
"just to to to put the coffin into the house, the wouldn't have to take a window out to put the coffin in."
i wouldn't oh no they would get in alright.
i would imagine yes.
well in most cases i would think so.
yeah.
mhm.
so erm did you have any ?
oh yes we used to get the job of sewing up the wee cushions.
mhm.
inside the coffin that went under the head and the arms and the feet.
and it was made of a sort of very i would think cheap starched er cotton.
be white?
yes white and and.
aha.
very decorative.
there was sort of  decorations that went in.
oh.
they were they was not just plain yes it was bonny.
so was was.
and er we they used to fill there they were just filled with woodcuttings.
mhm mhm.
and they would be sent in and we would sometimes sew up the the cushions.
oh good heavens.
and stuff them.
mhm.
so was the material already with this decoration on it or was.
oh yes.
aha.
aha.
that didn't have to be sewn on by hand then.
mhm.
everything was.
mhm and was it sewn on decoration or was it printed?
the  decoration.
i would imagine the cushions maybe were more plain.
mhm.
but they had sort of decoration that was tacked on or  on the inside of the coffin.
oh i see.
so was the inside of the coffin lined with cloth.
it was lined.
mhm.
and then covers and trimmings round the edge.
ah.
so would it.
and the outside then was covered with black.
ah.
a sort of well it looked like black wool but i mean it obviously was a brushed cotton i would say .
mhm.
mhm.
mhm.
and er that then would be decorated round the edges with a sort of heavy lid kind of braid.
mhm.
it had gold markings on it.
mhm.
mhm.
yeah.
and then they had the handles and the tassels and then the top there was a tin sort of plate.
mhm.
with a name on.
and that also had to be done by hand.
"father used to do that, he would sit in the evening then and he had to scratch on this it was a like a tin plate with a black sort of area to scratch."
mm.
out the erm  the name and age and whatever details  wanted on this.
and then it was painted with gold paint.
i see.
"and would this metal plate and the strip of metal that went round the top, would that be like ready made."
yes aha.
yes  came from some.
aha.
ready made.
and another thing that sometimes had to be done was writing out off er the they didn't put er notices in shop windows or anything.
they always bid for funerals and i can remember folk on in  being horrified at the idea that folk would put a notice in a window.
"in writing, telling folk about the funeral."
mhm.
they always had bidding for the funeral and sometimes the family would write out the the bids.
"oh i see,."
and it was all it they were they were special forms for it.
ah.
mhm.
and you would the name had to be filled in and the time and the details.
mhm.
and then the wee letter went in a envelope.
mhm mhm.
and it would be relatives that would do the bidding in a certain district.
mhm.
where the person was known.
i mean if they were known widely through the island they might have bids going further but it might just be your own district.
mhm.
but sometimes that had to be written out at the house.
mhm.
and sometimes it's just the person or the family would come and they would want i think they used to by these from the shop.
i see.
the for the bids.
mhm so did they they give them the folk.
they went around and oh well they they couldn't post them because there was no post at the time.
"and  post on a wednesday, friday and saturday."
mhm mhm.
so they they didn't post them they people did the bidding they just went round like a postman and.
mm.
handed them.
and handed them handed them to the people.
handed them to the.
aha.
mhm.
and they would have a.
they were all dressed in the navy blue suits and their white and their black caps .
mhm.
yeah.
and would women ever be bidders?
no women didn't go to funerals.
aha.
in sanday.
mhm.
cos i've asked a few folk.
aha.
"you know, and they've all said women had no part in that er ."
women apparently attended funerals in .
but i can't find out why?
women attended funerals in  i did they not do it in evay?
"i don't know, i don't know about that either."
i don't know either.
but er  i can remember being in evay and a funeral there and to me it was very strange because they carried the coffin from the kirk right down to the kirkyard at the pier.
mhm.
"well you see in sanday, they didn't do that."
they took it first of all it would be in a cart drawn by a horse.
a horse drawn cart.
mhm.
mhm.
and then in er in a vehicle.
it could even be a very often a school bus.
och really.
you don't think.
long enough.
mhm.
and the sprinkle what they call the sprinkler was a smaller car.
mhm.
"and with the back door off you see, they would get that on that."
mhm mhm.
but they're quite long distances in sanday you see.
yeah that's right.
while on evay it was shorter distances.
mhm.
"and the funerals were i would say, nearly always from the house."
yes.
not from a church.
not from the church.
mhm.
so the women of the house would be involved.
yes.
mhm.
but er they just didn't go to funerals.
to me.
it was very strange.
mhm.
"i remember one funeral when i was a little girl at the school, was an old man who died, benji  he was i think he must have been the best the last  in orkney."
and he died at  we call it in sanday and it was snow.
mhm.
so they couldn't get along the roads and i think the the probably the funeral was put off they could put it off.
and then they carried the remains across the fields to the lady kirkyard and that was past the school and i can remember us watching this procession going across the fields.
"but that was the only and then in sanday in the what we call the north end,."
mhm.
"of the island,."
mhm.
they had the hearse.
the the old hearse that er.
yes  there was a picture  and that .
mhm.
mhm.
mhm.
so you wouldn't you would just er mind er the kind of less fancy it wouldn't be particularly made like the one in the north end it was  cart and a horse .
no it was just a it was just a cart and a horse.
yeah.
mhm.
"and who would drive it you know, was it a special person that drove it?"
no it would just be the person that owned the.
whoever owned it.
who owned it.
mhm.
would lead the horse i would imagine.
mhm.
erm  i meant to ask you about the inside of the the coffin was that plain white material or was it did it have this u pattern on it .
or did just the pillows have the.
i would think it would just be trimmings.
but i i'm not right sure about that i don't remember .
mhm.
"but the er the inside was they had wax , the put on it."
oh really.
on the wood.
at one stage aha.
mhm.
what kind of wood would they be made from do you know?
"well i would imagine it would be a very rough sort of wood, i don't know ."
aha cos it would be covered.
they were never left uncovered  i see .
oh no no.
they were always covered.
mhm.
and a children's a child's coffin would be white.
ah yes mhm .
and i don't.
mhm.
remember seeing one of these.
just.
mhm.
was there.
white coffin.
any status attached to the kind of wood you had.
oh no no status .
"oh yes well you see, very occasionally, i'd heard of somebody having an oak cokin coffin."
mhm.
mhm.
but there was no oak coffins in sanday.
i see.
"except i mean, if anybody thought they were    oak cokin coffin that would have to come from somewhere else."
oh i see.
that wouldn't be made then .
enough to have a oak coffin that would have come from somewhere else  everybody got the same.
in sanday.
yes.
occasionally someone who'd died another type of undertaking was where somebody had died the island.
yeah mm.
and that again all the arrangements would be made.
mhm.
but you didn't have the coffin making.
the arrangements would be made and er oh well i never saw an oak coffin but we you'd hear.
mhm.
that and it probably wasn't oak it was probably just.
yes.
stained wood but er.
yeah.
it would look.
aha.
they wouldn't be covered then.
no.
if they were.
i think that would have been very  but nowadays the.
yeah.
the black one would be more.
yeah.
"so what happened if somebody die off the island, did they have to send them."
an undertaker on the mainland and then the remains would come on this boat.
in a coffin already ?
in a coffin already.
and the.
aha.
funeral company would meet the boat.
really?
and er they would proceed from there to the.
i see.
to the kirkyard.
so would it be what was the boat serving sanday then.
wouldn't be.
it would have been the old .
right.
when i remember.
mhm.
i see.
so would there be any special arrangement then?
somebody to get the coffin off the boat or would it just be .
i don't well i imagine it would just come off with any other cargo.
yeah.
mhm.
and then be straight onto the.
probably.
probably.
"it would probably come off first i would imagine, i don't know ."
mhm.
i don't really know because i was never at the pier when when a.
mhm.
i'd gone out on the boat.
but er.
mm.
but all the bidding and the would be arranged.
mhm.
before they came up.
mhm.
and there would be a funeral when the boat came and i mean when the boat came is just when the boat came.
i mean it might come.
yes.
the boat didn't come at any scheduled time.
you knew when it was supposed to leave kirkwall and it went past this island or that one but.
mhm.
and it came roughly at time.
mhm.
"and what about moving the if it was a a sort of burial on the island, how was the coffin moved to the deceased's house?"
was that moved in the cart or was it just carried across to the deceased's house ?
oh well it couldn't have been carried because it was long i don't know how cos i can't remember.
but i guess they just got some way .
just.
father would have arranged that likely.
aha.
would was it er.
i imagine that he would take it when he had a vehicle later on he would.
yeah.
probably take it in the back of that.
yeah.
but early on you see he when i before the war he'd nothing  was first of all a push bike.
mhm.
and he went to his work on and then a motorbike.
mhm.
and sidecar but.
mm.
maybe the folk there'd be some arrangement made to get there but what it was i can't remember.
do you know if there was a special time that they did this at?
or did they choose a kind of evening do you know?or did it not matter?
it would be a pre-arranged time.
the folk were.
aha.
there was no sort of accepted time.
i don't think no accepted time i don't think so.
no.
no.
no it wasn't a particular occasion or anything ?
no no.
oh no i don't think so.
mhm mhm.
and.
i think if they .
yeah i've heard of that mm mm .
but that would be when the aha.
so it probably would be arranged.
aha.
so do you think that the  would happen the coffin got to the house ?
i would imagine i would i would imagine so.
oh i see.
that's another.
i didn't think  but i would imagine so.
and then you see the family would be there.
mhm.
so the coffin would really arrive and then you.
aha.
would have the dressing.
i would think so.
mhm.
but that i think they were.
no no women would really see that .
aha aha.
oh well the women of the family would.
yeah.
everyone in the house.
so the women would be at the.
yes aha.
yes.
they just wouldn't be at the sort of burial side  graveyard.
aha.
and er the coffin's left open and folk would go and.
mhm.
well  people would to the house to offer their.
mhm.
condolences and they would people were always asked if they wanted to see the remains.
mhm.
or do you just want to remember him as they used to.
yeah yeah.
aha.
but .
mhm yeah.
that's true.
mhm mm.
and would the undertaker also be responsible for the  to lift the body into the coffin.
no that that would be they'd be expected every person would have i imagine they would well everybody had a white sheet just for this .
mhm.
yeah.
yeah.
somebody dies.
it was part of the equipment of the household.
yeah.
the the some of them made their own shrouds.
i would imagine so.
yeah.
the shrouds  to be the suppliers you know.
aha.
but i imagine some person would want to use their own.
mhm.
shrouds.
mhm.
but mostly i would think it would be.
mhm.
and would the would your father be at the funeral or would he.
oh yes.
yeah.
he would.
he would he would be organizing the taking of the salt and the he would stay until the.
mhm.
until the grave was filled in.
mhm.
so did he take part in that ?
he'd fill the grave in.
yes.
i i remember once a cousin came it was a trip day.
mhm.
and this a a cousin came out for to sanday.
mhm.
and he asked at the pier for my father.
mhm.
because he was he we didn't know he was coming.
"so they says, oh that's this was pointed out to him."
"so he said, oh  i yes but he says, just come him, so he went to the funeral and then he."
yes.
first things first.
so he always remembers the time he went to this he's no idea who's funeral he was at but he just went along and then he was taken to see the family.
that's quite good.
"and another occasion father said, erm  he said the kirkyards weren't very well laid out."
mhm?
"i mean  they'd gravestones here, gravestones there and."
mhm.
"sometimes when the grave digger dug the grave, they would find er that it was somebody else's grave and they had o start again."
i've heard of that.
aha.
"and er on this particular funeral er the grave, the whole company was there."
mhm.
"and this man came me father and he says, that is not the right grave, you've been told."
the family had you see the family had to come and tell him where the grave was.
mhm.
and then he would arrange for the grave digger to dig the grave.
i see.
mhm.
only they'd been told the wrong grave.
on no.
"so father says, well just keep quiet about it until the funeral's over."
mhm.
"and then when they're all away, we'll get  the  moved."
so the funeral went on and the person was lowered into the grave that had been dug and the grave digger was asked to stay behind and they quickly got it put where it should be.
for heaven's sakes.
aha.
the person who told him was actually i suppose the person who's  family owned the grave that.
yeah.
it was.
that's quite amazing there wasn't even more mistakes like that made.
"well there might have been that nobody knew about, i don't know."
yeah.
but that was one case that he said and then he said it was getting quite dark by that time when the boat came in it was quite dark.
so they were it was quite dark before they got the.
mhm.
oh i see so this was a burial off off the  the boat .
the boat the the body off the boat.
aha.
aha.
good grief.
so there wasn't any overall plan of a graveyard  arranged.
well very poor plans.
aha.
i think for  but then families moved and.
yeah.
mhm.
i think  better now but i think there's probably it's still quite still difficult quite difficult in the old er.
mhm.
kirkyards where they're not really marked out.
mm and i don't think there was any real proper records kept of who was where.
no i don't think so.
cos nobody was responsible for that really..
no no.
but i i think it would be i don't think that could happen in the newer kirkyards.
no.
but it was just the fact i suppose that maybe some of the the family had died out and the person that was wasn't just quite clear where it was.
aha.
so would coffin making stop on the island when your father stopped?
no.
no?
there was a man a mr  down in the north end  leslie  who used to be the apprentice he took.
mhm.
he started up on his own when father stopped.
mhm.
when he retired and this er mr  did the undertaking.
mhm mhm.
i don't know if he was a joiner  he was a joiner certainly.
mhm.
but i don't know if he was a time served joiner or if he was just a he was really a very good handyman.
mhm.
and was a joiner.
mhm mhm.
but whether he really was a time served one or not i don't know but he did it then.
mhm.
.
and now you see undertaking's still done on the island.
oh really?
but the coffins are they come from the mainland.
mhm.
they probably have a supply of them.
mhm.
you don't know when coffin making stopped on sanday then?
roughly what date  that would be.
i don't know.
mhm.
i know that father he used to  you see if he was going the island.
mhm.
and he was away april  he would always have a half-made coffin a sort of standard sized one.
mhm.
in a  underneath his workshop.
the apprentice.
oh right.
"they could he could carry on and do it, just as a sort of emergency thing."
i see was this.
that was in the very end.
mhm.
but before that time i guess father didn't leave the island.
that's right yes.
so there was no problem.
mhm.
aha.
emergency.
yeah.
i see so there would be if he was this would be at the end when you know  this wasn't he didn't ever do anything like that before he went off to the during the war?
he didn't.
no i think it was just straightforward.
yeah.
but then towards the end of this would this be to help leslie ?
just anything happened ?
i don't know.
because i was home by this time.
but i i do know that er.
mhm mhm.
he would have.
so it was probably about the nineteen what early seventies coffin making would stop on sanday .
i don't really know but leslie could well be able to tell you.
yeah mhm.
did you did you know what your father ever thought of the modern coffins?
oh i suppose he yes he was a very modern minded person.
aha.
i guess he thought it was fine.
aha aha.
i don't think it'd been very lucrative work with the amount of time he took to it.
no.
no not if they would what spend about a whole day making it would they?
oh well there was a lot of more time than that taken up you see.
aha.
because there's all the other running .
yes it was a whole.
aha.
it wasn't just coffin making.
he probably would get a sort of wages it but er  running i would imagine would be for nothing.
yeah.
mhm.
you'd probably would it maybe be a set amount for making a coffin.
i would think so as i would have think so.
aha.
aha.
and i don't think it would be very lucrative.
mhm.
but.
"well as i say, i was born in the pleck."
you were born in the pleck yes?
street.
mm.
i had three brothers.
any sisters?
"no sisters until mother got married again, and me  sister as i call her now, she's me my half sister, jessie, she was born  i'd be about seventeen  cos she didn't get married till after the first world war, remarried  me step-father was in the forces and  he fought, he actually fought in the boer war so he was a  a soldier in the boer war and in what we call the great war, nineteen fourteen to nineteen eighteen, but er  i had a misfortune to lose the brother me, frank, which he had what was common in those days tubercular trouble,tuberculosis affected the bowels, see he died in, on august the fourth nineteen eighteen in the old infirmary that now classed as the manor hospital, but that was the old infirmary  cos there was no widow's pension in those days, our mother was a bridle stitcher and she used to do  have an clamp, have you ever seen the clamps that are leather,they held them, the leather, she used to stitch bridles at home, we used to help her with waxing the threads have a leather apron and a bit of wax and pull the wax over the thread, and then roll it round till it was strong enough to thread it, we used to make the threads for her to er stitch the bridles."
"who did she do this for, who did she work for?"
"well i believe, i'm not certain on that, it was in  street i think it was   and er she also worked for joseph  in  street too, when she when she went, went out to work she was working for joseph  stitching for him too, but he became later mayor of walsall and i believe he was liberal mp for it  pat  the liberal mp wasn't it?"
you said your father died when he was quite young?
"well he was  as far as i can remember he was thirty eight  he, he went  he worked at the gas works, can't remember much about that really but er i think he'd actually been working nights and came home and actually died in bed i believe."
and what was the cause of his death?
"well it, it must have been heart trouble the earliest memory i have of that is mother sending me with a neighbour street, a mrs , to tell my aunt lucy which was my dad's sister, who lived in  street house,house was right opposite their gateway, now aunt lucy and there was er her family she married a fella in  and her daughter, her son and me uncle  was my dad's brother, i lived in the house with her, but er i remember tagging this mrs  from the  street down to  street along  road and past the hospital, then along  walk and i up in  street, and er tagging mrs  and er mrs  had never met aunt lucy and er me aunt lucy suffered, what in those days they call it white leg,a woman's complaint she was bedridden and er when we went in she must have asked why we were there, mrs  was flabbergasted and i blurted it out oh me dad's dead, and me aunt lucy nearly went into hysterics, so that's, that's all i can manage i remember about that."
did you go to his funeral?
"we didn't go to the funeral, but me cousin dora who was aunt lucy's daughter, she got  there was er walter,, walter and leonard were in a pram and me cousin dora went down  lane and to the corner of  street and watched the funeral go past i've got vague memories of that they're not clear but i do know that he took us to watch me dad's funeral past the corner of   street and i presume that it must have gone up  street street  street, cos he's buried at ryecroft."
"and what do you remember of it, what did you actually see?"
"well i i was only seven years old, so really i only, i only saw the, the hearse go by with the mourners."
what did that look like?
"i can't, can't really remember that, not too clear cos when you are a child you don't memorize these things."
would it have been a horse-drawn hearse?
"oh it was a horse-drawn, horse-drawn, there were no cars on the road in those days, i think i was one of the earliest to get knocked down by a car actually in walsall, i was er, when we lived in  street he came down  street and immediately opposite there was a co-op shop  opposite birds the fruitiers, and mother sent me down to the co-op and the old trams used to run along the pleck to darlaston, wednesbury and that way on and i ran across the road, past the co-op the tram and a car must have just bumped into me and he knocked me down, a terrible commotion amongst the folks and couldn't have hurt them much, because i got up and ran off, ran off home, so  they were restricted in you see and the  speed they could go in the car, but the car, the tram car was stopped at the bottom of  street, almost opposite the co-op and er  i must have just run across the road  run into the car and more or less bounced off it i should think."
what did your mother say?
i can't remember that  mother was a  cos dad was still alive then.
how old were you when you moved into  street in palfry?
er about nine years old.
"do you remember the actual move itself, when you moved the furniture and all that ?"
"no i don't remember that, because we, we'd be, we'd moved from  street into  street and er  i went to  road school first and er  er my mother's mother, that's my grandmother, she was living with us then  she used to live in  street."
what sort of house was it in  street?
"er  two bedrooms, it was a number sixty six  street in those days, there were new houses built on where it is now, i haven't been into palfry for years but er there were five houses in the row, there was a family named  at one end, there was us my nan we were , us was mrs, a mr and mrs , and then er  that was one side of the entry the other side of the entry was a family named , they had quite a large family, there was er two or three of those married mrs  and then er then mrs  they were all relatives , cos there was no such thing as overcrowding in those days you got as many in as you could you see , there was, another was mr and mrs  she was a daughter of mrs  there was mrs and mrs  she was another daughter of mrs , and then er  there were, there was a, a young man  he was a son of mrs , the  were i think show people originally cos they were anyhow there were five houses down the yard we hadn't got running water in the sink, we had a, a big stone pump pipe in at the bottom of the entry we all had to go and draw out our own drinking water from this one standpipe."
for all those five houses?
for five houses yes and.
what about the toilet arrangements?
"the toilet was er  at the back of what we used to call the brew house it wasn't a kitchen it was a brew house, and er the, the toilet was at the back of the brew house the old ash pit, which was an ash pit in those days it was filled up and when it was filled, they used to come at night  and empty the ash pit wheel up the entry it might be there for three or four months and you got flies, bluebottles all sorts in the hot weather you know, i couldn't try my shoes on sometimes , but er it was , well i suppose in those days they used to take it for granted, it was primitive it wasn't the best five houses in the area, but er."
"was there any water into the toilet, or do you ?"
"no you have to get a bucket of water and flush it with a bucket, what we did have on the sink in the brew house was a  a, a  about a couple of foot square and on the top of that was an old pump handle, well that water used to drain all the rainwater from the roof all rainwater from the roof used to drain into that well that was sunk in the brewers, we could pump water the little well, we could have soft water for doing the washing, rainwater, otherwise it meant going to the standpipe in the, out in the yard to get your water for washing."
"what happened in the winter, did it ever freeze up?"
"well the standpipe used to freeze up and er when that occurred the grown men in the house used to light a fire round the standpipes, it was cast iron it wasn't copper or anything like that, and light a fire to thaw it out, i don't remember ever being without water but we used, it was primitive but  burn newspaper and stuff round the standpipe and er the old as i say we used to, the water for the washing we used to pump into the sink and er  fill the old dolly tub with water for the washing and use the rainwater for washing."
"what sort of furniture did your mother have, can you remember how it was set out?"
"well the, the bed, there were no spring beds in, that came into my life until many years after, were the old straw palliasses, which were really more hygienic to sleep on than your spring beds, because you get the lumbar trouble with a straw palliasses cos it was just hip firm, i give you an instance i used to, as i was growing older i used to fold my trousers and put them under the mattress to press my trousers so i'd always got a nice crease in my trousers, they were so solid that er you got you didn't even get any wrinkles in your trousers in those days."
what other furniture did you have in your bedroom?
"well there was an odd chair or so, but that nothing really."
where did you hang your clothes?
hook on the back of the door or  there was no such thing as wardrobes.
did you have a bedroom to yourself or did you have to share it?
"no there was er  three lads in the double bed and er another two lads in the single bed in one room, and mother was in the front room she had husband in those days you see when we were growing up, there was a  it was not unusual to sleep top-to- tail if we had any pals, if we had a party and we had any pals we'd sleep top-to-tail one with a head at the bottom and others with their head at the top, sounds like something the dickens when you start talking about it don't it?"
"but i have actually slept top-to-tail when we've had parties and it's too late for the lads to go home, now just get into the bed top-to-tail and keep warm the winter and yeah."
what about the rooms downstairs what were?
"well there was always the parlour, you must have the parlour and er you, you had two living rooms and the one was the parlour and there was a cellar underneath the parlour and er  the stairs used to come in from the back and go up, up the stairs over the entrance to the cellar but the stairs used to run up there underneath the stairs was the entrance to the cellar, there was a door, you couldn't just walk down the cellar without opening the door you see, but that there was er there was just the two, two bedrooms."
how often did you use the parlour?
"well very rarely it was  i, actually i'd say i wasn't really furnished what they used to call the sofa down the one side and there was chairs around there was no three piece suite or anything like that, but er if it was a wet sunday afternoon we'd  play draughts or games like that, as we grew older we used to play, play whist, so it was just a room for oh and we had a gramophone, i, i've actually got the old gramophone case i haven't got the working part i've got the case upstairs now, it was a, i, we er, i bought it and the pals used to club around and buy a record each week there was er parlaphone, they used to have a little shop on the corner of  street and  street, and we had it from there, and we used to buy , a small record perhaps once a week, perhaps once a month, but er i remember the first record we'd, we'd bought as a long play was no no nanette and er a twelve inch record."
"and when was this approximately, when would that have been?"
the early twenties.
you said you had a part-time job with the local baker can you tell me about that?
"oh as i the part-time job we used to get, two shillings a week and he used to give us tuppence for ourselves the two shillings was for our parents, and the tuppence was supposed to be our pocket money, but er  when we'd finished on a saturday night if, if there were any stale cakes we'd all get a bag of stale cakes each  you used to make a terrific fuss of those on a sunday."
what exactly did you used to do?
"well  one of you on cleaning fruit, getting all the stalks and stones the fruit, we used to have a sieve, not a riddle, a sieve with round, the wires were round in the sieve and you rub it, and the stalks would drop through and then you'd put them out onto an iron baking sheet and sort out all the stones that and little bits that were in the fruit and you'd be on cleaning fruit you might be one day, the other whichever one was the  you'd be cleaning and greasing baking tins, ready for the baker to put the cakes in or what have you, and then  at night we used to grease all the bread tins ready for men to be allowed to drop the dough into the bread tins, and er  stuff like that and cleaning up scrubbing down and."
"how many hours did you actually work, was it each day?"
"each day we used to do  say an hour in the morning, whatever time was available between leaving school and getting back, dinner time, then in the evening you might have two, two and a half hours  you left you, you finished school, and er you might finish at eight o'clock if you were lucky you'd finish at half past seven."
"and was this seven days a week, or did you have sundays?"
"oh yeah you had sunday off, there was a  the boss mr  was a congregationalist, he used to attend  road congregational church."
you said you used to deliver some of the loaves to mr  's other shops?
yes.
tell me about that what you used to take them in.
in a basket scram it's three wheel i've had as many as a hundred and forty pound loaves in a scram to push from to  street road.
you had a shop in  street .
"yes, there were always round about three lads and er if there was snow on the ground, two of us would be pushing them you know."
was it just a small wheeled.
small wheeled.
and it was wicker did you say?
"wicker, wickerwork basket the one had got a top on and er the big one which i had a hundred and forty loaves, i didn't have a top on but you had a waterproof sheet that you put over the top of that, but er the small ones had a lid on was hinged, hinged lid you could fold it backwards, as far as you could empty it and er what they used to do coming down  road you used to give it a good push and then jump on the back and freewheel down  past what is now  lane er  is that convenience still on , in those days the  was a gents toilet, a public convenience where you went down steps, you were actually the urinals there was toilets there."
no i believe that's gone now.
"it must be i was only thinking the other day the number of bakers  but er the number of small bakers that were in caldmore there was the two  brothers one was in  road and one was in  street there was  on the corner of  street, where the co-op have that place now that was  they were all bread bakers, were bread bakers er  further down  street going towards   street was  bakery, they were a bakers and confectioners   in  street."
how many were there in palfry?
was there just mr  or were there.
there was mr  and then further up  on the right hand side was a fella who used to have the contract for  making the bread for the.
this is in  street?
"in  street a man named  he had two sons and he had, he had to quote, give a contract for it, but he always used to do what they'd call a workhouse feed, and it was a four pound loaf, when my father died mother didn't get a widow's pension, what, what she got was two shillings for each lad, there's four of us, that's eight shillings and a four pound loaf for each lad."
"how often did she get that, was that once a week?"
"that was once a week the bread, we used to have to collect the bread from  road, there was a small office at the side of the infirmary i believe it was mr  or something like that, but we used to have to go to this office in  road and collect this four pound loaf every wednesday and you didn't get another issue you had it , so we had four four pound loaves, so we didn't know what new bread was after the first day, i've never ate so much bread pudding in my life as i did then  with a and er."
"tell me what you remember about the palfry working men's club, your sort of earliest memories of it."
"well, it was actually started by a few railway men,right opposite  street there used to be hand laundry, and then there was a row of houses, from there, running the corner of  street where the club stands originally, but in the beginning it was just a row of small houses, and it started with a few railway men having a holding the meetings in this house, in these houses, and i've got very dim memories of how it actually started but it was a real event when they were first, before they actually built the club it was run in the row of houses that ran from up  street as i say there was a little hand laundry corner of  street heading onto  street on the left hand side was  the greengrocers, and that, they kept that greengrocers for as long as i can remember."
so you say it was a few railway men that got together and.
"that, that was the start, the start of it, i think how it actually commenced so they used to get in 's houses and play a few games of cards dominoes and draughts things like that, and they, they took over they must have actually bought the houses before they built the club."
was there a shop or a beer shop or anything like that in these houses?
"not in those houses but there was a, an off-licence at the corner of  street, do you know where  street is?"
"well that was kept by fella called  and they could get the beer off-licence, although it wasn't, it wasn't so far to the old naked inn and then there was a pub on the corner of , i can't remember the name of that because they've opened it too young to remember pubs in them days but er, the off-licence there was no actual public inn on  street, there was off-licence, as i say just a few yards down was the old naked inn and there was a pub on the top of   just on the side of ."
do you remember the rebuilding of the club when they made it look how it looked now?
"well  i was at school when they was rebuilding, they were, we didn't have much time and."
but you can remember all the activity and the.
"i, i can remember all the activity and er when it was erected there was a fella from the first world war , he lost a leg in the war and he was the billiards room and the tables, when they built the club  itself the front part used to be devoted to card games   and then they installed a billiards  hall and the tables and as i say a chap named  he used to live in  street, but he was, a lost a leg during the war and they found him the job of looking after the tables and marking."
so when would this be then roughly can you have a stab at it?
in the early thirties i should think.
when they built the billiard room and that extension?
"well i was er  it would be about nineteen twenty two, i was about, cos i, i was er used trip the light fantastic fantastic you know when i ran about seventeen and we used to  which billiard hall there was an entrance from  street and it went up the steps into the dance hall, it was over the top of the billiard hall right to the private houses them, it was quite a  i was sixteen, seventeen in that er dance hall at the time."
"how often did they used to have the dance, when you were young?"
oh on mondays and saturdays two or three times a week and it was er available for anyone that want to hold a dance they could rent it   there was no jitterbugging  it was just the waltz or foxtrot and two step  and then we got er   one they used to kick their legs about.
what the charleston?
charleston.
people have mentioned that madame  used to have a dancing session there do you remember this?
"she used to rent it for dances, but her dance class was in er  do you know where the territorial hall is in er  street?"
"her dance hall, her dance class was down there, london parkses dance class but she, she used to hold her dances in the club hall, because you could get more in."
what else used to go on in there in the way of activities  you mentioned billiards and card games and dancing?
"what did go on oh it was available for wedding parties, birthday parties, anything like that, it was the only hall in the area in those days."
i've been told there was some baths in there as well.
"well , that's the thing we did appreciate, because er in those days no, no house had got its own bath it was a case of a tin bath on the hearth, but when i joined the club when i was working in the , when i was thirteen i, i left school cos me being  having no father i was able to leave school when i made me attendances, oh that's something that might interest you i was thinking about."
i see from this school report you've shown me it said there were fifty seven in your class.
"well that's, that's, that is it  you've got the original there haven't you, that there are photostat copies but something the one that is the original copy that's the original it isn't a copy."
yes that's right.
were there always this many in the class?
"that was a, that was the number in the class fifty seven."
do you remember any of the teachers particularly well any of them that had had an impact on you?
"well there was er  the one who had the most important influence in my school life was albert edward , do you remember  the printers, he was a teacher and he used to teach standard four, that was your last standard in the junior, and he had a big influence on, on me because er he wanted me to  go into the printing trade as an apprentice, but i, me leaving school at thirteen and going into full-time work i couldn't do, do that but oh there was er ,, he was an officer during the war  he was in the and there was  oh our, our school teacher, we used to call, we used to call him  his name was actually arthur i think, but he was always, he was addicted to the little whisky bottle, he used to keep a little bottle in his desk and he'd be having a nip of whisky, but he was what was approximated as a sports master now, he used to look after the football team, we used to call him, i suppose his name was arthur but his name was ."
"the first teacher i had in the infants was a miss , she had a bad habit of rapping you across the knuckles with a ruler, and there was a pupil teacher miss , funny thing about that is she, she, she came , mr  came up as headmaster and miss  came as a teacher, she was a pupil teacher it wasn't necessary to go to college and get degrees in the, she, she used to be a pupil teacher in the infant school when i was at school, and miss  was actually at the sunshine school when my daughter was going to school."
did you mention that there were one or two pawnshops in the caldmore in the palfry area can you remember them?
"well there used to be one on  the corner of  street and  street that was , that was a pawnshop right opposite the churches facing it  the church were on the one corner  street and  used to be on the opposite corner, and johnny  was a member of the church choir as i was after i was ten years ten years old, i  mr  he must have thought i could sing he sent me down to st paul's and i, i went to st paul's church on the corner of  street and i didn't stay there long because it was  i was still working part- time i was still a schoolboy but er  i did sing in the choir at st paul's church for a time, and then i went, i went back to st mary's and all saints in palfry as a choirboy and er we used to have choir practice once or twice a week, i know we had it wednesday night, the choir master was albert edward  he was a butcher, kept a butcher's shop on the corner of  and."
who was the vicar in those days?
"the actual vicar was er  it was high, a high church, father  and then there was er  he was a vicar and he used to live in the vicarage which is higher up than the church at the back of the church  street, and there was father , he used to run the boy scouts troop, and there were, i believe there were, there was two curates, i, i think the other one was named , but in those days either in  street i think it was in  street there was er  two or three sisters of mercy that used to live down there, and they used to, cos being high church they were able to go, they didn't do any preaching or anything like that but they did parish work around the parish you know, they used to, they used to call them sisters of mercy."
"what exactly had they used to do in the parish, was it when people were sick ?"
"well they, they, they'd do visiting like and as you say when they were sick and things like that."
can you remember what you used to wear when you were a choirboy?
"cassock and surplice, a black cassock and white surplice once  i told you that my grandmother was once living with us, she used to delight in washing my surplice and ironing it up  except me when i was singing in the choir, i didn't take a, the treble solos, that was after the choir used to sister of ours oh twenty men, and as many lads and youths the  as i say johnny  was in the choir there was er the two  brothers and there was dick  was a  incense boy and his father was a manager to go in the, he used to have a red cassock and surplice, but he used to  dick  's dad was the incense swinger and they used to go about swinging incense and that, i don't suppose they do that now, but er your first job as a choirboy was to pump the organ it, have you ever been in the church?"
no i haven't.
oh i don't know whether it still exists but er.
it's still there.
i mean the organ.
oh i see.
"the organ there was a you know where you put your pump belt, there was a long  stout piece of wood and you had to keep pumping that up and down to put the wind into the organ, and there was a mirror above the organ and mr  the the organist, who was a butcher in  street, he could look into that mirror and see whether you was pumping fast enough and he could signal to you and he used to warn you to er keep your eye on the mirror and if he, if he wanted more wind he used to be up up up oh or , but it was just a big long  of wood and we used to pull it up and down, i was fairly tall for me height age, but er we used to have to stand on a box to get it going first, but it, it was just like  bellows for your fire you know, wind for that, and we used to pump the wind into the organ also the service."
"you used to sing the weddings and that type of thing, or was it just the normal sunday service ?"
"it was only sunday services but er we did occasionally have, cos you don't get a wedding every day, but we did sing occasionally at the weddings, the biggest service was at easter when there was quite a performance at easter  yes johnny  he was a  he was in the choir and he's, there was another woman that might be interested a mrs  in  street during the fourteen war they used to have the red cross collection and they'd organize processions round  round the streets collecting for the red cross and they used to knit socks and send them out  and all that sort of thing."
"where did young people used to gather and when, meet when you were a young lad?"
"on the, on the, on the corner of the street under the lamppost, we'd, a family named  used to live on the corner of  street and  street i lived in that house, but they used to just congregate on the, on the street corners."
this was when you were a young lad?
"when a young lad, well as a young lad you weren't allowed to be cos you're not going to be in there son, and as i was er saying until i, until i left school i was more or less at work between school and bedtime you see, but er the majority of lads used to do a, do part-time job in those days."
"what were the people like in the street, the neighbours, were they erm?"
very friendly.
yes.
"you needn't lock your door up in those days you could leave your door open, and they'd come and knock on your door and anybody in and i, i don't think we ever had a key to our front door, but er no they were very friendly and there used to be an old midwife, mrs  her name was the, she used to charge half a crown for a birth."
where did she live?
i don't know or  is it  street or  street?
i think.
"well it was that area, our mother  used to go fetch her she she came into our yard two or three times  but i know."
"did she come when you had your sisters, or was that someone else?"
"i can't remember that  but i know she, she'd been to the families either side, mrs  she'd got one son and two daughters and there  and what have you, and then at the end house furthest from the lock was a family named  they got two lads and oh she only used to charge half a crown."
was some families rougher than others?
definitely.
in what way?
"well, you learned to hold your own in those days, but some, some of them weren't too particular about bathing and what washing you know things like that, but er you got the usual crop of pigeon flies but there was no hooliganism, occasionally when, when it was election time and when sir richard  was candidate for one year i remember, they came round and the people from  street and round that road they paraded through caldmore and palfry and there was a little bit of rough stuff went on there heckling and booing and shouting, but i don't think any harm done."
were there any different class of people that lived in that part of town then  street and  street and that?
"well  street was really i should say the only industrial part of caldmore or palfry, cos there was harveys had a factory up there and there was a little bit of factory work in  street, there was actually a small factory on the corner of  street and  lane, but the factory area was mostly in ."
was the mac's pickle factory there when you lived in palfry?
"my step brother, tommy , do you know the original  well mr  was a sales rep for bokes couriers, and er his wife used to make pickles, homemade, and she mr  used to give his friends a jar of pickles occasionally and er from that  the idea of selling them, cos it after they'd started distributing amongst his friends he got the idea that there was a market for it, so  my step-brother tommy  er  started to work with  mrs  we used to call them mrs  but her name was , street you know where  street is, well on the left hand side of  street about oh at the back of the first row of houses in  street, there was a, a small open space and mr  had a big shed put there, and er started buying the pickling onions and er  all the women who wished to started skinning onions at so much a bag for mr  and er  he'd gradually built himself up but me step- brother tommy  was er working full time helping mrs  to pick the  onions  and, and that, that's how mac's pickles started was just from a mere fact of him being a commercial traveller and he'd distribute them to his friends and created the, a market for himself really  actually they, they, they did have a van driver and a van, a van to deliver them as they gradually increased the supply and they used to deliver them all, all around the area."
when would it have been approximately when he started this would you say?
i couldn't tell you exactly.
was it after the first world war?
oh it was after the first world war because everything was rationed and you couldn't buy onions but er  i'd say it was about seventy years ago.
that?
cos i'm eighty three now so.
"do you remember the caldmore and palfry shopping festival it was in nineteen twenty three apparently, do you remember anything about that, anything about competitions and odd things like that?"
"no  being what i thought i was a man in those days i wasn't really interested in them, but i know there was competitions and er  i believe there was different numbers posted on windows and if you got the right number you got a prize but  i remember palfry park i'm having trouble with my eyes i've got over-active tear ducts and."
"have you, oh dear."
i haven't got cataracts but  they keep watering i remember we used to go in.
can you tell me of your first involvement with the support group?
"well back in september  a few weeks after the quarry men first came out on strike  a few of us went the picket line, a few of the women."
"we were quite aware that the er quarry men  well then there were fifty three out on strike er fifty men and three women, very much wanted to er well play it their way in a sense."
they didn't er they they weren't used to industrial action i think it's fair to say  and er they didn't want they weren't quite sure whether you know they they might be taken over by well certain political factions if you like.
so i think you know we were all very aware of that of people that were had been active in the miner's strike.
i was secretary of the miner's support group that was set up in blaenau during the year long miner's strike where we collected a lot of food and twinned with a town down in south wales and made a lot of new friends.
"and we used to er do a food run down and they used to come up and erm  and then we went along to a to a lodge meeting the men invited us along  and i remember one of the comments back in september from one of the men was, oh well i'm gonna be nagged back to work soon."
"and er  i think we thought from that well why not set up a women's support group and er see what the reaction was really from from the women you know and i and we said in that lodge meeting will you ask everybody all the women that you know that er are involved, the friends the girlfriends and wives, to come along the next tuesday and we'd have a meeting of our own."
and that's how it started and it was really just you know we said we'd do a bit of fund raising and i think the men were pretty  sceptical  of you know they they thought we might fight over the first tin of beans or  whatever .
and erm  i think they've been i think they've changed really over the months i think all of us have and erm  well that's how it started anyway.
when you first er when you first went up onto the picket lines erm how many of you were there then?
ah this was really just yona and and me you know i mean  yona obviously felt very strongly about her father standing in the rain on the picket line worked hard all his life an it had come to this really being sacked er they were just newly sacked then.
and we just went up you know just the two of us  asks is there anything we can do you know was as simple as that really and it just er grew from that.
i mean suddenly we had the example of a women's support group from the miner's strike  that we had the idea you know from that erm and yona really put it in a nutshell when she said i think er er you know behind closed doors the women worrying about what was gonna happen next you know they felt very frustrated and in a way it was a way to channel our energies away it was seen as that really in the beginning you know as a a sort of a more as a way of getting rid of the  well you know the sort of desperation er the impotence one felt of not being able to do anything in this situation and it's er  and we've all become as a group very close er you know we're we're more like a big family now really an sort of er a lot of the women have never really regularly been to meetings an the commitment there is very strong really that we all turn our tuesday meetings .
it's like  i don't know how  you know i don't think any of us miss you know tuesday evenings.
how do yona yesterday referred to the atmosphere of the of the  of er the women's group.
mm.
or the quarry men support group.
mm.
erm it's been something which is which was quite unique really erm in her experience of of groups of people.
yes i suppose it's true that for somebody like me i've been involved in quite a lot of different groups over over the years  and the quarry men's support group is  it's difficult to put in words really er  exactly how it's erm  you know i think it's very easy for groups to become sort of set really and er well i've always wanted it to to involve everybody and  i think it does that in a way it er it's quite special to all of us in in a funny sort of way it's er you know we feel quite committed.
and it's to do with everybody's lives you know it and i think it is er people are realizing that they can.
you know our first victory was within forty eight hours of being set up.
the quix supermarket had refused the box because they'd although they'd had it for a for quite a long time during the miner's strike i think.
all the bad press that miners got and in a sense quix was responding from higher up probably by saying you know well take the they took the box away in fact at the end of the miner's strike and then when this strike came along they thought it wouldn't you know the the they that was their rule sort of thing.
"and i remember one of the women saying, oh well we'll pick at quix we'll make a real fuss."
"and erm our local er press was there and i think he went away and phoned up to quix and said, oh well you know they were twenty five to thirty women in blaenau i never you know sort of their not your usual erm politicals  if you like  you know they just."
and they they seemed very determined er you know if if you don't i think you'd better er put the the box there and within  twenty four forty eight hours  or whatever it was we had the box in quix you know.
and i think we were all slightly surprised that we could have this sort of effect.
"and things like writing leaflets in a way you know that comes up in meetings we'd better write a leaflet and the response usually's, oh gosh we can't do things like that you know, we can't speak , we can't write leaflets and in fact we do you know we find ourselves achieving these things and and i mean i think men really  their attitude has really changed over the months."
"i don't  i i think there's probably a lot lot less sexism just i think we've won their respect by you know and and certainly when they didn't want us to picket in the beginning, and then over the months really the women have done quite a lot of successful picketing when we've been asked and and we've staged quite big pickets quite a lot of you know the big pickets were really organized and the rallies have been organized by us and really quite a lot of the input into  into the strike i think has come from the women's support group in in quite a unique way."
i think that's true what yona says you know it it is  cos you know i the sort of the political people of the town tend to be councillors who are er men mainly and set in their ways and think that because they've got the label councillor behind you know front of their name that they're they are for life you know it's and they're respectable inverted commas members of the community and you know and  i mean i hope that all this  i mean it's  it's a shame it has to happen in such a desperate situation you know because i mean none of us can really feel glad that  because to be on strike is i mean each day is is hard i'm sure for well i mean i can only say because to be close to people on strike it's quite a unique thing really for me and you become so involved and close to people and you realize how hard it is for them.
"but i think this we'll all look back you know and things, i mean it's a bit of a cliche,but er  it's not gonna be the same again i don't think it is gonna be the same again in blaenau i think people  have changed."
you said or you implied that the women were surprised that er that they could have power and you use it effectively.
erm how did that sort of perspective come about the sort of things could be theirs do you think?
well it's difficult to pinpoint it in words isn't it.
it's like it's it was a you know it's been and still is an experience you know it's none of us almost you know we we don't realize it's happening and you know you like back on the minutes of.
we've tried to keep our our support group also you know to go back as loose as possible that we haven't great great format of a chair and a secretary and a treasurer although we do have that frame work because we've discovered we also needed some sort of structure.
and if you look back at the minutes and then yona i think she's great as the secretary because she doesn't let anything go but on the other hand she's pretty informal about  and the way that over the weeks  you know somebody er julie or june or mervia ann  come up with the suggestion that they maybe feel  why don't we do this and then by the next week it's turned into a a rally or a big picket or or a record.
i mean they're they're all gonna do this this record next week erm the quarry men are going to do their own record with .
"you know and it's a sort of awareness you know then and and now we talk about, oh we've got to stay together after the strike i mean what what are we going to do ."
and every weekend really there's a social organized and i mean i think although packing the food parcels  on a saturday  is in a sense well you know if we take the food thing nobody knew really.
"i mean we had an example from the miner's strike but that was happening far away in a sense and it was just something that you could support or you didn't support or you put a tin of beans in the box in quix and that was what you did you know and then actually faced with having to accept food from that people had given you in a way, it's a very quite a difficult concept."
i don't think anybody knows exactly how they'd react to that you know and i think the women's support group has created the frame work that's enabled us.
"because it was the women themselves who were organizing it because they felt part of it they didn't see it as some sort of other people that were more politically motivated that than them giving them something to keep them out on strike, which by its very nature could could have been something that  the people would have accepted for a while and then not accepted."
but it grew slowly over the weeks and i think christmas was an example of just the actual logistics of what we did at christmas must be something of a feat in that so much stuff came in from the volume of presents and then the way in which they could be distributed.
i mean if you think about it  it was just an impossible task to do it fairly or everybody felt about it and also that you know if it's your own children you're having to choose presents you know the whole idea was very very difficult really.
and i think it was an example of the trust that we'd built up over the weeks and months that we were able to do it.
"and we had our hiccups and we had all sorts of  you know difficult moments for all of us where we all had to face ourselves and  you know i remember my little boy said, oh mum what about my christmas you know i was putting a lot of time into the the striker's christmas and he said how do you become a striker's child?"
"and it came home to me that you know we all had to come to terms in some way with erm  with what it was all about and the kids and you know and it became something of a  i mean it was the experience that we went through you know it was it was you know something that we'll always remember i think because it'll always make christmas different i think  for us in a way you know but it  and when they came up from south wales with car loads and van loads and i mean we all just sobbed you know i mean there was nothing to do really you know it was just  and i think  anyway that was christmas, but i mean er."
and we had expected rather a slump after christmas that hasn't happened really er you know we're just so busy i mean  one thing to the next really.
can you can you give me some idea the sort of flavour of erm how your meetings how they go now?
"well the men tend to come to our meetings and sit in the back now because their they well what in their words they say, oh they they're much better than the lodge meetings."
and erm we've got this big rally er which a fortnight ago julie suggested that we had a rally i think she thought er  you know that it was time we the public profile up sort of thing.
"and er she wanted er you know she has visions of us filling the streets of from  to   with banners waving and the we asked for no banners in the first rally we had back in october because we didn't want it to be seen as some thing that had you know big take over and everybody you know the communist party and the language people and er all the different factions being able to wave their banners you know, we support the blaenau quarry men."
and er but very definitely now i think we've got the self confidence that er you know we very much and er we feel established enough that everybody can bring their banners and it's gonna be a good day.
so the meetings are packed really with organizing and trying you know democratically to decide who we're going to have to speak and the balance of speakers and er where we're going to march from and who's gonna invite the band and who's gonna do this and who's gonna do that you know.
and the men erm as i say come along and sit in the back.
do do you the men actually take part?
yeah they do take part cos they're dying to say things  and we give them jobs to do.
no they they it's good you know it's er.
i think believe your your title has changed slightly has it from women's support group to the quarry men's support group?
oh i didn't know that actually  but er fine yes i mean er that sounds like a very good idea.
yeah.
when did that happen then?
i was just curious.
yes.
you or it's implied in what you're saying about the er the burgeoning self-confidence that people become responsible for  particular avenues.
mm.
erm do you see any danger in in that kind of specialization?
er that certain people won't feel involved do you mean ?
yes.
yes.
oh yes obviously er there is that element there always is and you have to out weigh i think you know creating sub committees that then er.
but our entertainments sub committee sort of er changes an people join it and you know er.
"as as i said we're we're not very formal but er you know that also has its especially if people that er maybe erm, how can i put it, are not used taking everything back to a meeting and you know they maybe make a decision and go ahead with it and then it gets shouted at a bit but i think we we can all take being shouted at ."
you know like i say there is quite a lot of trust and erm i think yona and me are aware er we're very much united in the feeling that we don't  we don't want things to erm you know we want everybody to be involved and obviously different people have different things to offer.
you implied erm that  many of the women who weren't really aware politically in in fact may have been quite restrained in that sense.
yes.
or unconscious.
yes.
have become possibly aware of erm politics and the way power flows?
yes i think you know i mean democracy  if i use  that word is supposed to be er by the people for the people isn't it you know but  i mean i'm always amazed.
before i became a councillor i didn't really realize about the three tiers of local democracy.
here you know you had the town council and the district and then the county.
and  you know  it is amazing what you can achieve really by  you know there is such a lot of scope really.
and it is this stupid business of  of in a way you know the whole idea that er it's beyond us you know.
"it's something for other people to do, do you know what i mean?"
and i mean i think women  tend to be having to cope with things like school and er and health and you know they're at the grass roots if you like of you know at the receiving end of you know say cuts in in services like that and bus services and just quality of rural life and i mean the quality of life in blaenau is depopulation and unemployment and you know and and in a sense there is lot of scope for women to break down the barriers of you know cos it is true that the the councillors they're supposed to represent the people or whatever tend to be quite well to do they've done it thank you very much and then oh you know they've got the time on their hands and they tend to be men and school ex school teachers ex  you know and they're not having to cope with really  situations that will put them what it's like not to have a bus service or not to have proper health care and this sort of thing you know.
so erm.
well i'm trying to you know just as a generalization now.
and i think erm  you know just that really.
do you predict that the the political nature of of the town will be will be changed in quite a fundamental way if and when the strike ends as a consequence of over this new ?
well yes it's it i dunno it's you know i don't know want to say  you know basically the facilities for change are really in the hands of of the politicians aren't they you know?
and if there's no work and if there's no means by which people can  get themselves  you know those sorts of basic things but  you know i'm not gonna i i couldn't say that the whole structure is going to change but i think erm i hope anyway and i do believe really that er  i mean i hope that we're going to stay together as a support group in some sort of form and  yes and there's no way that we're not going to support other causes in the way that we've been supported.
and i think that's that's a wonderful experience to realize that er you can be part of you know cos surely finally working men and women through history have never without sticking together they'd they'd still be back you know in the in the dark ages as far you know.
so it is i i i won't predict you know how it's gonna be too much you know because obviously er it's just the day to day living is quite difficult for most people have to work and cope with their families and you know so there's not going to be er that the fundamentals are are not gonna be changed and obviously people are gonna be very broke for a long time because in a strike situation you probably don't ever really quite recover.
i mean they've been on strike now for six months.
and erm.
"but i mean i think the feeling of the the miners were out for a year i mean time and time again i've heard people say, oh how how do they do it and look at the money they're sending us and look at what they're doing for us and how ."
you know they must be you know and a certain amount of guilt maybe that they that they didn't support the miners or you know it was something that was happening far away and maybe like i said you gave the odd tin of beans you know but er.
has there been any kind of surprise of the amount of support that you have got?
yes definitely i mean i don't think we ever dreamt in our wildest dreams i think  really it was maybe chance thing fate or whatever you know.
the network er what the miner's strike created i think anyway was a sort of network of people  and it wasn't just through the usual trade union political party network it was through the support groups really er  it sets up a network of like.
you know maybe a vacuum that needed to be filled by and they looked at the case of the quarry strike and it's so glaring obvious for men and women all over the country that it's er really a case of er  working men and women being erm  trampled upon really.
they were they were asking for them to make more slates for for less money and they weren't prepared to sit down and really talk it through with the men they just treated you know they just had this awful attitude.
that itself was a a surprise in in the town amongst the the women that the quarry men as being local people wouldn't talk with their own kind.
yeah i i dunno how much of a surprise.
i suspect that there'll there'd been a certain amount of alienation for a long time things that the men had to accept because the people with the money and therefore the power said that they had to you know i think quarry men are very proud on one level  great sort of craftsmen in a way and erm i'm sure that you know the last couple of years well i've heard them say really that there'd been things niggling them with the management but  i suppose  this was just like a blatant smack in the face and they realize that if they accepted this if they let the management walk all over them this was the thin end of the wedge you know that.
"and for the women you know i mean it's in a situation you probably i don't know you know this comment that, oh my my wife's gonna nag me back to work, or whatever that was made in the beginning probably could be that the women were saying, oh my god you know we can't afford to have you on strike just accept it you know just  i'm definitely not  i think really they have felt they have really changed fundamentally they've found a self confidence that they can say no you know it's not good enough."
and er certainly amanda who who's on strike then you know i mean they don't get equal pay the women the the the three women that came out i mean one of them's gone back an amanda and helen you know i mean they they were on they were on terribly low wages.
and i think amanda and helen certainly you know there's they found a self confidence that er feeling of what the union is all about as well you know.
"see history of the union is i mean er  but er you know it's a it's a process isn't it in in a way the management have are probably really kicking  themselves now  for what's happened you know i mean, their latest statement is er, well if there hadn't been so much outside interference i'm sure we'd have been able to settle."
you know i mean can you think of anything more ridiculous with there you go they probably haven't got any other leg to i mean that's no leg to stand on but they've got nothing else to say really you know.
is there and is there any kind of expected  amongst the support group that that the strike is going to end successfully?
well i dunno whether we  whether you'd when you're so close really.
i mean for me i i've gone beyond hoping in a way i mean it's just a question of keeping going from week to week and i don't know how to measure success.
i know it it sounds sounds strange really it is really strange.
in the beginning i just hoped and prayed that it would be over next week.
and in a way it's become easier as the times this might sound funny as the times gone on.
almost we can go on forever if that's how it's got to be.
you know it's a sort of what's got to be has got to be in a sense i mean there's no going back now there's no surely finally every every strike is settled in the end and they've got to come and talk.
everybody's got to sit down and talk eventually and something has got to be worked out and that's got to happen we know that.
and meanwhile we'll keep going you know and er and do what we have to do which is to make sure that when they get when they get round to that table sitting down that well certainly the the quarry men are not gonna be hungry if if you know what i mean i mean they they gonna sit there  with full bellies  in a sense that they're not gonna be starved back and i mean that sounds rather dramatic and a cliched but i mean when you're living on the bread line and expecting money from week to week i mean that's what it's all about isn't it you know and and the food parcel.
we first of all we used to give the food parcel every fortnight because it was half one week and half the next and now it's a food parcel every week so they they're guaranteed that basic sustenance you know and erm and we'll keep up the up up the fund raising and the money's certainly still pouring in.
i mean the the funds having dropped .
and if if it does start dropping we're gonna have to change our tactics and go and do something else you know we'll we'll  knock on anybody's doors  do you know what i mean we're not proud and we'll go you know we'll just change our tactics and er whatever it takes.
and i think i'm i speak for er  you know so so if that's success then yes you know then then it's it's got to you know i dunno.
do you think that the management are aware that they are now dealing with people who've changed?
well like i said i think  probably they're  really kicking themselves i mean i would be in their situation.
"you know and this statement that, oh it's outside interference if these students hadn't come up to picket."
well i mean it's a ridiculous statement isn't it?
you know i mean because all the people that have come to show support and er solidarity have done it er i mean we've been very aware you know the quarry men have actually said you know no we don't want you to actually block the land rovers we do it our own way and erm  you know there's been no  control mass picketing or violence or anything like that.
so i mean and if and surely if they're talking about actual support food and money i mean can they really.
you know in a way south wales is paying back the debt that we we paid them in their strike you know i mean and that's communities helping communities and if really this management is talking about er the fact that they resent families not having to go without over christmas and this sort of thing you know i mean where are their values you know it's difficult to understand isn't it?
is there any  hint that you might be forced to make an an inversion in that sense that er you would be able you would have to make statements like that  as you've made you you've turned them that the employer's statement on it's head?
erm how do you mean exactly?
well in in the sense that erm they've said referred to outside interference.
mm.
and you said well if they mean you know support from from people in south wales who.
mm.
are stopping people starving.
mm.
i mean have you have you actually made that comment ?
well this came up actually on a on a radio er chat thing that was open to the public in blaenau ffestiniog last night er where the chair was saying erm well you know i mean a lot of the  a lot of the people that haven't been very involved in this strike that i think should have been involved.
i mean myself as a councillor i think if you're a councillor you should be involved in the strike in one way or another you know.
i mean all this sitting on the fence i mean they must have very sore bums .
i mean i dunno whether it's because they don't want to lose votes or you know i mean they they were there pontificating about we should all come little children and let's talk.
er we've all got to be friends in a situation let bygones be bygones .
well i mean it's gone much beyond that i mean they the reality of the situation is er is not like that i'm afraid i mean it  eighteen men have been sacked and and these are men that have put those quarries where they are.
you know they they're a lot of the older men makes you wonder have they been sacked so they don't have to pay them hand shakes at the end you know if they wanted to lay some people off.
cos you know we're all aware that in this sort of new technological new machinery the new machinery versus a lot of skilled labour is is a difficult debate isn't it you know and  but you can't.
in nineteen eighty six  treat people their labour is worth nothing you know those men have given their lives to the quarry industry and there's no doubt that there is money to be made from slate at the moment and people are people that have the money to invest are making a lot of money okay they're they're risking the money but er people are risking their lives and giving their lives.
you seem to suggest that there is quite a and quite a a different relationship between the quarry men er and the quarry owner than there is normally between say a employer and an employee.
that the quarry man somehow has has an investment in the erm in the rock in than than what he receives in wages.
yes i wouldn't like to say too much about this you know i'm i'm only a farmer i'm no expert on these you know just from things i feel really erm.
"i think historically  although you know  historians can   much better than me, erm historically maybe the way that the rock has been worked with a bagging system and it was you know and lots of quarry men had little bits of farm around blaenau especially and you get a feeling er from reading about it that er you know they have a an almost self employed attitude to their to their work and their rock and the fact that er they'd do it in their own you know work the rock in a certain way and this and very proud erm of their work and that and from talking a lot to them and being close to you know it you feel that that that's still very much the same really you know there is this sort of close relationship and that with their employers there was you know a lot of  you know wasn't it wasn't straight it as straight as you said a straight employer employee relationship that they was  a lot of er give and take probably and i think they were outraged at this sort of mcgregor type tactic really that you know this new machine."
they were prepared to compromise because they i'm sure that you know you can't imagine them not being really but because they're such erm  they were outraged at this machine but they were prepared to give it a try but the way it was bulldozed through that once the machine was there there was no choice then and almost you know get going boys get more and more and more slate you know greed they felt the employer was being greedy at the expense of quality.
"and really the slate industry i think probably hinges on quality being maintained you know i mean like i said i don't want to go in you know i'm no expert on this sort of thing but erm  a deep sense of of injustice i think is that and, oh my god if if we let him start making us just you know like robots produce more and more slate and laying off some of the older craftsmen and you know they do and david price who knows and i mean they put that  and and  then they the last fifteen years it was a it was a defunct slate quarry before you know and they  i mean it's not as it's not an easy thing to er work slate i'm sure it's difficult  and you have to know what you're doing."
are you  are you saying in fact that the erm that the the success of those of the rebirth of the slate industry in  has depended largely upon erm these mens skill erm the investment of the quarry owners?
oh i think there's no doubt about that and also their their their wages were low in the beginning you know and and their their their hard work that they've put into it for the last you know  i mean it had it i mean david price says at the best of times is not easy to run a quarry you know you know and they they all work in a quarry so it had to be a cooperation and you know the management said you come up with us and and they weren't complaining actually about the wages it was quite good wages for.
mind you it was only their wages are only comparable to say some wages that they get in nuclear power station.
i mean it's only fair it's not we're not talking about huge wages but for gwynedd which is a low wage area they were reasonable and they worked for them too you know but but they weren't complaining about the money the principle.
and there are records of this everywhere aren't there you know and and probably you know the the management thought er i don't know if they thought this far really or we'll we'll show them that they can't that they can't stick together as a union and why should all the quarries stick together.
i mean the management are quite prepared to stick together when it comes to getting grants as the ffestiniog slate company.
but when it suits them they choose not to be seen and seen you know sort of divide and rule tactics of seen as different entities really and i mean to be how dare and one one comment was how dare these men gang up against us.
well i mean you know we're not playing children's ganging up games are we we know we're dealing with peoples' lives and families.
you refer to the er network which is erm become consolidated in the miner's strike and.
mm.
the dispute here.
can you describe it in in in some bit of detail?
well you know just loosely really there's the contacts that people i mean.
one of the initiatives er was er the congress the all wales congress that was set up in the miner's strike .
"but i don't think it really ever i mean there were quite a lot of initiatives like that you know of people thinking of different ways really of of sticking together to combat er you know what i've been talking about which was smashing unionism and er forcing lower wages really onto the the already low paid, which er really seems to be what thatcher's all about you know to er curb inflation and create a very divided society where er half the population seem to have to live either on the dole or in in poverty really in in derelict bits of britain."
erm while the rest er live in the lap of luxury i mean maybe that's a  well i don't know i don't think it is an exaggeration really the way things are heading.
and these sorts of initiatives of of people organizing together you know .
oh i had a huge list of names really you know of erm you know we had quite big meetings where people seem to have come their parties  their sort of  sectarianism really you know which er the left is notorious for if you like if you want to use cliches.
and er you know rally round and i think it's no more than that really no more or no less you know it's er.
"and certainly you know i mean yona's list now of support for this next rally we've got on march the first is huge i mean it's and that's not gonna go away is it you know i mean next year i don't know what we're gonna be but  hopefully we'll be supporting somebody else in their er struggle for fair play and that network will obviously come into play you know i mean i've we've been south wales have said, oh you know these are all our contacts you know some of the women in south wales and in deeside they've said these are all our contacts and these are the people that were good and did the work and got the leaflets out and brought the money in you know and it's as simple as that really you know."
the people who've erm who've really helped you in  in very substantial way do you go and see them?
yeah well we're each another you know quite a lot of people have visited us.
obviously at the moment we we all of us are really tied up with living from a tuesday to a saturday really you know with tuesdays our meeting and then all that has to be done after that and then saturday is the food parcels you know so and most people work either part time or full time work at home er with the kids and bringing up families so and obviously also money is short for people that are directly involved in the strike so erm.
no we're not all rushing off all over the place although the men and some of the women you know we have gone off and they still i mean the men were in south wales last week.
a lot of people have come up to visit so in those term you know yes we do yeah er seeing but erm you know we don't have  a lot of spare time  either.
can you give me some idea of your relationship with the erm the lodge?
i mean is it possible to draw a comparison between the way it erm you know the women were regarded before they became so effective?
oh well erm i don't know really it's er.
i've only been to a couple of lodge meetings it i was invited to go to i always felt slightly ambiguous about that really you know.
you know we tend to hover outside lodge meetings you know cos it is all men you know and  it's quite frightening really you know i mean this erm  i think  the way the finances are worked er.
"you know we were asked, do you want your own bank account really and we decided er democratically that we'd have the one bank account really for make sure the d h s s didn't start snooping really and you know er  that's worked very well i mean certainly the men very much tell us everything that's going on and erm well  you know i don't think there's any conflict of erm i don't know you know it's it's difficult i suppose it's amazing really the way it does work you know and that er you know but it's quite loose really because it's er that's in a way the way one of it's successes probably you know that's it's not a very structured i mean probably the lodge is more structured i mean men are used to their lodge meetings aren't they you know?"
i mean we're so busy with our own we don't really you know we don't we don't feel upstaged by the lodge  i think  you know we just work together really you know because it makes sense you know i don't think there's no big.
and yet the erm the men have started to come to your meetings?
yes they do they  it's it's yeah they they liked to erm i think they felt a bit shy in the beginning  and yet you know.
how did they did they begin in in ones or twos?
yes david price used to you know er sit in our meetings yeah as a treasurer it made sense you know our treasurer and him to work together and all that.
"and er they happen came along er to tell us about the aberystwyth trip we went off to aberystwyth the students gave us a party and he said, oh i like your meetings  i wish i could come here more often ."
and erm you know they they they tend to meet before us on a tuesday and they stay  hang around .
you know often they don't stay through the whole meeting but if they've got specific points to bring up you know you know it's flexible really you know what's going on really.
and tom jones stayed in one of our meetings a couple of months ago.
"i think he was nervous  really he thought, oh my gosh you know that these are one of the big pickets that happened erm what are the women going to plan next you know and he felt you know tom's you know felt control of it really i think he was very impressed with er."
i i hope so i think it was er er we bridged you know i mean maybe you know it's often the way isn't it you know you think that's something going on and you think it's different to what it is when he realized we were all very level headed and that er.
at that moment it had been appropriate to put big pickets you know i think if we thought too much about it we would have and taken it to the lodge and put it through the union it would have had cold water put over it and  you know it was right for tom to be wary and it was probably right for us to do what we did i mean i think you know it it was successful the way it turned out.
i mean it could have been different it could have got control and then everybody would have turned and pointed a finger and that would have been awful.
but that's also the nature of the way things are really isn't it you know?
i mean probably women are more daring you know because they've got less to lose in a way i suppose if you if you're not a councillor  you can be more er you know or if you're not worried for your job or you know or if there isn't a definite structure i suppose in the lodge there's the definite people that always say the same things you know what i mean and it's it's less easy to be spontaneous in that situation i would think you know.
so erm  i mean i think we're definitely seen by the men  as as the more  as the more brave in in a way you know.
d'ya do you think they've erm really learnt anything from you?
well i dunno whether i i'm in a position to comment on that  you know you'll have to ask them about that whether you know we've all learnt from really.
well erm david said that he didn't think the strike would have gone on or they wouldn't have the heart to go on without the women?
yes that has been said yes that er  well i suppose also it's a joint effort isn't it you know if.
i mean the strain on families must be enormous in a strike situation and for both people in the family to be having an input and feeling that they're getting some sort of feedback from the situation that it's not just despair must surely you know be you know there's that side to it and then erm from the women's point of view i mean we have like i said become one big family in a way you know and the social side of the strike in a way you know people are you know going out more maybe and certainly.
what can i do for you today?
"erm i came to see you a few weeks ago  at night you know er it's just like i'm just filling up, you know, with mucus and stuff and coughing and i had er no sleep for about a week."
"i went on holiday, i thought."
aha.
it was hay fever.
yeah.
"and it and it actually cleared up, got better while i were on holiday."
i've been back a week.
"u give you some anti histamines, did they make any difference ?"
no.
oh dear.
right are you actually getting wheezy with this?
"yes, very wheezy, yeah ."
right.
do you find you cough when you run around?
"i've er i've only just i've only been coughing the last couple of days, but."
yeah.
"i i mean i mean i've been up since half past three this morning,."
you wake in the early hours?
i was.
yeah.
going to ask that as my next question.
yeah.
right let's have a listen because this sounds this sounds slightly different from last time.
certainly.
yeah.
sounds less like hay fever i must say.
yeah.
"now er somewhere we have one of those,right let's have a listen then."
just undo another  do you smoke?
no.
good.
what job do you do?
erm mechanic at  place.
nice deep breath.
oops.
picture of something in   everywhere.
hmm mm.
you haven't been anywhere exotic have you?
no.
"i've only been to devon and cornwall, you can't really call."
no you're not getting.
much there.
and you haven't been abroad in the past six months?
no.
"okay,."
never had.
right.
"what you do with this is take a big breath,."
yeah.
put it your mouth and blow out as hard and as fast as you can.
"it'll make you cough probably, and keep your fingers off the off the."
sorry.
scale.
it's okay.
right big blast.
you actually put it in your mouth.
sorry.
it's alright.
"oh dear, is that as hard and as fast as you can manage?"
well i can i can have another try if you want.
you're blowing out your birthday cake candle.
yeah.
you remember the story bit about the big black wolf who.
yeah.
blow the little piggies house down.
well that's what you're blasting at.
that's how you blast through one of these.
"yeah, yeah."
i'm sorry.
well i did tell you it'd make you cough.
yeah.
yes.
hmm.
it's not very good is it?
it's under four hundred.
and.
mm.
you should be probably around six fifty.
given your build and height and age.
yeah.
"now the story's much more that of late onset asthma,."
yeah.
now a lot of asthmatics get it when they're fairly young.
but you can get it in for the first time at any age.
and.
mm.
it may well be allergy mediated to pollen or dust or something like that.
so it may just be a seasonal thing.
but i i think the diagnosis is asthma or what ever whatever's triggered it off.
and we need to treat you along those lines.
now.
the drugs of choice for asthma are inhaled drugs.
yeah.
"then you can use very small doses, they go straight to the lungs, and."
mm.
they work without any particular side effects.
"and you can use inhalers like this, or you can use inhalers like this."
mm.
you can use inhalers like this puffer type.
yeah.
okay.
"and what i suggest we do is seeing georgina's here we send you through to see georgina and she can, if she's got time, we can briefly run through one or two types."
see which.
mm.
suits you best.
yeah.
er.
"what what what i can't understand, i can be alright, at the day, and as."
yeah.
soon as it comes to to night time i.
yeah.
can feel me eyes getting sore.
yeah.
"and then it comes on and by the time two or three o'clock i'm i'm a wreck, even."
yeah.
"i haven't had a shave, even the bristles, everything."
yeah.
seems dead sensitive .
"yeah , that's right."
i i.
is that.
well it.
yeah.
asthma tends to flare up at various times it'll it tends.
yeah.
"to flare up with exertion,er and it has what's called a diurnal rhythm so the body's natural rhythms affect it."
mm.
and so it tends to be worse in the early hours of the morning and you can have another blip in the sort of er middle to late afternoon .
"when your sort of body's running down anyway, you know it's it's a few hours after dinner time, it's not quite time to go home from work."
it's a natural time to get tired and you can have a blip ten .
mhm.
"er and things like sort of er midday and a late evening er usually fine, and then you have quite a lot of asthmatics say they wake up in the night, somewhere between two to five."
and.
mm.
it's very very common.
what i think we'll do to start off with is to just put you on one inhaler and see how well you respond and if you only need it every now and again we don't need to do anything else.
some asthmatics need to be some on treatment on a in a regular preventative basis.
mhm.
in the same way we was giving people blood pressure tablets to take every day.
whether.
mm.
they feel well or not.
i think to start off with we'll just give you something to relive the symptoms.
yeah.
"and see what you need, so er."
"i mean it's been been really bad as you know i you know as er i don't know what to do with myself, you know."
yeah.
it course   no sleep at night .
and walking about in.
right you've only got a wheeze there's no evidence of.
yeah.
"an an infection, there."
there's no crackles and it's expanding well and it peaks  three eight two which is okay but it's quite down on what it should be.
so you're going  either ventalin or briconil and we're going ask georgina to see if she's free.
okay?
"right, thank you."
"er and then we'll see what device cos i mean there's there's a couple more devices those, and you know different people are suited to different ones."
there's no point in me giving you type a when type b's better for you.
yeah.
so we'll ask her to run through and see what's what.
okay?
follow me.
right.
there's nothing wrong with those.
they're perfect.
"absolutely perfect, now."
why is she.
erm.
getting her.
"well she thinks you're on a high dose, you're not, you're on an okay dose."
now we've had you that's right.
we're we're waiting inn here we're still on three months so we're alright.
"so mid october, so we've actually."
mm.
got a a a while to go yet before we decide what we're going to do with that.
"but your levels are perfect, okay, it's got nothing to do with lithium."
no i i think it's just a really bad case of m e again .
"yeah , yeah."
well she she told me that your m e type symptoms had got worse and i said that's we had at that's what i chatted with her about the other day but.
i've i've been really housebound for five.
mm.
"weeks now,."
yeah.
and it's driving me mad.
i i'm.
yeah.
you know i feel just.
mm.
dreadful.
yeah.
but it but it is typical m e symptom .
"well that's right, a sort of low achy, tired, tired."
yeah.
and more tired.
that's right and i'm very depressed.
yeah.
are you are i mean obviously you are keeping yourself going cos you're obviously getting out to come here and do bits and bobs but.
well this is the first time i've been.
yeah.
able to come here on my own.
yeah.
"erm and that's not like me, i usually."
manage to you know .
"now you're usually okay, aren't you ?"
yeah but er it really has knocked me for six this time.
mhm.
erm i think it's probably that infection that i had er.
yes.
it may well be .
that thrush or whatever it was .
yeah.
yeah.
"er it takes very little, well you know yourself."
mm.
don't you?
yeah.
"i mean i found it in the past, you know any infection what so ever just knocks you for six."
"and and i'm just, you know, i i think that's probably why jo was."
mm.
i think i she'd seen me at my worst on friday.
yeah.
and and.
yeah.
i think it worried her .
yeah.
yeah.
but er your lithium levels are absolutely fine.
they're almost exactly the same as you were four weeks ago.
i thought they were actually cos i i even at that part of.
yeah.
it it felt.
yeah.
erm.
yeah.
yeah.
normal .
yeah.
good.
i mean the headaches are i'm reluctant to say  better.
"yeah, but not so."
but.
bad.
but they're certainly not so severe.
yeah.
do you find they respond better if you take dihydrocodeine when they're there ?
yes.
yeah.
yeah.
exactly what i's expect and you may find they actually are on a down-slope still.
and maybe it's a very shallow down-slope but still on a down-slope.
mm.
and that's what i'd.
i do actually feel better.
i i eat i don't usually take my first lot of tablets till sort of around dinner time.
and i find about an hour or so afterwards i do.
actually start to feel.
anyhow we're we're gonna summarize.
"your lithium in october , that's."
mhm.
and that's fine.
what i.
would apart as far as the levels are concerned i'd check them again in erm no hang on we've just checked them.
i'd probably check them in october again.
"two months, cos you seem stable ."
two months.
you seem unless you get any particular.
mhm.
to it i would recheck that in october.
and then when we see you then we're going to sort summarize what three months on effected levels of lithium has done for you.
to decide whether to continue .
is it a drug that you can stay on?
they've got people who've been on it for years and years.
mm.
you've got to keep checking the level.
mm.
"it it's a funny little drug it's related to sodium, old sodium, you've got loads of sodium."
you take it it everyday as with salt.
er but it can replace sodium in certain systems of the body.
in fact that's how it seems to work.
"but that you've got to watch it's effect on the kidneys, on the body biochemistry."
mm.
so that's what we have to check .
mm.
but it's very very safe provided you keep in within the sort of dosage like driving on the motorway.
it's safe if you stick to the speed limit.
mm.
usually.
could you give me some more of that.
hormone cream?
yes.
i was going to ask how you'd gone with that.
well it's better but it's not right .
yeah.
yeah.
well you've only.
mm.
been on it a fortnight.
yeah.
so er but.
find i'm down to using it twice a week now .
twice a week.
yeah.
so i haven't.
yeah.
used it this week.
"alright, okay."
yeah.
but it's certainly an improvement.
yeah.
to what it was.
oh good good.
i mean the advantage of that is you get you get the local benefits without generalized side-effects.
mm.
er and that can be a problem with some folk when you try to manipulate the hormones like that.
"but i'm actually using more and more of this cream, as i realize that er if you direct it towards the right part of the body in the right people,."
mm.
it works extremely well.
as i say it's just erm overall feeling generally.
well i mean.
horrible.
and you know to some extent it's just time and keeping yourself ticking over that's going to get that aspect of things better.
yeah.
and that's frustrating for you and it's equally frustrating for me because i know there's absolutely nothing i can do.
that's right.
to effect that.
"but it's important we keep an eye on the other things, keep other things ticking over and things like the hormone cream and the lithium will be a help in that."
yeah.
i mean sometimes  just by resting really er you know puts me back again but er it hasn't.
yeah yeah.
don't overdo the rest.
well i were going to say i can't rest.
you've got to find a compromise.
i mean it's it's always a i mean the whole of life is a compromise but especially with this.
"the compromise between resting when you feel very very tired, and keeping yourself going so you don't seize up."
mm.
but you can't overdo the mobility cos you get very very tired.
yeah.
"well i've been you know, very conscious of that."
and i and when you've had it a long time you.
mm.
become and i'm not the sort of person to sit around willy nilly any way.
"but my legs  my legs are  like jelly, my body's like rubber, you know."
and i oof.
ooh i get so mad.
keep other bits of you going.
okay?
when when do you want to see me again?
well.
"all else being equal, i would say october with the lithium level and then we're gonna have our review of lithium."
okay?
if anything flares up that's fine.
"there should be enough cream there now for four to six weeks on a twice weekly basis, but if you run out just give a ring in."
right.
that's fine.
well i'll need my other tablets.
yeah.
well you'll need those anyway.
so er.
thank you.
hello.
what can we do for you today?
"er well, i've had a sore throat."
it's about three weeks now.
"the er not a sore throat you know, it's there for a couple of days and then it eases off, i think it's getting better and then."
the next day it's as bad as ever.
as bad as ever.
"this morning i can feel it, but last night it was i was when i swallowed there was a big lump."
like a lump at the back?
erm.
mm.
. stick your tongue out.
"oh, aye,a way down, see just in through there?"
aha.
"down the sides there, not up beside your tonsils."
it's a way down the back.
right.
and see that wee thing that hangs down the back?
that's what.
aha.
and it's rubbing up against your tongue.
aye.
that's what you're feeling .
but i didn't feel it as bad this morning.
no.
that's right.
oh no.
aye..
"up here and i, i've been keeping putting it off and putting it off."
"it, it comes back into  it, some, some nights it's quite good and then other nights it feels all."
aye.
it's.
dry and it feels like.
"ah, aye, i'm not."
in the morning.
i've a right cough and a tickle and.
that's .
what i'm bringing up.
it's.
aye.
filthy.

"erm aye, i can do."

kind of choke down.
again.
it might well be coming.
i've.
from there.
"see i've had a couple of colds the past few months and then you think, well that's me, i'm getting better."
and then the next morning i'm up i feel as i was going to take it again.
it feels all choked up again.
aye.
right.
er it sounds it might well be stuck in your sinuses here and this stuff's running down the back.
mhm.
and landing in the back of your throat here.
"er you're what,?"
aye.
three.
"now, i've given you some antibiotics."
they're to take during the day.
and i've given you special stuff for nighttime to keep the back of your throat clear at night.
because that's half the battle if you can keep.
"nights, i didn't have a decent night's sleep just for the tickle you know, the ."
"that's right, the continual it's this continual stuff running down the back that goes for it."
mhm.
oops!
there we are.
"right,."
thanks doctor.
mrs .
i wonder if i could show you a mole?
"i've got, i feel it's getting  and i don't know if it's erm to be."
i've had it for years and never bothered.
"aye, i know but  they change."
let's look.
yeah.
it's starting to get black at one side alright.
you see i cannot not see it.
no.
but i just felt it.

i'm not scratching it because i can't scratch it but.
no.
i'm worried about it.
yeah.
well i think you better get this seen to.
"it's, there's a tiny wee corner at the top there where the colour's changing."

and there's another wee bit there.
aye.
get it off.
right.
get it off.
i've been going to come up about it and.
aye.
"it's, och aye, it's one of these things."
do you think it.
"i've had it for all this time, i hope."
yeah.
well it wouldn't make.
any difference.
"now, all i need for you to go and see the skin specialist and  get it in the bucket and then there's."
right.
no worry about it.

"yeah, i mean that's that's not a problem any more."

but if you actually deliberately ask them to write promptly.
and the eye department.
"are quite good actually, it must be said."
right.
bye bye.
good.
thanks very much.
that's okay.
.
"yes i think that probably this had been er very wise in this er in i'm not saying that they've helped us or anything but they've kept the middle of the line and erm  in the beginning when things were beginning to whatsit er the inspector sent two policemen down here and asked me would i ask the lads not to do any damage to property and all this, and that and said, right there's a lodge tonight and i shall ask them i shall tell them to do that."
and er why he sent for me because i'm not a shop steward or anything.
but as i said before probably it's the white hair that er  that does it .
"so  what they had done it had a big slab there and it had got on it er  the world's largest slate mine, and perhaps you've seen it yourself they've rubbed the t off and they put v and somebody's done a very good job of it er in the same paint and everything."
so tourists have been stopping even to take photo of that the largest slave in the world.
i mean that's not the right description of it  but er anyway.
"now will brought down an old van er which was scrap it was quite a good body i mean and he painted on it, we're still open, er something like, despite transport and general workers' union picketing we are fully open, and he plonked this van with no wheels on it just the body right in the entrance of on his own ground naturally er right the pickets which was like you know tantalizing."
naturally he he wanted to keep his place open and when he got up the next morning somebody had painted the side of the van completely over.
so and smashed all the windows and everything in it erm so what's that and as i say it was only a scrap van er and now he'd bought the little chapel on the corner.
er there were lots of er little panes broken before but er whether our lads were having a bit of a pot shot.
i mean when you're on picket line it's very depressing it's very heart breaking unless you get some comedian or something you know it gets er you don't know what to do with yourself and perhaps they'd been taking pots of this paint i'm not saying.
"so i asked them in the lodge like don't do any damage and tom was in he gave them a good lecture  so  and the lads in the lodge said, well look you tell them not to do this attitude and perhaps you've seen it on these flumes when they saw a crowd that was there they were changing gear with the land rover and through you know like anybody in the way you'd be underneath."
so i said fair enough.
"well the next morning i was up at the top gate on picket and erm  came with his van and he he spelted up through and the lads jumped one side well, i'm nearly sixty five i didn't jump so quickly."
and i don't i don't think i tried jumping.
"and i think he meant, and i say this quite fair now, i think he meant to come straight up to me and brake suddenly to frighten me."
but he missed his trick and he came too far and he knocked me over and i was underneath the front of the van.
well  naturally i was  i was raving wild when i got up and that's well the lads i thought they were going to turn the van over tell you the truth.
"and course he'd frightened himself and er i counted about eight, nine and ten i said to him, look  when you go inside that bloody gate now i said go straight into the office sit down and think for a minute where the hell are we all going to in this carry on?"
and i don't where i got i gave him quite a good sermon which i thought was know quite erm to try and help the situation and he said i'd give them er my conditions.
"i said, while you adopt them that you'd give them your conditions we're getting nowhere."
and i said you sit quietly and think and we shall do the same.
and erm  he was still at them and then that he was in the right.
"and said why'll well why'd you'd dogmatic about it, i said we can't never be solve it."
"anyway in the end he went in and erm the next thing the inspector came up and er he called me and the union chap into his car and er he said, we got a mark i said yeah well i had a little scar across me knee."
"so he said, erm do you want to press charges?"
i i's thinking well this long would make the blinking situation worse and we're trying to resolve it.
"i said, no i don't."
and he only had to wait a couple of erm points left on his licence  so if i'd taken the dangerous thriving or something  he could have lost his licence but erm that's besides the point.
"at the moment i thought, no the best thing was to forget it and that's what we did."
and i'm not sorry that i did that because erm i wouldn't like i wouldn't have like to think that er anything i'd done had escalated the situation you know.
and erm then the inspector then found out if this scum works is going to carry on charging through these men.
"and as i say we did the mass picket down in  inspector was coming straight up the sergeant to you know what's like to leading er people and he said, now what's the what you going to do what's what you want this morning?"
"and we used to say, well we want to stop the land rover."
right there'll be no punch-ups no nothing just one person to speak er to the driver or whoever he wants to speak to.
yes right.
well in that case and they'd been stopping them for us you see and er  excuse me stopping them for us and whoever decided to speak to them has had his few words and that's it carry on.
well the other morning we were there and everything was quite in order what the police were afraid that somebody was going to get hurt.
and when we were getting people from outside coming there and some of them quite militant they were going to sit and lay across the road.
naturally police didn't want that.
"so we thought, no if we can stop them to speak to them cos at the end of the day we can't actually stop them going up, we can give them as much harassment as we can yes er and keep within the law."
"well as i say, the police stopped them the other morning and one of the lads had a chat with the driver and all this and he carried on."
well after they went round the corner one of these erm well stupid young lads in the back er lifted his two fingers on the pickets.
but you see the sergeant saw him.
"and the first thing he said, oh who's that bloke?"
and he got his name and he was up in the quarry during the morning and he's giving him his final warning that if he does that again he'll book him.
because he's really agitating the situation.
"and the same person, this young lad, i know he young stupid but erm i mean er i've had many a black eye for er speaking listening but er perhaps he'll  be learnt the same way."
erm he goes round the pubs and he agitates on these lads.
the lads that are on strike well i mean you'd think it'd be him being like a blackleg er that's er they'd be agitating but he's .
i don't know if he's looking for trouble and that er would undermine er what public er relations and everything and we don't want that.
but erm unless he alters his way you know i can see it coming off.
but erm i think the police realize that he is a bit of an agitator and he's not to strike that's wrong.
yeah.
has there been any sort conflict open open to in the in the town ?
"i think there've been one or two not er brush ups you know in the pubs once er or twice, they er they won't drink with them and that and er some of the lads some of the lads that have gone back have really realized the situation they've put themselves in you know, and they sorry and now they're on they don't know which way to turn."
i mean i feel sorry for them erm they've put themselves in a position branded forever more or less.
one lad went back because his father went back.
they did work in er two worked in two different quarries but within a week or a fortnight that young lad approached one of our members and said he's sorry that he'd ever gone back and i  said to him well come back and join us and forget it all.
and he's back in the lodge he's on less money but but he's much happier so.
he's he's out?
he's he's out yes and there are two or three in  which have erm  you know they're sorry that they've gone back and er we feel sorry for them that they've dropped into  and a lot of our young lads have got mortgages and all that but there are some gone back  er they need not  people erm they'd finished rearing their families and everything.
and erm if they could have given us a proper explanation why they'd gone back and prove us wrong them fair enough.
but i think they'd just gone back for the money creed and once you get that well erm they don't realize that they could be falling into the trap unless we blokes stand firm now to maintain this standard of living.
well their standard of living will come come down.
right they're getting everything they want at the moment because erm er  ease the situation.
"but i mean once this strike is over, unless we come to proper agreement erm they know then that then it will be too late then cos there's somebody saying then they came for the jews first was it?"
i wasn't a jew so i didn't bother.
"and then they came for the communists, i wasn't a communist so i didn't bother."
and if i remember they came then they came for the trade unionist.
i wasn't a trade unionist so i didn't bother.
then they came for me and then there was nobody to bother and that was the end of it.
and.
it works in this situation the same.
and erm  you know er sometimes i'm sorry that it's come to this because like this family er they made a bomb it we're not saying that we're not denying them that .
"we've had a good living it but if that same system has brought them on their feet, you know and built them nice homes er right they've delved into company's house now, all the dirty water not dirty water all the whatsit has come up how much they've drawn from these quarries."
i mean  used to say quite often erm er i'd i'd erm show my pay packet against your's any day if we had a good week.
we were much better off than him.
well yes because he had a mercedes benz which er with cherish number plates which the company buys him.
the company runs for him.
you know it's come the tax situation he's built himself a er massive big house or put an extension on it.
the extension is bigger than the original house.
we're not saying that that er has been done er through all the cheap channels  i don't blame him probably do the same.
but he wasn't saying that he was getting eighteen thousand a year from ffestiniog slate alone as a director's bonus and he's a director of the other quarries .
so how much is he getting?
er not trying to kid us that er he's worse off than us.
well never can he and er the other partners with er   the plant hire that's been going for donkey's ages and never shows a profit.
"but i mean erm er figures can lie and liars can figure and he comes back well now when you go into company's house and get all these things, how much they putting aside of the money which should erm like er they can get a good pension, well that money it doesn't come actual from their pocket, it comes from the company's funds which er really would have gone to the tax man."
so er you know they're making their bed er nice and feathery and yet they denying it us and then that's where the erm the sore point comes in.
you mentioned earlier on  about your attitude towards the erm minerals and mining.
yeah.
is it i mean has your attitude you know that because it's under your feet is to use your expression.
yeah.
that that it it is in fact something that ought to be shared more and people ought to benefit more from what's here?
oh yes definitely.
yes erm  excuse me.
er reading old books there they talk about the  and er around  and the  beds and all that you know and the jollity people they're well known about it .
"my wife and my daughters are all erm great c n d and nuclear er whatsit people, so now when these people wanted to drill in  way, drill for er geological mineral er  estuary cos that's a different story the  estuary."
"er they were erm er all the c n d group, i'm saying this now with no disrespect or anything."
they were erm reluctant and were going to fight against it cos they thought they were going to look for er places to bury nuclear waste and it was shelved but i can't prove them right and i can't prove them wrong.
"but definitely they should er explore this county and not erm  wanted to come into i think it was  into the  estuary to drill for gold and minerals all that, and the planning of the national park said, no, and the blinking hole is only about four inches wide."
what i think should be done  at that time was  that the government should be fifty percent shares in it anything that's er sample that's brought up they should know what it is.
"because in one county there was erm i'm not sure it was ireland was a big erm hired firm like that came, they explored round they paid so many hundred to each farmer for exploring the land and he said, oh no we've found nothing."
a few hundred quid was smashing.
as the years went by these farms were bought up.
they didn't know by people were paying good money for them as er the farmers were moving out and it was er a good copper bed.
"but you see they didn't know the truth of the exploration, but if the government was fifty fifty in it they'd be entitled to know the exact amount and quantity and what was underneath your feet."
and i still maintain er they use the old argument that er tapes and all this and erm they er scar the countryside.
"well to me when i come home of the crimean i look at these massive tips you know in blaenau  on your left and the old  on the right and that, erm if the old man that first rucked his pick and shovel or whatever trussel and  or whatever they started would have known what he was starting then, it was like the klondike of wales."
i mean i i'd love to see the the whole history and that's why i'm glad that erm you people are taking an interest now in not helping us but some day somebody saying who's that crank  who's been talking on there .
"but erm no i think we should take full advantage of it we we're sitting on erm you know good minerals because as the minerals of the world getting erm shorter in 'sit erm in africa they're getting all the copper its getting, well now they're shifting their interest slowly into anglesey."
as the minerals are getting er er slightly scarer scarcer well the percentage value of erm is it's working now.
can't see why we shouldn't er take advantage of it.
"but i mean you don't want to er start working in the mines for peanuts or anything do you, you want it to be a good job everybody else."
erm throughout this you know since we've since we've been talking you you very clearly have given me erm picture of the people who own the quarries and own the and have the erm  of the directories.
mm.
they are very much local people.
ah yes.
and erm members of local families.
yes.
"i remember glyn   and the kids were very young i think some of the were born in blaenau erm and they were dismantling an old quarry at  there his brother w r  from harlech had bought it usa like a machinery merchant and glyn then borrowed a lot of tools off me for dismantling it then we started we we'd done a lot off and on together we'd been in  er i enjoyed working with him, he was the type of man very hard worker himself but he wanted his pound of flesh."
er you know while you're working er there was no you had to stop him sometimes because he'd kill himself ha ha that's it.
"yes he's built a business up and i'm not denying him that er or anything , but somehow now er i don't know whether the wheel is turning too fast for him to keep up with it or whether it's erm oh never mind the erm the industry of the locality, providing the money stakes a i know every business has got to pay for itself and that we we're not, if this quarry was on the down grade and er er somebody had come to us said, look unless you take a drop in your wages er we can't survive that would be a different issue altogether."
"but it's not, it's flourishing and there's plenty demand can't get enough slates and er yes they say they've got er terrific overheads this and that, er well erm they can put them figures there they change the tune changes every day."
"they haven't got one and i'll er say this as i've said everything on the wireless or anything, whatever i've said i'll say to their face, and i can slot the perhaps they can't prove everything but you know it's there."
they can put figures down er you know writing things off erm whatsit twenty percent per year for a machine right in five years' time that machine is scrap.
but it's still worth thousands of quid so to them that is there're thousands erm er there's quite a lot of things they built up.
"and whether the wheel is turning too fast for them to cope with it somewhere along the line they've lost control any and there's still i'm told  young many a time a good shop steward and a good management should be a good team together, but erm unless they can work in harmony you know it's no good."
you seem erm puzzled the silence of the big group.
yes erm when i was talking when they erm they they went all silent erm  there was not talk about ffestiniog slate.
whether they're moving the money from ffestiniog slate into something else like nobody can prove it but that's my estimation.
they getting er they training ffestiniog slate now.
mean i'm putting i'm er if i was in their shoes that's exactly and i think i'm not wrong.
training ffestiniog slate men one of these days they say there is no more ffestiniog slate and that's it its gone bankrupt and er but i mean that can be easily arranged sort of thing.
erm right er tom  was going on his holidays our union bloke about a fortnight nor three weeks something like that after the strike situation.
oh they wanted tom  then cos er the deputy i think it was old  was it or something like that oh they didn't want to talk to him oh they wanted to talk to tom and all this and tom wasn't available.
but tom came back they didn't want to you know.
so they'd been playing cat and mouse game and er it hasn't paid off you know.
"as they say erm whether they were thinking, well we will starve them on the gate out and they'll have to come back, that's another situation but erm i never thought we'd have so much support from people and we can still erm i mean i'd rather be back at work but erm that is the situation."
"i mean  said the other day, why don't you pack up this stupid idea of picketing."
"i said, why you can just carry on normally?"
"no he said, we have given you my i said yes see we haven't if you adopt that attitude we getting nowhere."
"i said, i don't want to hassle you but i'm going to give you as much as i can."
"and i said, you flat out there avoiding it so he said erm you've accuse us of erm taking slates out at night."
"i said, yes i stop me and  we stopped the waggon half past two in the morning the  a load going to erm holland or somewhere."
"oh he said, we've always sent them out at night."
"i said, oh no you haven't."
i said that is a he didn't deny it er and he said that driver won't come back again because he was hoodwinked into coming up.
it was the same waggon yes but it was different driver and er not sure whether they taken the slates themselves there now.
so really whatever little slates he's doing it's er costing him hard labour and er just because we can't er resolve the situation.
"and erm i say he wasn't er he wouldn't go to acas, will  and our glyn from erm  they went to acas, and they said oh everything's fine in our quarry but they were side stepping the main issue that we'd been sacked and there's the  boys are out and majority of ."
"there are those that have gone back and erm er it was them shutting their eyes to what the the main the crux of the matter and saying, no no everything's fine in the garden that's just er trying to kid us but er i don't think it will work."
mind you erm there's one or two of the lads that are driving the waggons there.
well there's one lad he driving the waggon er he works for another branch of them it just  the haulage whatsit.
"well he's like the pig in the middle again, er they've told him well unless you drive the waggon backwards and forwards through the gates, well you're no good to us down the road."
well if he came out on strike with us erm and we won if we won everything we he'd gain nothing in the end cos he's in another section.
so i mean people can't say that we're just like er blind bats batting we'll you'll lose the situation these lads are in.
er we'd like to see them out with us to give the company as much harassment.
erm right there's one of the partners there er he's er i don't know what he's doing he's doing somersaults i think backwards to help the situation but it doesn't.
well there's another lad he's been ill in health he's worked more now than he ever has cos he used to work a few days and lose a few days and he wasn't.
well perhaps they've given him er a green carrot.
you know you can't blame them i know it's going against our policies and everything but we erm we're not blind to the situation.
er we are er vexed at the management er they are sitting down to slits er splay tt split slates.
erm  he's had three crates the other day back cash rejects shows you that poor slates are going out.
well they maintain oh no anybody can split them.
yes anybody but then there is er a quality and a grade and everything to them.
"because they are one of the worst ones if they bought er a land rover or any any british make, oh oh look at the shoddy british, they're crying they're up in arms and they're doing exactly the same thing now."
right they've er they've been preaching against spanish slates.
well i've seen spanish slates in the quarry.
"so when i tackled mr  about it he said, oh we must maintain our customers."
so really they're not er playing the game.
and i mean i'm not saying this now to advertise our cause or anything but i think it should be noted down.
"right all the machines they've got erm are either german or italian, say we got  dump trucks erm we."
dump trucks there they know they're over five years old and they're still working.
er they say they're not worked hard well i think they have they've moved er moved a few thousand tons from there and erm.
"er they have about erm well i'm not sure, about twenty eight or thirty thousand gallons of diesel stocked up there, and in them buying it in bulk like that they get it at a cheaper rate."
"they would fill the tanker from there and we go round the quarry filling the front machines, but erm they say at five or six thousand gallons has been emptied that er dump."
as they say it would have been all over the village  the smell and everything it is wrong.
well i have made a statement to the police and have put it in the police station in a sealed envelope.
i was about the last one with a tanker er before er strike i mean they've been there afterwards but er and er a certain tank was empty.
"well i marked that certain tank and i put it in in a sealed envelope to the police station and i said i don't know which tank they said whoever's emptied it has done, but i said, if it happens to be that tank then they are lying."
"if it's another tank i can't prove otherwise but i know one tank er the fourth tank you can't empty it, it's got be syphoned out it comes from the top and er if you went there and just opened the valve you can get a an ounce of diesel it."
so really you know it leaves them and erm they've got to prove it erm.
i'm not out to if they're going to claim on this diesel then that's them but i'm not going to have our lads or anybody else blamed for something which definitely does not exist and i shall tell  i erm i meet him to have a chat with him again that he's going along the wrong lines.
and i think er well i mean they haven't said i think the police had erm suspicious about the story.
you again you mentioned earlier on about erm members of your lodge members of going out erm and talking.
yes.
to other groups.
erm how did that that may be quite a sophisticated thing to to do in a way isn't it?
"yes erm how can i say, we were invited manchester university er to speak at dinner time, four of us went up and i was nominated as the speaker."
i made a bit of a speech and all that and er like a clever dick i went without me glasses .
so i had to make the speech best as i could and it went down i think.
erm then we had to call on the way back in deeside er in mold and there was a miner's support group there.
we called and saw them and we had quite a nice reception.
there was only about oh about two or three dozen there.
and er and because    we call him he spoke there and he spoke very well because  and erm that's it.
"people came to us after the meeting, we met this lady and er she was really interested in our cause."
she's erm she's a waitress in chester so it can shows you how much cross section we've got and erm she said her and her boyfriend was coming blaenau to be on the picket line and we were quite friendly with her.
"then she said, i've arranged now if you would like to go down and speak in er a meeting in oxford."
"we said, fair enough."
er two of us went down to oxford we pick her and her boyfriend up in shrewsbury and we went all down together and erm  excuse me.
"we went down there they'd arranged for us er place to sleep and everything, and we went to this meeting it was quite a big hall i think they were all like trade union delegates and that."
and erm we spoke to the chairman during the afternoon in his house and  was talking to him and spoke to him about erm an accident he'd had  in the quarry.
anyway erm the chap the first speaker was from silent night bedding and they're in dispute for a long time.
he spoke and he spoke quite well and that's it.
"then the next one spoke was er one of the yorkshire miners, one of these er that hasn't got a job to back to."
he spoke quite well.
and then it came  turn and er  was er speaking quite well when this girl behind us this wee well along side us was thumbs up on him all the time you know he was doing well and that.
"and erm and he did this sermon so the next bloke he came from kent somewhere er he was a miner or a miner's delegate and he could really speak you know, arms waving and all that and he was a real preacher."
but the thing was nobody was impressed with him he was too much of er he was too good a speaker you know.
you have a feeling er let's get it over with with him.
"so anyway, he erm had his say quite a long story and er the chairman turned round and he he couldn't say  the chairman er said call him  cos that's what we call him and he said er  he said erm would you like to come back to the rostrum again and he said erm you were explaining to me about an accident you had in the quarry in  quarry, erm some years back and he said, i'd like you to explain to these people."
"so  said to me  yes carry on you're doing fine you know and he went up and er well he didn't know how to start the poor fellow  doing smashing and he said, well erm imagine this hall, he said, this hall we're in now as a big cavern underground."
"and he said he was working with an old fellow which is getting on in age and he was quite absent minded  and he said, i was about thirty feet from the ground on a ledge er filling er a hole ready for shot for blasting and the old fellow was about twenty feet higher than him and then he was er whatsit another hole and then at the top of the chamber there's a little hole, he said, like a roof we call it which is a little passage that goes up into the next floor and then we used that as an escape route he didn't have to go far."
"well then er quite, so he said erm it was all quiet and i looked up into the darkness and i said  that the old fellow had gone and he litten his fuse  and there was me there i could see the sparks in the darkness and i was way twenty feet below him and he must have whatsit."
"so i said i had to make a quick decision either i was going to go up me chain past his whatsit and into the roof, or else go thirty feet down and run right across the chamber into whichever er level they could go to."
and i scrambled me chain and as i was doing that's the last he remembers.
either a spark had come down from the old fellow's hole up there or him with hobnail boots had trod on er black powder and set it off and his hole went out underneath his feet.
it was only a small one he said.
and the next thing he know he remembers he's hanging with a half feet around his  the chain had slipped 't was round his ankle and he was hanging in the dark twenty feet from the ground.
and the old fellow's holes went out but they went right over him never a scratch on him.
"and er he was there er two blokes had to get come get chains and get him it and all that and here wasn't a scratch on him but erm he was off for about five or six months you know he had ee ee this brain tests and everything, the shock had er he was quite bad for some time."
"well, the people were so impressed they, you could have heard a pin drop in that hall, and he really in our welsh way he put it over proper you know and erm the chairman made a quite a nice remark in the end he said, now he said we must remember these two fellows here, i said, they are welsh and they speak welsh as their first language they don't speak it for fancy they use it every day and he said i think they've done exceedingly well er to come down here and give us the because what happen i was sit in the front row and somebody asked me  a question and he said, perhaps er dafydd there can answer."
so i got up then and i spoke to the room you know and we were more or less helping out and i thought the chairman had done well when he said erm they don't speak er welsh for fancy or anything they use it as every day.
and he give us.
"well, we've had quite a lot of money from oxford from different people so you don't know."
"there's some people send us money and say, i've read in such and such a paper, erm somebody send it from chesterfield the  there their paper there, and they send us ten pounds or something and erm you know erm you never know how the fruits er."
"somebody want us to go to newark, i think that is by nottingham isn't it, to speak there."
and now there was a chap on the phone last night he want to go to  valley and i was trying to tell the bloke who who he between doing pickets and trying to keep count and er .
"oh he said, you don't have to send er professional speaker or anything just somebody to have a chat with ya."
that'll boost the situation up some.
got to see  later today to see what arrangements we can make.
you erm you said that er you felt that possibly after christmas that the things would go flat .
how how do you manage to keep people's spirits up the dynamism?
i don't know you know it's er  it er we do manage  and what breaks er people's spirit is i mean we we know we don't get the money we should be having.
"well if you've got a big bill or something hanging over your head, that will send you quite erm into the dumps."
we try and help them out mm best we can.
we haven't got erm money to just er do what you like.
"we had a party a party for the kids in aberystwyth on saturday, but all the students paid it never cost us a halfpenny."
and it was a kiddies party really.
yes they gave us a drink of beer and that erm and that was entirely them and erm.
"and i mean there are lots of things now er which er how can i say i never had much interest before erm never thought that they when you've seen the help in hand they've dished out erm , s d p,the erm oh the council of churches which you know  never there are all sorts of erm i tell you another people and erm i the gay and lesbian society you know, people take them er lightly but er it makes you sit up and and think now."
and we had a really nice letter and good donation from them you know.
so everybody that reaches out a helping hand.
naturally mrs thatcher doesn't reach out a helping hand cos this this is right in her er cricket pitch.
no without being erm we get them from medical sides  you name them they come and erm oh it's fantastic.
but i never thought i'd er be doing this type of job  t'other day er.
no as i say i haven't got much to lose or anything but i think it's a trade that is worth protecting and er you know it's not a trade er it's a living for the people innit?
and should be a decent living erm  yes but surely with all the demand there is today for slate and that.
you you've indicated that the work that you've been involved in has changed you in some respects it certainly made you more aware of of other other other people and the way they're prepared to help.
do you think that's had an effect on your your mates ?
yes erm i don't know if i mentioned you a question properly er right there were young lads in there they be young lads in that lodge  do this and they jump up and they make a decision quickly.
but you got to start putting all the works in motion  oh yes what is the end product or what is the outcome of this and that.
"and i've been a few years on the council now and when i first went on the council i was going to move mountains and make oh big taj mahals everywhere, but when you get on these things you have a rude awakening, it doesn't work out that way and it works out exactly the same in this erm."
you can have one quick move and if it's a false one well er you made a bad mistake and you've gone back about er whatsit and i think  's done exactly the same here he's sacked us and he's put himself in er in er queer corner like a game of draughts you know and he's trying all roads to come it.
"fair enough, well if i can help him in any way by talking to him, it's not a case of who wins and who loses, we all lose."
i'm quite prepared to do it.
"and er i've told tom and the union bloke who's said, yes if you can talk to anybody member of the family to bring anything any consolation, do it."
"so i'm not creeping back for my job but anything erm it's not that and erm but the lads in the lodge sometimes you've got to and er i've got a bit of er well a speery voice you know rough so  sometimes i get a little bit of control on them and erm also as i said about these chaps that are working, erm we're not blind, we know what's happening and we've got sympathy even with them."
"and we don't want, another thing, we don't want to do now is erm get man against man."
"you see if we can split this union in two, that's exactly what the management wants."
well we're playing right into their hands.
"though we're not in agreement to what's happened, we got to be very careful because you see what's happened to the coal er dispute."
and er if i can help it i've got to erm do me best to stop that happening.
is that is that level of of understanding er sort of part general within within the mine?
"no not you get different statements different erm i wouldn't like to repeat some of them right, but if them lads sat down and studied it erm same as i've said now and they say, well yes aye."
if we quarrel if we have a good punch up and all that between us and them that would suit the other side right down to the ground.
so we're losing.
so really we've got to erm give in right in our estimation they were wrong.
erm and i've said further on that erm some could have afford to stay out but that's they we're not all built the same and erm we must avoid that at all cost.
"and i suppose it's us like the erm the old stagers to we should know better and i think tom the union chap, he's he can see that and he wants to avoid it cos he's got to speak to the lot of them ?"
you've you've made it clear with him that you discriminate quite clearly between the people that go back to work because they've got children or they've got lot of and they've got to do a lot of financial obligations and those who who don't.
would you say that is true?
no there are some er lads gone back to work yes they got children they got mortgages we realize that.
there are some gone back to work they haven't got all that heavy obligations but there are lads on the line which have got very heavy complications and children and they have stuck it out you know.
"so it all depends how you different people different personalities and that and erm right though i don't agree with them what they've done, erm as i said, if i don't speak or if we don't whatsit we going to ruin the whole thing we're fighting for."
would you say that that the that the experience of the n u m has been a very important one for you in that respect ?
"oh yes very much so and we've been these er lots secretaries and presidents and all miners and that they've been coming up you know and er you had a chat with them and they put us don't let this happen, don't let that happen, and make sure that erm you know people don't suffer and er oh it's been quite a vast experience for us yeah."
and they still keep on sending not just one flash in the pan you know.
they still know that we need that help.
now erm  they've been quite good to us.
as i said i don't like to to pick people out because it sounds the others are not doing.
we've had people we had one chap an old mate of mine he give us fifty p well he's on the dole there.
you know er you felt whatsit.
but that's it the system isn't but  they send us a donation which they'd had for appearing on b b c or something.
now erm  i think it is  and he rang me up and asked me would the strike still be on in the middle of er february.
well i said i can't say i wish it was over tomorrow.
"but if it was over tomorrow i said it's still left our lads in quite er hole financially, and we shall still need that."
"the help won't stop like overnight, we must keep going."
i said in that case we will make you a concert in mid january and i think he said  are coming with them.
"now er  they were having a concert and  i think was the principal part and when he went to have his fee he said, oh no you can send it to the  blaenau ffestiniog."
so i think  writing to john  to thank him.
"i mean i don't like to pick people out there's quite erm er dr  from south wales he lives here, well he was born and bred here."
"we had a nickname for him, they call him."
erm  won't mind that.
he's been quite good to us and er  they sing on the street for us.
erm i could go through that book and erm it's never ending.
yeah.
well dafydd thank you very much.
okay.
right just.
"right, first thing,."
we'll make a list.
"i lost me prescription when he gave me, and we've been away."
"the, my eye i got some drops from the chemist cos my eye was bad."
and it feels there's grit all in it now.
yeah.
so you haven't actually had any eyecron.
"no i had, i had  of the chemist in chapel because it came."
yeah.
so bad.
yeah.
so you really need.
some eyecron don't you?
yeah.
i think i do with this.
you really need some eyecron.
yeah.
i wouldn't go to a doctor there this malignant thing so i just managed till we came back.
"yeah , well i."
"getting better but it's just this gritty thing in the back of my eye, i mean i."
yeah.
was.
just er look up for me.
it still looks rather boggy doesn't it?
mm.
it's terrible.
er  the other eye.
that one.
mm.
doesn't look too bad but that one.
just look straight at me.
"yeah i, the front of the eye looks quite,."
mm.
it just feels horrible.
yeah.
"it's nothing to do with hay fever is it, this, do you think?"
yeah.
"cos when i blow nose, this thing,pops."
it's queer.
"there's a drainage tube,."
i've always suffered with my sinuses.
there's a drainage tube that goes from.
yeah.
"this corner of the eye, to."
yeah.
the top of the nose.
which is.
mm.
"why, when you cry, your nose runs."
"okay, and."
mm.
mm.
"if that is , that keeps blocking,."
mm.
"when you blow your nose it will tend, it can go the."
mm.
other way .
yeah.
but are they okay with leaving it.
for another week will i?
it'll be okay with.
mm.
leaving it.
i hope.
well i hope the eyecron will actually get it to settle down.
"so, you said that was the first thing, or were, was it  that were both  it."
no that was it.
i wanted to be honest and say i'd.
yeah.
lost a prescription.
then we.
went away you see?
"and i thought, well i'll just pop in chemist and i was hoping it would clear it up, so i wouldn't."
yeah.
have to confess.
no don't.
but it's not.
still gritty?
yeah.
so we'll see what the eyecron does.
"if it still remains uncomfortable, then we, then we need to have a closer look and we may need to get the eye specialist involved if it's refused to settle down."
but you can still see clearly?
yeah.
yeah.
that's good yeah.
i  a lot of pain at the back of my eye though.
yeah.
while i were on.
"holiday, it was terrible."
"well it's bit brighter at the coast, and."
yeah.
"well we'll, we'll see what happens with the eyecron i think that'll turn it off, but  doesn't then we must have another look, very."
important.
i'm very  bye bye.
okay.
see you.
bye now.
pardon?
ooh.
"do have a seat mrs  anyway, what can i do for you today?"
well it's this damn cough and cold  get.
still coughing?
i've had it since just before christmas and it keeps going and coming.
mm.
are you coughing anything up with it?
"no i can't i, i heave with it but i can't get nowt up."
right.
"i made myself some medicine, some er honey, glycerine and apple cider vinegar."
mm.
it's an old remedy but i think.
but it still hasn't worked?
no.
no.
no.
let's have a look.
nothing's worked.
"now open wide for me, that's fine."
say ah.
ah.
stick your tongue right out.
. good.
"right let's have a quick listen, i think what we're going to need to do is to get a chest x- ray, your chest is fairly clear, i still suspect it's the hernia that's drying things up."
bit cold.
nice deep breaths.
clear at the front and your heart sounds fine too.
"deep breaths again, that's fine."
"oh  breathing hard, i go dizzy."
oh i'm sorry.
. breathe more gently then if you wish.
"that's fine, your chest actually."
sounds absolutely clear.
"so what can it, what can it be cos it's worrying."
don't know.
me.
"something, somewhere is irritating either the lungs or the airway or the back of the throat."
well in fact the back of the throat looks fine.
yeah.
"the lungs sound clear, so it's probably the airway."
"and if you get a hernia, hiatus hernia, with acid."
yeah well i got that's what i have got one.
that's right.
"and you have acid coming up the gullet,."
yeah.
it can irritate the airway too and you can cough hiatus hernias.
no the important.
"there's no way i can, i don't."
yeah.
hiatus hernias.
don't.
er.
they ever go?
well.
themself or anything?
"they don't go by themselves, the problems they cause can go, but that's different."
"what we need to do to start off with is to look at your chest in greater detail, get a chest x-ray."
"if that's clear we then need to go back and attack the hiatus hernia with more erm, but we'd better get your chest sorted out first."
should have gone in hospital last monday to have me hand done.
yeah.
and i'm going on holiday on saturday.
right.
"so er, er it were daft weren't it?"
going and having it done and then going on holiday.
to keep going and everything.
that's alright.
"now if i give you this you can actually go along at your own convenience,."
yeah.
"so you can go before you go on holiday,."
yeah.
or in fact you can go afterwards.
"if, you know where the victoria hospital is?"
yes.
now called mansfield community?
"yes, yes,."
"if you if you nip down there you can go any day monday to friday, you can go any time between nine and four thirty, you've just got to remember to take your lunch."
tomorrow because i'm at me mam's tomorrow at.
yeah.
mansfield and i can go when i come back from me mam's about three o'clock.
perfect.
and i get the results for when i come back then.
won't i?
yeah.
that's right.
"okay, so let me just write that on the back, monday to friday and that's nine to four thirty."
if you go there it's easier to get to.
yeah.
okay.
"that's the next step we we may need to treat your tummy with something else after that but i think that's rather going to depend on what the chest x-ray shows, and how you feel."
"you may find after coming back from holiday there's nothing wrong with you, so er."
yeah but i mean i've had it since your fortnight before christmas on and off.
"yeah, i know, yeah."
it's driving me blooming mad.
mhm.
"it's driving derek mad , and i've."
"got right down from about, what?"
twelve fifteen cigarettes to four.
"yeah,you're doing well."
"so, and i'm trying to stop altogether but."
yeah.
i can't do it all in one.
no.
go.
you're.
and.
"doing the right things though, so."
"you know it's not having this, this."
you know here?
mhm.
"and even here, i've got it."
"i, i, do you know i wish, i just wish that i could explain how i feel, but i can't."
mm.
i'm trying to tell you how i feel in myself.
all my bones feel they're seizing up.
yeah.
that's how i feel.
i hurt i really hurt.
mm.
"here all up here, here in my arms i mean i had seven week physiotherapy on this arm, it's."
mm.
no better now than.
no.
what it were when i started going.
mm.
"it's all, it dead, it's."
mm.
it hurts.
"i wake up like it, i go to bed like it, i've got it all the time that i'm living with a bloody nightmare, all the time."
and i don't think it's from that hand.
mm.
"i don't, don't for a minute think it's from that hand, because you know the tingling, you're are you supposed to get tingling all time?"
"you can do, yes."
well i don't.
you can do.
i don't.
not necessarily.
it's these bones what hurt here.
mm.
that's the main problem there.
"when i'm, i'm picking  doing owt it hurt, really hurt."
mm.
it's like i've  in mangle.
"and this is like two day  where i just aching, burning."
you know i don't know what to do with myself sometimes.
"i can't sit and watch television, i can't knit."
i sit and read and i'm tightening up like this and i  like that to.
mm.
"i'm always doing that,think i'm bloody daft when i do it, but it, it releases tension."
mm.
"i don't know what it is, but it oh it's carrying me down, i know that much and i have it for years and years."
"well there are one or two other things we can do to try and make you feel better er the, the hands aren't the principle cause er  i think we'll see what happens, work your chest the way first though."
yeah.
"i'm certainly not going to er to say let's give you a trial of this or a trial of that, until we know what's happened with your chest, so."
"yeah, well i've to tell you honest truth, i've been on i've been down that road."
i've.
mm.
"been down that road,."
if you've got me on the records it'll show you.
"yes, we're short of."
"cos i er i've just asked, they haven't found them yet."
"no, we don't know where they've gone."
"cos i mean it tells you on there, i can't remember, it tells you on there every tablet i've had, all for this."
to.
yeah.
no avail.
yeah.
"they go here, they go here and they make me dizzy."
mm.
"they make me light-headed, they make me feel sick, they go to my stomach,."
mm.
i'm bilious and they don't do anything for this.
no.
what i want.
to happen.
"we, we need to watch what we give you your."
yeah.
hiatus hernia.
yeah.
anyway.
let's have you having a chest x-ray and have a holiday.
yeah.
and then we'll have another look.
"well,."
when we come back.
but your chest.
i've had an holiday.
that's right.
"but your chest is, is sounding clear and i expect it's management of the hernia that's going to."
"ooh, can i have a prescription for them tablets?"
the sametadine is.
"yeah, i didn't actually take any."
the ones i gave you last yeah.
"yeah, yeah."
"yeah, yeah."
i'm nearly them.
"in fact i, i don't think i am."
sometimes er do i have to take them all the time?
i'm not sure about that.
"if i if i don't feel this hernia, if i ain't got any indigestion, i don't take them."
"i would for the moment, yeah, i would for the moment."
"yeah, just, just keep taking them, one in the morning and one at night?"
"yes, yes."
alright then.
"and then we'll have a chat about that, as i said,."
yeah.
when you're back from holiday.
"now fatty food, alcohol, large meals, fizzy drinks."
yeah.
will all tend to upset your tummy.
yeah.
so be cautious.
but.
yeah.
you are allowed to drink and you are allowed to splash out and you are.
oh yeah.
allowed to go and have sausage and chips at a caff.
yeah.
you know.
"just be, just be."
but drink in moderation.
"careful, yeah,."
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
"yeah,."
right?
"well i know i can't eat oranges, and i can't."
no.
eat orange juice.
no.
you'll find your own things.
"yeah that's it, yeah."
"if i, and salad cream i can't i can't even put salad cream on a salad."
oh dear.
because that upsets me and all.
shame i like.
i like a bit of salad cream.
"i know, yeah."
i've tried mayonnaise and i've tried.
come in.
come in.
come in.
mix up there.
aye.

"would you like to start off by telling us when you joined county council, in which department?"
"mm, it was the eleventh of october nineteen thirty nine."
mm.
"it was a michaelmas day or the old erm quarter day for paying rents and erm it was generally known in those days as muck spreading because erm it was    usual time for erm, the farm workers to get ready for the winter ploughing."
"anyway, if i could just erm describe how i managed to get there in the first place, which was all a matter of luck i suppose as much as anything  erm i  went to the east anglian schools for erm blind and deaf children at gorleston on sea from nineteen twenty eight to nineteen thirty six, erm, in those days erm education for the  er disabled er continued until sixteen."
"they always assumed that er, the disabled were two years behind the normal child er."
mm.
we had to spend  a couple of years erm longer at school.
"erm, i never had any idea what i might do when i left school, in fact erm, basket making and er one or two manual skills of that sort erm, there wasn't much available."
"but erm, it was suggested  about a year or so before i left, that i might take what was called the gardeners scholarship to erm the royal  college for the blind, which in those days was at erm upper norwood s e nineteen and erm so erm i had no objections, i didn't,i didn't  see any future in it anyway, but erm i took this erm scholarship examination, went the r n c to  work erm some papers and to be interviewed and erm, much to my surprise they erm offered me one of these scholarships which was worth forty pounds a year for three years in the commercial department of the college which was an innovation really as  erm primarily a college of music for erm blind students and erm  so off i went to the r n c of sixteen and erm did my three year course and got erm some r s a certificates and  erm was reasonably successful i suppose i, perhaps  i wasn't  as diligent as i should have been."
"i was much more interested in football and cricket really, but erm, anyway, i left in the july of nineteen thirty nine when things were getting  erm dubious in the international sphere and erm."
mm.
"still had no prospects of employment and i don't think er, er my parents had any erm particular ideas and my father who worked for erm roads and bridges department was speaking to the chief clerk at that time, that was, er, his name was  in fact and erm he was a very sympathetic character and er he said he'd have a word with erm  with somebody in the county council and erm see if they could find me employment as a typist and erm using the argument that the education department had that time at the r n c erm paid the balance of the fees for my course, erm i could just mention to you that the scholarship was worth forty pounds a year fee."
full fees were a hundred pounds a year and erm the education department had assessed my father's contribution towards the fees at six shillings a week which was about fifteen pounds a year.
they were paying something like forty five pounds a year for my training.
"well erm  erm  had a word with erm  who was about oh fourth in line in the erm education hierarchy in those days and erm   then spoke to  who was the chief education officer and er, i think they were erm, bit apprehensive about employing a blind typist because erm it was something that they had never had any experience of  but in the end they thought it was worth a try and er especially after supporting me at the college and erm also perhaps they had in mind that  many of the erm employees would be leaving if war broke out and erm, in fact by that time war had probably started."
mm.
"but anyway, erm, it came as a bit of a shock to me when  who was at that time the horticultural adviser or horticultural organiser as they used to call him, turned up at home at debenham where we lived at the time and er said he'd come to collect my typewriter  we had no notice of this anyway  was erm a jolly old soul and erm he went off with my typewriter and erm shorthand machine and the next day my father brought me into ipswich and erm, well i saw  and did a bit of typing and erm, that's how it all started."
you were the first blind person to be employed in the county council?
"in the county council, yes."
"mm, well there have been subsequent erm employees but."
mm.
"i felt that it was a bit of a responsibility to erm, to justify the  employment  of."
yes.
erm a blind person.
"i also remember, incidentally, the first letter that i had to erm type, a young chap who was erm shortly called up for service in the army came in and erm dictated a little letter to me to see how erm, how i got on and erm it was a letter to parents in halesworth  whose daughter had just been er transferred to a grammar school and erm in those days the, if the distance was three miles  the education committee er provided a cycle and cape and leggings and erm the object of the letter was to find out the child's inside leg measurement."
"well  yes, yes  i wondered whether i'd got it right you know, it sounded just a silly thing to ask and erm and i erm had to consider that  probably asked whether i had erm made a mistake in my shorthand  before, before  i actually typed it but erm, anyway they seemed erm reasonably satisfied and everybody was very kindly and erm considerate and."
mm.
and so i stayed there but erm travelling from debenham wasn't very easy that were.
how did you travel?
"by, by bus mhm."
"and erm but erm getting to and from the bus was a bit of a problem, unfortunately i've never had erm been one of these people who have got the nerve to erm go about a great deal by themselves and erm being up in london you know, immediately before the war i had erm, it wasn't very easy getting about so erm and erm i wasn't very."
confident really.
mm.
"but anyway, erm people used to be very helpful and erm."
mm mm.
so i managed for a few weeks and then i went to lodge with my sister at trimley.
mm.
and from there the bus service was erm much better.
"they had two or three different bus services and erm, the bus went past county hall it was quite,."
mm.
"quite easy, well it was comparatively easy,only trouble was that erm at night erm one had to go right down from county hall to barrett corner to get on the bus because they were so full by the time they got to county hall and erm so i used to walk down there with erm a chap from the education department, who was in the works and stores, a chap  and erm, he was quite helpful."
"mm, you never had a guide dog?"
"oh no, no."
"in fact there were very few guide dogs at that time and erm i've never felt that erm it's, i mean maybe  just my  erm silliness really but i, i never wanted a dog lying about all day because once at the office i stayed put until it was time to go home and i could have taken the dog i suppose during the lunch hour but i preferred that time to erm to reading."
mm.
and just relaxing and erm in any case as i say er guide dogs were few and far between at that time.
mm mm.
"and i've never wanted one since because er luckily i've got erm my wife who, we get about together."
mm.
"what, can you remember what your salary was when you ?"
yes it's erm  it was seventy five pounds a year at age nineteen.
mm.
"and erm i actually received twenty seven and twopence a week, to start with it was paid weekly but subsequently erm we went the monthly erm payments and er but that's what i had and er  i used to pay my sister fifteen shillings a week for, for lodgings."
mm.
but erm interestingly enough my salary until after the war was charged to erm civil defence.
"i think it was erm a bit of a ploy that erm i was extra to establishment really and i was only temporary, on the temporary staff until erm well a year or so after the war when all these things were sorted out and erm i was on the permanent."
how many hours a week did you work?
erm  well.
i think it was about forty four.
mm.
"but erm as a sort of public to the er, er a gesture to the public erm but one stage during the war when things were getting grim on the war front, it was decided that erm, we should work extra hours as erm,to show that we were pulling our weight   , so we used to, starting at nine o'clock until erm half past five, and working on saturdays of course, erm, we had to start at half past eight and finish at six and it was a bit of a fiasco really because nobody erm, you know, well the end of the half past five you were pretty well tired out so erm the rest of the time."
mm.
"you were really kicking your heels and erm quite which in the winter time the er conditions were pretty grim because they had the erm anti-splinter netting over the windows and erm big blinds which had to be drawn it was dusk because er, you weren't allowed to show a light and erm if that was  it became really thick."
mm.
"mm, i don't think the cleaners were all that erm good at their job, i mean they, they were, er perhaps that's unfair to them to say that because erm the collection of dust was erm  pretty dreadful."
mm.
"with all the books and files around and er, it became, anybody with any chest troubles erm."
mm.
found it very difficult cos erm atmosphere as i say was erm really dreadful.
mm.
it got very hot and erm stuffy and unpleasant.
mm.
"so erm, and that went on for, i suppose till the end of the war when er, when we had a reduction in hours again, we went back to the normal nine till half past five."
mm.
"mm, we did have to, oddly enough there was always a tradition when i started er  of working on tuesdays erm an extra quarter of an hour because that was committee day."
"and erm  i don't know what the idea really was, i think it was possibly erm, that people concerned with the committee meetings could erm sort themselves out and."
mm.
for more time to.
this was just presumably education committee?
"yes, it was just the education department."
"yes, mm."
as far as i can remember.
mm mm.
mm do you remember anything about the a r p during the war.
"oh, yes, yes , its erm, erm county hall was the county control centre for erm air raid precautions."
mm.
"erm,before i go that can i just erm tell you what erm, where we worked?"
"yes, certainly, sorry."
"erm, the archway from st helens is still there isn't it?"
"mm, yes."
now just on the left as you go under the archway there was a small door.
mm.
i don't know whether it's still there but.
yes.
erm you went into the small door and then turned right.
mm.
"there was erm, men's cloakroom on the left hand side and then our enquiry office was immediately on the right hand side."
"you went farther along, past erm  's room."
"being the chief clerk and then turned left and down quite a long corridor, which in those days was erm shorned up with four by four timber posts because er, presumably they thought if the county hall got a direct hit the ceiling might come down."
"but er they were a bit of a nuisance because once, i must admit i erm, i collided with them which rather made me aware of their presence but anyway erm, then just beyond  i am sorry, on the erm right hand side, a little way down this corridor, were the stairs the next floor which was in those days public health."
mm.
"and right those were stairs down to the basement but they've still got the basement, mm mm."
"yes, yes that's right second floor is education now."
is it?
yes.
oh yes because erm.
i know it because i finished up  erm then just beyond the erm the stairs down to the basement was arthur  's room.
mm.
and then.
got the general office now.
"mm mm, and then the next erm one down on the left was where i worked with erm a chap named tom ."
"erm his, he passed away some years ago."
"erm,interestingly enough erm cyril  was very friendly with er tom's son kenneth who was erm planning officer in some area now sussex."
"mm, mm."
"i think but continuing down the corridor erm which was all the education department, you came to the typists' room right at the bottom of the corridor on the left."
mm.
and then erm turning right you went past the ladies' cloakroom and before you got to the door out into erm grimwich street.
mm.
"there was a large room which was the control room and er in there they had erm four, three or four erm telephones which were manned constantly for twenty four hours."
mm.
and they took messages from the erm various a r p points throughout the county.
we're talking about east suffolk.
yes.
"not erm the whole of suffolk and erm the county hall staff as a whole was divided into six shifts, erm and each shift was on duty for twenty four hours a day, for twenty four hours on."
mm.
"and erm erm the shift that was on say sunday, would erm erm be on again on the saturday and so it erm, you know you got a different day."
mm.
"each week and erm, the shift which was on duty say on sunday would have monday off, they were, they could erm go home on monday."
mm.
"and erm  the six shifts had erm controller and generally speaking these were heads of department, the erm, the mr  who was chief education officer at that time."
"incidentally, he wasn't known as chief education officer, he was secretary for education, he only became chief education officer after the war but erm he was the controller of shift e and most of the education staff were on shift e."
"it so happened that erm tom  who i was working with, see he was on shift er shift f and er  there was always a bit of rivalry  between the various shifts as er, erm, you know, who did the better job and all this sort of thing."
"they were always erm, making caustic comments about the entries in the, in the log book which the telephonists had to keep, erm, of the messages that came through."
mm.
"but erm  they erm, they had their meals in the canteen which was one of the committee rooms adapted for that purpose  and erm, i think erm, the younger people used to quite enjoy it really i mean they used."
what did you think of it?
"well i was never on it  i was exempt and erm the younger people were, they had the opportunity of not erm being on the shifts."
"oh i see, it wasn't compulsory then?"
"it wasn't compulsory er erm the age of about eighteen i think,."
mm.
"i think erm, you know there were one or two sort of erm clandestine meetings and that sort of thing."
yes .
as you could imagine  because erm they had all the whole building to erm to roam about in.
yes.
"and er, i think the younger people quite enjoyed it but the older ones, , found it bit of a bind, er particularly after erm the sort of patriotic fervour."
mm.
"wore off , i mean there was erm, everybody was feeling very patriotic at the beginning of the war but after four or five years the erm novelty wore off."
mm.
and erm.
was there any financial incentive for.
"not no, no, no, no."
"but erm  as far as financial incentive goes, erm  it was about a year or so after erm i started there i think when er they introduced it, the erm war bonus, which was a supplement to normal salaries."
mm.
"and erm this was erm, this created a bit of controversy because erm temporary staff, the reading of the minute, didn't er, weren't entitled to war bonus because erm, they'd been appointed at a certain salary and er that was that and er, but in the  end we  managed to get our war bonus so we were on equal pegging with the, with the other staff."
mm.
but erm there were one or two little hiccups of that sort where erm temporary staff were erm regarded as a bit er  second rate citizens.
mm.
"and erm, with all the erm younger men and some of the girls er, volunteered for the services."
mm.
"er we had quite a number of married women coming in to er, to work as part of their war effort and erm, there was quite, there was quite erm  quick turnover of staff at that time."
mm.
"and erm  to be fair to them, i don't think that erm some of them were particularly interested in,in their work  and er."
mm.
"the war effort was really erm a way of getting erm home because the women were erm, found themselves left on their own."
mm.
cos the men had gone to the services.
mm.
"but erm  yes that was the erm, that was the a r p erm."
mm.
story.
yes.
"coming on now to your working relationship with west suffolk, i mean did you have much contact with, with staff in west suffolk or?"
"very, very little really, erm we had contact with other authorities , in the course, in erm er particularly evacuation, erm  evacuation took up erm quite a lot of staff and, and time at that er particularly initially because erm suffolk was in a peculiar position or the east suffolk was, erm at the beginning of the war erm east suffolk was an evacuation, er was erm a reception area."
mm.
"and erm there were all sorts of funny stories and erm some of them not quite so funny about erm the way that the children and erm mothers from dagenham came by sea and landed at, at felixstowe."
"yes, i've heard about that, yes."
"and erm it was really remarkable because er, i mean presumably the germans were told about it and erm kept  u-boats and    and the  from shipping out the er."
mm.
"out the area, but to bring them from, by sea from dagenham to erm felixstowe is."
"by, by rail."
yes.
mm.
"and erm, then when they reached felixstowe, everything was chaotic because they had to sleep on the floor in the schools down there."
mm.
"and then they were bussed to acton crossroads where erm a rather bemused erm billeting, chief billeting officer then had to decide where the buses had got to go to."
"and so  you know looking back on it, was all rather funny but erm, it wasn't at the time particularly for the children and erm mothers."
did evacuation just take place over two or three days or?
"yes, mm mm,."
mm.
"but erm it had sorted itself out after, well more or less after a week or two a lot of the evacuees didn't stay very long, they went back home because erm  i know mother had a, a little boy from erm guildford when we lived at debenham and er he went back after a while, the mother used to come down and visit him , they were very, came from very poor circumstances and the."
mm.
mother used to spend most of her time in the local when she did come and er.
mm.
"in the end she took the children home with her, erm it was so different from what they'd been used to in those erm."
mm.
"east, well in the east end particularly, guildford was not much better."
mm.
but erm  erm  anyway  the erm children were absorbed into the schools of some sort.
mm.
"but erm then became, we got round to the erm question of getting the children into similar schools to the ones that they'd been in and erm i came into this, in fact i came into all sorts of things erm well by accident then i suppose anyway  not for any other reason  but erm mr  erm who was the secretary for education, he had a personal assistant a chap named erm  erm he was a very likeable chap erm and er a rather bit of an eccentric really because erm he'd been erm, he'd trained as a doctor and erm he'd left the course before completing it."
"then he went erm into the navy for a short time and for some unknown reason he managed to get the navy and came as mr  's personal assistant and erm one of his jobs was to erm get these children sorted out and i used to write no end of letters for him to erm places like erm ilford and wanstead and mainly the northern suburbs of london erm about certain children who had been attending central schools which were something, which were something that erm east suffolk couldn't offer and erm trying to decide whether they ought to go to grammar school or one of the area schools as they then were."
mm.
in suffolk and erm most complicated situations we got into.
mm.
the erm billeting actually was dealt with by a section connected with the er county accountants department.
mm.
"which subsequently became the treasurers  and erm  they used to erm collect the contributions from, from parents and there again i got involved because they were short of typists at one time."
mm.
and erm we had to write to parents and er collect contributions which were overdue.
mm.
"how large were the, were the classes with these influx of all these,did it boost up the numbers in the?"
"yes, somehow they used to accommodate them but."
mm.
"you see it wasn't very long after that that  they were deciding somewhere in er erm, i think whitehall that erm suffolk should become an evacuation area."
mm.
"at that point erm, we ceased to receive evacuees and felixstowe went to redditch, felixstowe grammar school."
"i am talking about grammar schools actually because erm the work that i was concerned with was in the secondary education which erm translated really means meant grammar school education, the schools that erm i had most contact with were the grammar schools."
felixstowe went to redditch and worcestershire.
"erm, oddly enough leiston grammar went to sudbury."
"erm lowestoft, which was the only other one which evacuated in total, they went as a school a, you know, the individual children."
erm lowestoft went to worksop in erm nottinghamshire.
"mm, how how were the children transported?"
just.
oh they went erm.
by train?
"they went by train, yes."
mm.
"and erm they went as a unit, staff most of the staff went."
mm.
"with them and one or two remained behind but er, yes it was interesting how erm  i always found it rather funny that er you had to go to leiston to sudbury to  evacuated to school."
"and erm  if i could just mention that we had eight grammar schools, there was erm, in alphabetical order they were beccles, er beccles sir john the man, er bungay grammar which had er small boarding house."
"erm, felixstowe,oh sorry i missed out hy grammar school which was the really famous one."
mm.
"mm,felixstowe grammar school,famlyn and mills grammar school, leiston and lowestoft and stowmarket."
mm.
"lowestoft was the biggest, erm and lowestoft had a peculiar sort of administrative set up because they were what was described as erm a divisional executive and erm they had powers over their own committees  higher education which in modern parlance is further education."
"we used to call it higher education, and erm so we had to deal with the, the lowestoft grammar school in the same way as we did with the other schools and also with the erm technical institute which was at lowestoft, that was the only erm purpose-built erm centre for further education in the, in the county at that time."
mm.
"ipswich was a separate power, we had nothing to do with ipswich."
mm.
the erm lowestoft technical institute was actually in clapham road and that got a direct hit.
mm.
"er luckily, as far as i know, nobody was erm, nobody was erm nobody was killed."
there may have been one or two injured.
mm.
"but the principal of the technical institute at lowestoft was quite a character, a mrs, a miss g c  and i remember it was the day after the erm, the bombing and the building was pretty well devastated and er miss  rung up and said, she'd got an idea she  said  erm how about hiring a bus, a double-decker bus, i could have my classes in the bus and erm."
it it could er be driven around when there are air raids to get danger.
"but she was a marvellous person, erm."
mm.
"erm it may be that erm my generation, but you don't get the same sort of personalities  nowadays  as you did in those days, erm mr  he was, he was a most benign sort of erm fellow of what one would describe as a real gentleman mm, mind you he used to have his paddies at times but."
mm.
"he was erm a very fine man really, i suppose,."
mm.
"i remember erm one morning he came in in a bit of erm  he was obviously very annoyed about something and er, when he was in those sort of moods he used to expect erm all sort of reports to be presented and er he wanted er statistics which nobody else had ever thought of and erm arthur  who as i have hinted before was erm really my sort of  guardian angel  he, he er did a great deal for me."
"he was erm the chap, sort of chap who was erm, who was able to calm things down, he er."
mm.
"he had a way with him and he was, got on very well with mr  and er he told us afterwards that erm the whole trouble was that the children's baths had leaked that  morning."
oh dear .
"and it  turned mr  into a bit of a tizzy, but erm."
mm.
"i don't suppose you'd er get that sort of relationship nowadays and it was during the war when people er the fact that erm there was a war on erm was a levelling down or up or a levelling of, of people's situations they,."
mm.
"they were all in it together and er, there was perhaps not quite so much erm side."
mm.
as erm as they would otherwise be.
so there was more sort of community spirit?
.
yes that sort of thing yes.
"yes i well remember er i when i was staying down at trimley there was erm a lady there who worked in the billeting department, who who herself was evacuated from london and er, i used to catch the same bus with her but she never would speak to me, erm  and erm  one morning er she lived down at curton and one morning they had some erm er german planes over curton and they were doing some machine gunning and that sort of thing and erm  and we met at the bus  stop and she was full of it and erm that broke the ice it was."
"it was really amazing,."
mm.
"how erm,just because there'd been this, this scaring incident, it made her loosen her tongue and er."
mm.
"because if i might say so disabled people were treated oddly in those days, they are not er, erm people i think were er diffident about making contact with them and erm, a lot of people wouldn't erm, you know, give you a hand if you were."
oh really?
crossing a road.
and that sort of thing.
"oh really, that's a sort of discrimination."
"it's, it's much better now er erm, you know people have become more  understanding ."
mm.
"mm, must have been very difficult then to get around sometimes then."
"oh well it was, yes, and erm you know if people are friendly and er talk to you and, you know you don't want help, if they offer it's always appreciated."
mm.
erm.
would you like to say a little bit more about the actual work of your department?
"yes, erm arthur  as i have mentioned earlier was erm the fourth in command and erm if i can just go down the erm the pecking order, mm, leslie  was the chief education officer."
in those days called the secretary.
"he had a personal assistant who er, well didn't come into the reckoning really erm because he merely erm was filled in when mr  couldn't er attend various functions."
"then the, the assistant secretary for education was erm a very interesting chap erm he was a mr a o d  and erm he was, he had erm an elementary school background, he hadn't a degree or any qualification but he'd been in  so long that er he'd worked his way erm,erm to assistant secretary for education and he was a jolly chap and erm and he produced a, a dictionary of erm, of the suffolk dialect which has became quite erm, quite a classic work really."
mm mm.
"and then erm next in order was erm alfred  who was the chief clerk and then there were a number on level pegging, there was erm cyril  works and stores, arthur  who was erm, as i've said was my  erm the  guardian and erm in the finance section was charlie  and erm then there was the typing pool."
"erm, when i first started erm i think the typists felt that erm as an ordinary typist i ought to er be in the typing pool but i'm glad i didn't  because i don't think i would have felt very happy amongst er."
other women?
"yes, so many ladies i i don't know how many there were about erm five or six i think."
mm.
"so i've shared a room with erm this chap tom  who was er  he had been in the first world war and er though he seemed old to me at the time, i suppose he was probably in his thirties and erm  he joined the home guard and erm lived, because he was bombed out where he lived in  he moved out to coptock had accommodation out there and er he was in the unit at coptock and so that used to take up quite a bit of his time and other erm members of staff were, also had fire watching and erm various civil defence activities, quite the work on the a r p shifts."
mm.
"arthur  erm he was exempt from erm er these sort of civil defence activities, i think  bit of  in the road where he lived."
yeah  that is.
mm.
but erm he'd always had a temperamental heart and erm at times he wasn't well.
mm.
mm it's interesting to think that he's now in his eighties and er.
he's survived all the er heart condition that he ever did have.
mm.
"and in fact er latterly he was much erm, much fitter than he was when i first knew him."
mm.
"but he was a very very kindly man and er he introduced erm me to a lot of things which i wouldn't otherwise have erm  been able to do, or i wouldn't have had the erm, been invited to do."
mm.
"and the work of our little section erm, which consisted of tom, tom , myself, arthur  and a young girl erm of about fifteen, sixteen."
erm  was the erm running of these eight grammar schools  erm evening institutes  erm tom  was er sort of commander in chief of evening institutes.
mm.
"erm, then there were all sorts of odds and ends which i think very largely were erm the result of mr  wanting to erm  build up a name for his suffolk  doing rather more than perhaps some other authorities."
mm.
and er particularly in the field of agriculture  erm  we had erm an agricultural organiser  and erm he ran experimental plots in erm places like tunstall and wickham market.
we also had an agricultural horticultural organiser erm with experimental plots and he went round to schools and er.
mm.
looked after erm the work done in school gardens.
mm.
"and erm  one of er, of the various committees that erm arthur  was was an agricultural sub committee which in turn had a sub committee called the poultry sub committee."
now erm for  some reason  or other we were responsible for the accredited poultry breeding station scheme which was erm initiated by the department of education or the ministry of education as it was then at that stage.
"erm, sorry of agriculture not education."
mm.
and erm these were poultry breeders erm scattered all over the er county who  yes the erm accredited poultry breeding station scheme was erm initiated by the ministry of agriculture  and erm there were a number of farms scattered all over the county  erm where they were open to inspection and erm we had erm had a mrs  who went round and inspected the flocks and erm they had to reapply each year to erm sustain their accreditation.
mm.
and erm you'd be surprised really how much er  correspondence  and er.
erm arguing and er they was going on about this because if mrs  went to a farm and then said that she saw some hens there that didn't look particularly fit erm and said they'd got to be culled and if the farmer thought otherwise then we got into all sorts of tangles because we knew nothing about poultry.
mrs er  presumably did.
mm.
"and erm there was no final erm sort of er judgment to be had so erm then we had to call meetings of this little sub committee who finally made up their minds and i remember typing reports, quite long reports, about erm rhode island reds er crossed with light sussex and light sussex crossed with er brown  and erm i, i knew precious little about poultry at that time."
don't know very much now  but er it er became most monotonous and i used to  and i used to like.
meetings with the poultry sub committee which then reported to the agriculture sub committee.
mm.
"and that in turn reported to erm, to the full education committee."
another sideline of this erm little secondary education section that erm arthur  was was the library and erm the library sub committee he erm had to look out for much to the annoyance of erm bill  who was the librarian at the time.
mm.
because erm bill thought that er really the library was his pigeon loft er not arthur  's.
mm.
erm erm  there were all sorts of erm little by- products from the agriculture and library and that sort of thing that er we had to erm deal with.
who actually was responsible for buying the books in the library?
"oh, the librarian was."
"librarian, mm."
"but he had to report, , to the library sub committee."
mm.
and arthur  was erm sort of clerk to the library sub committee.
yes.
but erm mr  took felt i think about er.
having to go through another person.
mm.
"but erm he was alright, very friendly really."
mm.
"and erm in fact, we were looking erm  my wife found a copy of the fiftieth anniversary erm of the county council the other day."
we were looking through that and erm mr  was the first er county librarian in east suffolk.
mm.
"and we knew him quite well because er before we moved, my parents moved to debenham, we've lived at trimley and he lived erm well next door but one to us and er so we knew mr  quite well."
mm.
"erm   the work that i became, as it happened, mostly concerned with was the erm granting of major scholarships as they were then called which subsequently became called county awards and er which were attainable in those days only at universities."
mm.
"and erm  er  we had er  each, there was a ministry of education form to be completed, a statistical return and erm when i first started there there were no seventeen university students with these major scholarships."
now it doesn't mean to say that there were only  seventeen people  in.
no.
east suffolk at university because a lot of erm the more well to do parents would erm would probably turn up their noses at the small amount of.
mm.
"of the value of the scholarship and not bother to apply in the first place, but the major scholarship was worth at its maximum a hundred and fifty pounds."
mm.
"a year, for three years."
mm.
and fifty pounds of that was loaned which had to be repaid at the end of the course in sixteen equal quarterly instalments.
"oh, i see."
erm  erm the collection of  of the loan was erm quite a major operation in itself because though erm there was a form of agreement and each agreement had to have two sureties and erm you could always go to the sureties if the student after the course.
mm.
"erm failed to pay up it erm, there were all sorts of circumstances which erm made it difficult for the student or difficult for the student or there were certain students who just erm tried to avoid paying altogether."
mm.
and erm at that time when we got to that sort of crisis we erm had to send a memo over to the er clerk of the council's department er.
"the clerk of the council is now, , the chief executive."
mm.
"and erm he would take er legal action or that was the idea, we hardly ever got any erm any  change  the legal department and as often as not it was written off."
"mm, probably cost as much to, to get the money back."
"oh yes yes, but erm this we found always was the case with the er county council legal department that er by the time they got round to it the people had  either  gone abroad or something had happened er."
mm.
so it was written off in the end.
mm.
"er the most interesting case erm, i remember was a chap who erm having completed his course erm joined the r a f and erm he was missing at dieppe when they had the rather abortive attempt at landing at dieppe during the war and er, but he was never  erm posted as  as erm having died and erm it was years afterwards, it was in the nineteen fifties in fact before we could get the department of education to agree to the loan being written off because erm obviously he was, by that time he had to be assumed as."
mm.
dead and not just missing.
mm.
"but erm another  funny story that er always sticks in my mind is er when we sent memos to the clerks' department and there was only the clerks' department, they were, they were trying to erm improve their public image as."
"we were told, the shortage of paper, we were told only to use  secondhand papers er paper that had already been used for letters or memos when writing to the clerks' department and erm we erm used to get the grubbiest paper that we could and then you had to condense it and type it erm without too much space  and erm that went over to the clerks' department, then erm when it got over oh sorry you had to trim off the edges erm there was no spare paper left around the memo er you know there was just this little bit of paper    with the."
yes.
message on it or the er instruction on it.
mm mm.
and then when it got over to the clerks' department they used to stick it on another piece of paper they could put it on the file.
"and er that may sound er exaggerated but i can assure you that's what happened, that er, to go to, to be able to file these, these little scraps of paper they had to  stick  it on another sheet."
yes.
it was rather funny.
"do you remember the introduction of, sort of computers or any sort of mechanized typewriters ?"
"not erm, not within the the time which we are talking about really."
no.
"this was erm well we were at county hall and er subsequently we erm, they built this what was described as a derelict aircraft carrier and."
mm.
"and er we moved because erm the department was splitting at the seams really, because immediately there was erm, the war was over and there were all sorts of plans for erm for development and that sort of thing and erm as i've already mentioned there were two, only two graduates in the whole of the education department who was mr  and er his personal assistant and erm then after the war there were three graduates appointed, all of them from erm, ex service men, there was arthur  who was erm lieutenant commander in the navy, there was erm bud , i can't remember his proper christian name."
he was in the r a f erm erm and then there was a chap named harold  who was lieutenant colonel from the army.
erm he subsequently went to erm huddersfield as chief education officer.
mm.
"but erm, and these people were assigned erm three separate sections erm, harold  , he took over further education which was a term which hadn't been erm, was not an accepted term in those days because we'd always er referred to it as higher education."
mm.
"and bud  was erm, dealt with schools and erm  er, no i'm sorry arthur  dealt with schools."
"bud  had a very special job, he erm, he was the post war planning and erm, he spent no end of time and er a great deal of research having er committee er committee meetings to do with the setting up of county colleges."
mm.
and erm the reorganizing of erm secondary education which all stemmed really from the nineteen forty four act.
mm.
yes.
"and erm er in the end , hardly any of it was implemented."
we never did get erm any county colleges.
mm.
"funds, funds were limited for school buildings."
"we er yes, yes, we erm, one thing that did happen was that the area schools as they were called in those days became erm, described as modern schools."
mm.
"and erm they was erm  quite funny really because erm rentham school was then rentham senior school erm was on the nineteen twenty six blacklist of schools erm for erm closing and er, erm resitting somewhere,."
mm.
"but er, under the nineteen forty four act,rentham senior school then became rentham modern school and we thought  we thought that the  silly term to go to a school which in nineteen twenty six had been er."
on the blacklist.
mm.
because there was erm before the war there was a blacklist of schools which  were due for reorganization and erm.
mm.
resiting.
"can you remember where any of the others were, on the blacklist?"
"er, no that was er erm, most of, most of the blacklist had been dealt with erm it had been a fair amount of erm reorganization and er rebuilding."
mm.
but erm.
course it was the butler act of nineteen forty four which set up this three stage.
"it was, yes."
national ladder.
"there was grammar, erm secondary, secondary grammar, secondary technical and secondary modern."
mm.
"but there again secondary technical erm really didn't get off the ground,."
mm.
erm there were  some erm secondary technical erm facilities at one or two of the schools  before the war.
"erm they had a machine, quite advanced machine shop at the leiston grammar school and er interestingly enough that became er used whilst the grammar school was evacuated as a training centre for erm ."
"er one of the members of staff of the leiston grammar school, a chap named johnny  erm, was his trainees and erm there again erm arthur  and our section became responsible for erm all this in-service training for er, er women mainly because the men had joined up and erm the  used to come in quite often and er he got, used to get so upset because he couldn't erm, he got at cross purposes with some of these ladies."
"and erm he was always talking about erm different types of lathe and chucks and things like that and er, none of us had any idea what  he was."
talking about it was far too technical for us but.
"erm arthur  used to listen and in the end er, i think johnny  went off, you know, satisfied that somebody had listened to him."
but erm that was erm financed by the ministry of labour at erm  as the erm education department were responsible for the  the general administration of it.
mm.
"and erm wickham market had erm machine centre erm, that was used during the war for erm certain courses er particularly for erm tractor drivers, they used to er have a week's course, they had to apply to the education committee and er we got these applications in and erm they spent a week at wickham market, then they used to stay in lodgings if they came from great distances and erm  they would learn about the maintenance of erm of tractors and er, i suppose it's quite a good thing really because er, it was difficult to get any repairs done in those days."
mm.
"and er that was one of tom  's extras because  i could  very well remember, erm we had very little  erm time off at christmas and there was one year that erm, we just had the christmas day and erm  erm tom had this meeting on the christmas eve to decide who should erm attend the next week's tractor course and erm, everybody was feeling in the, sort of christmas spirit and."
mm.
"er perhaps tom himself was erm not really concentrating very much but i know when we came back after the christmas day, the boxing day , erm, tom was  quite oblivious what had gone on on the on the christmas eve, so i remember we we put our heads together and erm came to erm some arrangement who should be  invited  for this next tractor course and nothing was ever said so i expect the right people went after all but erm it's funny how when  he was."
mm.
befuddled and i think everybody else was er.
unconcerned what was going on on the christmas eve.
mm.
the erm education for the forces was another erm.
"oh yes, you mentioned that."
"another sideline and erm  there again erm mr  who er kept a finger in, in a lot of pies, he erm with the w e a and erm the cambridge extra mural board of studies."
"he was very friendly with erm  who was the extra mural board and erm  then possibly this connection erm we were asked by the erm ministry of defence to provide lectures and courses for erm units of h m forces stationed in the area and erm so a panel of lecturers was erm formed and erm they used to go out, the, the units used to have their own education officers, usually a sergeant or perhaps a second lieutenant and erm they used to come into the office and say that they'd like somebody to go out to their searchlight unit or a a unit stationed somewhere out in the sticks and er lecture on this that or the other and erm we were supposed to try and fix them up and erm the panel erm, it had quite a number of erm people on it that erm, i can't remember  who they all were, i know that erm   you'd hardly believe this but there was a chap named mr  and another chap named mr."
yes .
"and they used to erm, they were ornithologists."
"and they used to go out to these units and take slides and er lecture to the, to the men about birds and er natural history and mr  himself he, he was famous for three different lectures that he used to offer."
"one was from erm  from baghdad to barqu and the other one was from barqu to basrah because he was in the first world war, i think he was serving with the middlesex regiment and erm, i don't know how he managed this, i never did understand."
"anyway, he was a captain in the army and he had these slides of erm his, his journeys erm er in arabia and he used to show this with er great regularity not only to erm units of h m forces but also to the er shifts, the a r p shifts he used to amuse them by."
mm.
showing these films.
"then he had another one about er gertrude  who was erm, i never did know very much about gertrude  but she was erm a lady of some repute in er in egypt at erm either just before or just after the first world war."
"then erm, there were people who lectured on er gate courses on elementary german, there was a friend of doctor , who used to go out and, to units and erm give lessons in german and erm  there were, there was a unit of polish erm soldiers stationed, they had an armoured train, believe it or not, which was erm parked at saxmundham and erm , particularly at night, they used to trample up and down the line."
"now what they, what they were supposed to do erm i never did know but there were quite a number of these er men who lived in this train and they had a lieutenant who's quite a handsome chap by all accounts, he used to come into the office a chap named lieutenant  and erm erm this was one of the things that landed on joyce  's er plate and er she used to meet these education officers and arrange for courses and in the er in lieutenant  's case there was er, instruction in english which erm erm stanley  who was a headmaster of er  area school he undertook classes for these polish chaps  but er so often these erm, these units were only in the area for a limited space of time so you couldn't arrange anything very, very comprehensive."
mm.
"erm  i remember  one er, i think it was bedfield hall or some big house at bedfield where erm they had erm erm a hostel for wrens, i think they were probably in training there and erm their education officer came in and wanted us to arrange a course erm and she wanted it described as a school for brides."
"about erm, you know early marriage and all this  sort of thing  and erm that was a bit of a puzzle because erm, nobody  knew really  what to."
mm.
"lay on for them  and erm  also erm, i know, people like erm mr  and mr  they used to  be picked up by er, by some chaps in a jeep or army truck."
"they used to go all the way out to these erm searchlight stations and erm they used to, very often they, they were situated in a, in a sort of pit in a dug out and erm when they arrived er the education officer had forgotten to tell the, the troops that there was a lecture that they were supposed to attend and er nobody turned up."
they used to get erm these people on the election panel used to be paid a couple of guineas a time for their lectures.
mm.
but they were always erm unhappy when they gave up so much time and er there was nobody there to listen  to them when  when they got there.
unfortunate really.
"erm, another lecturer that i can remember was erm a chap named  who was head at reydon r e y school near southwold."
he was very interested in astronomy and he used to lecture on the stars and that sort of thing.
"erm, it has to be remembered that all these lectures, or most of them, were erm voluntary compulsion and the men used to turn up because they were told to and er they showed little or no interest very often and it was all  erm well a bit of a waste of time."
mm.
mm.
what would you say were some of your happiest memories of your time spent with the county council?
"erm  ah, erm  i think i was reasonably happy most of the time, erm i know if i can look at the other side of the coin erm, i became apprehensive as the war went on and er, obviously it wasn't going to last much longer."
mm.
"er men were coming, young men were coming the forces and er they wanted their jobs back and er i began to wonder what was going to happen to me, if, because i was on the temporary staff and erm there was no guarantee that i'd be able to stay erm, and then erm i was thinking of probably getting married and erm  er the salary at that stage wasn't er, wasn't very much to  get  married on."
"i can't remember exactly what it was but er it erm had gone up since erm, since i first started."
"but i certainly remember going to mr  and erm, i felt very bold when i went and said that er, you know, sooner or later i'd erm, i'd get married and er set up a home and that sort of thing and erm i said er, what are the prospects of erm getting a reasonable salary?"
he was then on a salary of about four hundred a year i think.
so it gives you some idea of what the salaries were like in those days.
mm.
"he said, erm, well what would you think was reasonable?"
"er what would you be able to manage on, sort of thing and i said about two hundred and  fifty  a year and er, you know, that was quite realistic in those days but erm obviously it wouldn't go very far now, would it?"
no .
it wouldn't.
"but erm, if i could just erm  erm expand a bit on this erm  on this erm major awards, er because it was quite interesting, particularly the present er, uncertainty about what's going to happen about students' grants."
mm.
"erm  just er when i first started, i've already mentioned i think that erm there are about seventeen  erm students at universities with major scholarships within the maximum of this erm hundred and fifty pounds a year and erm we had to interview all these erm applicants, erm which wasn't a very arduous task because  there weren't  so many of them but."
mm.
"we had to get erm reports from the examining boards erm on their performances, in the higher school certificate exam erm, they had to take two main subjects and two subsidiaries and the recommendations of the examining boards, then, , they er received a major award or, or they didn't but erm there was a consolation prize for those who didn't erm get a major award  because there were a few, what they called, special loans  erm offered by the education committee."
these were fifty pounds a year.
mm.
"and, but , they were loans and had to be repaid at the end of the course."
"er teacher training erm, which was then, , a two year course."
"erm, they were not interviewed, they  if they were accepted by a teacher training college they received erm a maximum of, of fifty pounds a year but erm as far as i can remember there was no loan erm element in that but i i may be wrong because er but i never can remember erm writing to recover loans from the training college student."
mm.
"but erm, after the erm forty four act , things began to er develop quite quickly and erm  we then had what we called erm discretionary awards or minor awards we called them in the first place."
mm.
"erm for various things and er one of the earliest er minor awards which the education committee had was to erm a girl from  ruth  who wanted to take erm erm a course for erm the n p s, the pharmaceutical er society's."
mm.
"exams and erm she was about the first i think and there was erm somebody else who wanted to take a course in erm youth leadership but erm, very quickly the numbers increased till the time i left  we, we were dealing with thousands."
mm.
"literally thousands and the expenditure had, had gone well over a million pounds."
mm.
"but that was er not until  oh at the time of reorganization that we, the numbers increased dramatically then with erm, when we took the borough students over and er also those from west suffolk."
mm.
but i erm became responsible for erm awards.
"well i say responsible, i was really responsible to erm the what we that were then known as assistant education officers."
"erm, but erm, i had was allowed a great deal of latitude."
"i don't know whether, people thought that erm if they interfered with me i wouldn't er  i wouldn't play or what it was but then, anyway  erm when the war ended, as i say i got erm worried and erm i then got er mr  who was then er, then taken over from sir cecil  clerk of the council or chief executive and erm, he suggested that erm i might take a course for the erm home workers diploma for the blind which erm was, well it was a sort of specialized er social worker really."
"they used to have people specializing for erm, erm blind individuals."
mm.
"so erm, both my wife."
"my wife used to  work  in the education department, incidentally."
"and erm, we both decided we'd take this diploma and er mr  erm in his kindness let us erm erm go off to the workshops and do some practical work and erm my wife lived at stow upland and i was lodging in ipswich and er  he even allowed us to study in the, in the erm enquiry office in the evenings."
i think he was apprehensive  about that because he didn't know whether erm he was doing right by allowing us to be together in the.
enquiry office after office hours anyway.
"erm, we did er the studies and erm i took the diploma."
"phil, my wife, erm had measles just at the time of the exam."
so she didn't.
"take it in the end but erm anyway i got this diploma and er then i was quite annoyed because erm  social services then erm the welfare for the blind was dealt with by the public health department and a vacancy occurred in the public health department for erm blind welfare officer, or a welfare officer for the blind and i applied for it and erm, they er didn't make an appointment because they didn't er get in other applications but they they didn't  offer me the appointment."
so i had a bit of an up and a downer and er erm created quite a stir with erm mr  the clerk of the council professor.
"i thought this was very unfair and erm, but then  luckily really because erm i don't think i would have let the job would have been difficult er i'd had my wife as, for transporting me around to these various people."
"erm  i then, erm sent a memo to the erm county er clerk of the council and erm applied for upgrading and erm  so i was then taken, i was put on the permanent staff."
"taken off the typist's grade what was then called higher clerical and erm given the job of erm  looking out for erm er awards, er both university and teacher training and."
"erm the minor awards or discretionary awards as they became and that's erm, i was given this job and er that's how it's  built up really over the years."
mm.
it started from something erm quite small and finished up with  something  fairly large  really.
yes.
"and it's it's been a very fascinating job because  in the course of the years, obviously one has met erm, parents and students and lecturers and erm university tutors we've got to know quite well because erm there were all sorts of problems as you probably know with."
mm.
in these establishments.
mm.
and er the students themselves have all sorts of problems and latterly we had erm a great number of mature students.
mm.
"and er  as often as not they were ladies who had been separated or divorced and er they had all, a lot of sort of marital problems and it  became  almost a, a welfare of job."
as much as erm a grant situation.
mm.
"the grants, the  of the grants increased over the years and the main thing about erm awards was to assess them and this is something which erm, i always felt a bit self conscious about because, we had this erm very comprehensive form where parents and erm, oh individuals when they were the students themselves had to complete and give very precise details of income."
mm.
"and financial circumstances and erm, this was something that i had to leave to the people who were working got himself another job."
"erm, nobody really kn was the most monotonous job when you had to erm assess literally thousands of students in the end."
mm.
"and erm, i always felt sorry for the people working in inland revenue because er,they were, they were  having to do it all the time."
mm.
"but erm, we never used to get the new rates of grants and the new regulations out from the erm ministry until oh early june and all this work had to be done, erm, obviously before the."
mm.
new term new academic year started.
mm.
"and everybody was clamouring to know how much they were going to get and er we were always trying to head them off by saying that er, theirs was next  on the list   and er."
mm.
so sometimes students would get their grants quite late ?
we always tried to get some payment to them before a term started.
mm.
"erm, it never, with reorganization it was a bit of a problem because erm  i well  remembers too just after reorganization the county treasurers took all the telephones off the hook, so there was no communication between our department and theirs."
"so you couldn't tell whether their, whether a student's cheque had gone out or not."
oh dear.
and there was no contact department er it got really chaotic.
"and erm computers didn't help in the slightest because er, i think the er, i may be wrong about this but as i understood it erm the computer programmer worked for west suffolk but at the time of reorganization he'd got himself another job."
"erm, nobody really knew how to program the erm,."
"the thing and in those days they used to have the punched cards, you know, erm they still have this."
yes.
and erm they used to have to send these cards to birmingham to be processed and there used to be a van going out from er milner house to birmingham.
i think two or three times a week.
"and erm, they had er, er a lot of girls over at birmingham who used to prepare these cards for the computer."
mm.
"but erm, it was erm  rather silly really."
"right well, thank you mr  it's been a  a long and varied career."
it's erm.
eventful.
"it hasn't really been erm all that eventful but by staying put going off at, i, i'd, i'd thought about, at one time, erm emigrating to new zealand but er  erm when i found out what the conditions were like out there i decided to stay and er."
mm.
"we had the young children then erm all in all i am not sorry that things turned out as they did because erm as luck would have it, you know,."
mm.
it's er worked quite well.
mm.
and er i managed to get er do forty odd years and erm now i'm quite happy on the pension that  they gave me .
you retired in nineteen eighty?
"er july nineteen eighty, yes."
mm.

without without actually saying where it was.
"that's right, yes."

"no you don't.  because er i naturally i went away to work but er i was born here and er you see and, and what else did you want?"
"where were you born, because you must be one of the oldest residents in needham?"
"yes, i, i was born in this house but er  i don't wish people to know er  because er this is a funny world, i, i don't know whether that's being recorded i expect."
"yes, it will all be that will go down on."
"because er  well i er i, as i  and i've got young neighbours who i very seldom see because they are out at work  er therefore i am quiet and that's how i like to be."
yes.
an.
"er erm, well i mean we, we live in a strange world."
"mm,."
it's all very different to when i was young.
"yes, yes."
what did your father do?
oh my father was a shoemaker.
really?
yes and he worked in the high street and er he  what would you say  suppose that's the proper word.
"he lived down gypsy lane with his two sisters, he was a single man you see and my father and mother lived here and my, they not only mended shoes but they made them and er course naturally, you know, well needham wasn't as big as it is now but they made them for the best people, if that, if that's the right, not the right expression say, but er but you know what i mean er and er and he, you know, all his life you see he did that and then one day he had a shock because his er, what would you call him colleague, he, he died suddenly in the night."
so my father said what shall i do?
"i said, well just carry on and so he used this er workshop at the back."
"the black  and there was all cement drawn and everything and we had a big table in there and he just carried on  he  didn't make shoes  and he died when he was er, well he had a bad stroke and, and he was in the other room for seven years."
"you see they didn't do things then that they would have done  today, you see, seven years  and you see i at that time, well i used to used to have a day off and having a half day a week we used to have full day a fortnight and so on my day off i came home to see what i can do to help, you see and er my mother died."
my father died in nineteen forty six and my mother died in nineteen fifty seven.
"well my husband and i were married in nineteen forty four, you see, and er as you see i go every year  and it's nineteen eighty six, so therefore erm i you see i, i don't really want people to know my age."
mm.
"you see because living here like this and er i mean, i mean only yesterday i heard of an  people burst in the door and  this old lady on the head and where's your money and that sort of thing, you know, so it's really terrible."
mm.
"it's a lovely world, beautiful world but it's the people in it you see who are spoiling things so much and i don't understand youngsters you see but because young people erm there, there  was a time when youngsters just er do just as they like and they weren't reprimanded by the parents, whereas my parents were very strict you see and it didn't do me any harm and i'm glad they were."
we were brought up nicely to go with my father who used to sing in the church choir.
they haven't one now.
"well i was sent to the erm united, well it wasn't a united reform church then but it was called the chapel and i was sent to there, to sunday school there, mornings and afternoon and we went two by two across to the chapel, you see, so while my father, we used to walk down the street together."
"he went to church and i went to the chapel, you see."
"so he sang in the c of e church, church of england?"
"oh yes and there were eight choir men, you see, well  no choir there hadn't been for years, you see so er and i had a photograph somewhere of my father with eight choir men, you see,and er well after that."
"did they have a, did they have a band or anything in the church or did they sing without music?"
er well they've got a piped organ there and er oh someone plays the organ yes.
"an old gentleman from stowmarket, his name's mr  i'm sure it was because er, you see, my father and i used to go up stowmarket road sometimes after church or chapel and er and go for a walk up there and used to meet this mr  who played the organ  stowmarket and very  course  but erm but i had a wonderful life really."
mm.
"and then, as i say when i was sixteen well erm when i left needham school, you see, i passed through."
"i missed several classes because they put me up in, i, when i came up from the infants to the big school i missed the first standard and they put me into standard two and i went from two, three, four, five, six, seven and  seven and i was only eleven, you see, so i did pretty well and then the headmaster came to my parents and said, why don't you let her go in for a scholarship to stowmarket secondary and so i went in for that and er there was one other girl went , there were two of us and erm, and we only heard during the summer break and er  we passed."
"now this other girl came down one saturday morning  and we had a letter to say that i'd passed and i said well, so have i."
"we did so hope that we'd both pass, you see, because, you know,been terrible."
how old were you when you passed that scholarship?
"well i i was eleven but by the time but i had a birthday, you see, er in the summer and er er well august actually and so when i started at stowmarket i was twelve, you see, and er and er i was at stowmarket school and  scholarship for four years and er  well  i don't know whether i really liked school, did you?"
"bits of it, not all of it."
"no that's right, as i say but erm anyway then after that when i left at say sixteen, you see, er er er a friend of ours who was a railway clerk at needham station came and told us that they were taking on girls on the railway company and would i like to do it  and so i had to pass exams and er actually, can i read some notes that."
yes.
oh this er when i said er  i was just looking through again because last night i sat up late writing these.
"and then i got in a muddle and i was so tired i was, because it's my eyes you see."
mm.
i can't see very well.
yes and i can't see anything without my magnifying glass.
without your.
yes i know i'll read this first page.
mm.
"and, and erm i put after leaving needham market school, i won a scholarship to stowmarket secondary school for four years."
then i was told that girls were being taken on the railways so i had to go to ipswich and take two more exams and started work as a booking clerk at needham station when i was sixteen.
i learned how to use the single needle telegraph instrument.
well now i don't know whether you know anything about that but it's a  make  words.
morse code is it?
oh yes  er yes code yes then i had to learn that.
"and er, you see, and i can still do it because  i know  n d n d n d and they keep answering that."
"i know it's, i knew it was needham station and it was between station to station, you see, not er anything to do with the public but that's where i learnt  so we used to er take er messages from station to station and i used to speak to the girl at merrith down the line."
"she was also the stationmaster's daughter, you see, and we used to talk to telephone  you see and erm, well that's as far as i've got now."
i hope you're finding it.
this is just what i want to hear.
"oh  oh well, yes, well er i i know about  take two more exams and er i know the second one was mental arithmetic."
"mental arithmetic and reading and i also had er er take an eye test because they said if there was a train accident and i couldn't see the signal whether it was red or green or whatever, you see, you never know."
"so i had to take an eye test, i remember."
"erm and er  oh yes, er no wait a minute i had and take two  and started work as a booking clerk, i've said that before at needham station when i was sixteen."
"i learned how to use the single needle pantograph instrument, sending and taking messages from station to station."
issuing tickets and taking in parcels.
"the parcel door was the other end of the office you see and er oh i loved it, i loved the work i really did."
"i took early and late turns with the chief clerk, you see, and er well there were two lads who did a middle turn but i needn't mention that, but they did a sort of nine to six you see."
"mm, and you would do, which turns would you do?"
you'd be early and late.
early early and late.
how early?
"seven o'clock in the morning at seven o'clock till four, i think it was and then er it would be two till ten, you see, but the stationmaster was always about just i was late er you know, not there by seven."
to book out the seven ten train.
so he was always always there and such a kind man he was and er yes  chief clerk.
the clerk whose job i took went on the district as a relief clerk and later relief stationmaster.
"i am talking about during the first world war, you see."
"i was there until the end of the first war, what some people called the great war, anyway, the first war that'd be and i was there until nineteen nineteen."
well it was over in nineteen eighteen.
"however, i stayed longer and when all the girls, all of us had three months' notice to leave, it was dreadful, you see, because we were fully trained by that time you see."
"but er, course i'm talking, i'm forgetting all this is being recorded."
"it's alright, don't worry about it."
"oh, you'll sort it out later on."
yes we'll sort it out don't worry.
"yes, and the girls had three months' notice to leave and on the last day at  three months i heard that a young lady had left the post office."
"i went to see the postmistress and she said i've known you all my life, so start work on monday morning because, you see, it was so quick and i hadn't got my references back from the railway company but  that's what she said er i can start work on monday morning."
"i enjoyed the work, issuing dog licences, gun licences and old age pensions and stamps."
when did the old age pension come in?
well i can't remember but my parents got it but when it first came in i can't remember the year but.
no.
i was too young but it was about five shillings a week.
is that all it was?
was that for a couple or single?
"no, i think, i think they got ten shillings between them."
if i remember rightly.
yes.
but i can't.
"i have no idea of the date when it started but erm  and it er anyway, it's better now thank goodness."
erm  whilst there i learn how to use another sort of telegraph instrument.
when i was at the post office.
"er taking off and sending telegrams, you see, erm then i was told that the railway company were taking girls on again, so i applied and i had to go to ipswich to pass two more exams, you see, and er and started work and the in the catering manager's office at ipswich station as, as a clerk doing typing and general office work as the manager had to go on the district."
every day to the ten refreshment rooms.
"so he was starting at chelmsford, witham, marks tey, colchester, ipswich erm bury st edmunds, newmarket er down so far, manningtree and er there were ten altogether."
"so what do you prepare, helped prepare the food for all the trains?"
oh no i didn't do any cooking.
you didn't?
i was just in the office.
aha.
i was just in the office typing and er and general office work and while he went on the district you see.
there was only the  i was going to say but when they had oh when i was in the  i went to evening classes to learn pitman's shorthand.
"erm, i was at ipswich station for ten years."
mm.
you see.
"now when they were busy and had important people in our dining room at ipswich, there was one, there were two waiters."
"er, one and another one who did, who was a waiter but part-time  when they had somebody important in, which i think i've put down here, that one's finished with."
but did that be for the staff catering?
would that be the  that you are talking about the canteen for staff.
erm well.
dining room?
"the dining room, oh yes the dining room i was."
"that would be for the staff, railway staff?"
mm.
oh no every er er ordinary customers.
"oh, i see."
"oh, i see actually, it was actually at the station?"
oh yes.
"different now when it, where it's just a cafe isn't it?"
i don't know i haven't been up for years.
"you don't, i mean they don't have proper dining rooms ."
don't they?
no.
oh.
"no, that's why i was wondering."
oh goodness.
there isn't at the station for the customers.
yes.
just like rolls now and a cup of tea.
"oh my word, how it's gone down."
well what sort of meals  did you have to provide?
well i can tell you.
i've written it all down.
"oh really, oh good."
"yes i, you see, in those days it was quite different."
yes.
"you see er  what it's like now it was a large  adjoining the, the, the large room, what they call the  you see and over the, over the other, across the line, to the railway line there was another place called the down bar and the tea room adjoined."
i don't know whether they're open.
"no,."
not there?
"no, nothing like that there."
"i can't believe it, you see i thought things were still as they were."
"no, they're not."
i think you'd find it hard to recognize the old railway station now.
"well every, you know erm i can remember the time er when i first went and they used to have silver er plated , silver plated water jugs on the counter and silver plated sugar bowls with tongs and loaf sugar for people to use and well and when you see the war came along, you see, they were all taken away because, you see, we had troop trains we were up day and night so  the troops with tea."
"you'd get a message from the r t o the er railway transport office to say supply three hundred and sixty cups of tea at such and such a time and then the troops would  the train would start, the troops pour out and pour into our place and there we were dashing around."
i used to help and we were up day and night.
"i've got a, a photograph somewhere where we had this trestle table er on the platform and if you were  the tea and the men had to stay overtime, they didn't get paid for it and we, we it was a seven day week for us, we were never paid for sunday."
it was seven days a week.
"we had every other sunday off, you see, but otherwise we worked and didn't get any extra for it but the girls like myself well erm  we couldn't lift these huge urns of tea so they had two men keep them on, you see, and er, and we were er perhaps i know one day we didn't finish until five o'clock in the morning."
"and we'd been up all night serving troops and er, you see, and then the manager said, well look er  now and have some breakfast before we get another telegram and we were next door to the telegram office, you see, and when, when the erm war, during the war, you see, the man would come the telegraph office and he would say er  and er, you see, all the lights went out except a few lights along the back of the counter."
"then he'd come red and you'd know that erm a bombing raid was imminent, you see, and er er  when i look back you know, but as i say everything has changed so much."
", you're talking about all the troops coming through."
was it ipswich station?
yes.
"and yet when is it, when were you working there because i thought you said you'd finished."
you worked at needham during the war and then went to ipswich.
"ah, yes, well after i left needham, then i went to the post office for a year."
yeah.
which i told you.
yeah.
"but you see erm, well i wanted to get on."
yes.
"and i thought i can be here until i'm ninety, you know,."
"yes, and not get anywhere."
that's it.
mm.
"and so when i heard about taking on girls again, on the railway."
but they were still getting troops and bombing raids?
"oh yeah, well it was during the nineteen fourteen eighteen war."
"oh yes, you see, they, i mean."
"but i think that you were working then at ipswich, i thought you were just at needham."
"er well er, it was when, no let me think i went to ipswich, i did a  till the first war ended."
i see what you mean.
mm.
"well, and i went to ipswich well it must have been just after the war then."
mm.
"but you see er, yes that's right and then i'm, since then i was up at cambridge and that was during the second year."
yeah.
"you see, so yeah and er we used to have as i say er, well i've been up in the office."
"if they had important people  like er mark  and his wife, the pianist, erm you've heard of him ."
"well he, he, they were on their way to norwich but they stopped off at ipswich for a lunch, you see, and er i  had, i looked after them, so, it shouldn't interrupt the other girls behind the counter or, or the waiter who was looking after his regular customers in the dining room, you see, er and so i used to erm and once i had  i remember there was six black doctors came in and er and i was glad because it was nice to move about and sticking in the office typing and then going out all alone, you see, while the manager was on the district, you see, i liked it and er  anyway that was a long time ago."
yes.
"so in the in the dining room, they had waiters ?"
"oh, yes."
"they had er his name was jimmy  they had er well one used one old gentleman used to be a  yes and his name was jimmy , the waiter, that's right i, i get a, i have to think because i, i sometimes get mixed up and i'm at cambridge and you see  it was a long time ago, you see, so, since i was young and i was then."
well i can tell you i went to cambridge er on er the twenty eighth of december nineteen thirty one.
"well that's fifty, how long, well i daren't think."
mm.
fifty years ago.
yeah.
you see and.
oh.
that's a long time.
yes.
i'm sure you don't want to hear all this.
"i'm really interested about ipswich station just cos it's, it's so different now."
yes.
"that they used to have waiters and tables with silver, plated silver."
"oh, yes."
and tablecloths.
"er no they didn't have tablecloths, no, er in the dining room."
"yeah, in the dining room."
"oh yes, but not in the ordinary er there was a huge place, where you could put tables all round  the tables, you see, and, and er it was a  and er  i liked it,i, when they were busy, you see, i used to, especially if they had an order for these hundreds of cups of tea, er, you see, i used to go down and give a hand then, i used to like it, you see, somebody would give a shout and i would come down from the office and  and left them anyway and then er i heard of this job."
"i thought well after ten years, i thought, well i want  i still want to get on and erm  so i heard of this job down at cambridge station as assistant manageress at the refreshment rooms, you see, and er it wasn't quite the same because er at ipswich, you see, although the catering manager's office er my work was office work and typing you know  general thing and er because he was away most of the day, most days, er er the ten stations er from stretching as i say from chelmsford, witham, marks tey, colchester and er i think it was clacton and er and manningtree and er i think, i don't know  manningtree and ipswich and er then er bury st edmunds and, and that's it and i am not sure whether you went to newmarket or whether to whether to cambridge now  newmarket but er, you see, so the days went on and we worked every other sunday and i know things were cheaper then but you see the pay wasn't, wasn't very good."
"no, how much would you have earned?"
"well because i was in the office i got a pound a week, you see,and the, do you know the manageress there who, she was the manageress then sorry, i've got a photograph and she said that when she was manageress at colchester and she only got fifteen shillings a week."
"i and the girls, that's, that's all they got fifteen shillings because i was in the office i got a pound  and mind you we slept in, we had all our food, you see, and we had to all sleep in."
where at the actual.
on the station.
"on the station, at ipswich station."
on the station.
they have rooms?
"oh yes, upstairs, they're still there i expect i don't know."
goodness.
we slept there you see.
so what you had your own room and.
"well no i had to share a room with a, with a, i think there were five beds."
"four other girls, that's right and there were housemaids there to do the work and er yes housemaids and er and er you know and in the, in the kitchen, you see, there was the chef and er a cook, the kitchen maid and er a young man,a boy, well just left school to scrub the tables down and do the floors and that sort of thing  and er and and er while i, i had to go down every day to type, to see what the chef said, what was on the menu and type it, type out the menus, you see, that was one of my jobs and er and if  let me think, yes there was quite a number of staff, that's just in the kitchen."
mm.
"you see and i i suppose there was about ten or a dozen girls behind the counter because it was early and late turn for them because you see we were open, you see, until ten o'clock at night, you see, and er then, well, anyway, after that erm i heard about this job going as assistant manageress at cambridge  and er so i applied and the manager said to me, i thought well i'll be here ten years, erm i can be here until i'm  you know, donkeys years and er so he said well look you may not get a job because he said that another girl coming from norwich to go to cambridge to see the manager you and so you might not get it, she might get it, and, however, i went and er i, i met the manager and the manageress in the front office, the manager's office and we all had a chat but i didn't see the girl from norwich, she must have gone some other day and anyway i got the job, you see, and er, and so i went to cambridge as assistant manageress and i  very well and i got to know all kinds of people, all nationalities being a university city."
"well it was a town then but since then it's been made a city, you see, and i got to know all kinds of people and one gentleman came in there, used to come every evening and write a book  and er, i used to look after him if i happened to be that end and er, you see, and then he'd say, oh just an exchange you know about the weather and just thing and then i'd leave him and he'd get on with his writing and one day he said to me."
"when i've finished this book and it's published, i'll give you one  he said you won't understand anything about it because it's all about electronics and electricities but he said never mind and, and he did and it's up on that shelf, er  i've still got it ."
yes and.
never read it?
"well, er er er it's all on, well i couldn't understand it, he said, but he said i'll give you one because he said after all i wrote it here didn't i?"
"you see, he was exceptionally nice and he used to lecture at the colleges and er he was a real, very nice gentleman and er and so he, he, he, he took his drink across to the table with him and sometimes i took it for him it just depend and he, he wrote this book and er  i forget now, perhaps you would like to read and see what he says."
"the second book down, it's with a mauve coloured book."
that one yes.
elementary technical electricity by samuel.

"with compliments and kind regards, robert samuel ."

yes.
you see  yes.
extraordinary.
it is isn't it?
"yes, yes."
"yes, yes he gave me one."
yes  i thought  you know when i retired and left cambridge i ought to bring that with me you see.
"oh, yes."
"and , as i say, being at cambridge there was a little theatre there and er we used to see so many of the actors and actresses that used to come into our lives  you see because there were five places on the station, , there was the tea room adjoining the , there was a large kiosk,large kiosk one girl in there, you see, and er there was, then there was this large  which is the biggest and then the dining room  that, you see and er so and, and one year i, i wrote it down but erm, one year i remember we took forty four thousand pounds which was a lot of money and er, you see, well er i got on very well with the girls."
and you ran all this?
you were all this?
"no not, not till the manageress, i was just going to tell you about that."
"the manageress there  erm i was there and she, i, after i'd been there eighteen months, she had a heart attack and the girl  took up her tea tray, one of the girls took up her, because she wasn't on duty till about just  quarter to six to do the money."
"it was my job to go to all these various places and collect the money and take the numbers on the till and collect the money and put it in a bag, put it in the safe."
"that was my work, then when she came down on duty, she would sit one side of the table with her books and i would sit the other and count all the money, you see, then i would take this money er, in a bag, through the black  through the, past the ticket collector and take it to the booking office and they took it from me and took it when they took their money to the bank, you see."
"well do you know  sometimes i'd taken it through and perhaps a train would come in, a london train would come in and people were crowding through."
"we never thought anything about being mugged in those days, you see,and er  and that's what happened, as i say, so we took lots and lots of money,."
you see and er.
so you were a sort of assistant manageress ?
"yes but you see at this time the girl took up her tea tray and, and when she took, she knocked on the door and when she opened the door the manageress was lying on the floor."
"foaming at the mouth, she'd had a heart attack."
"well she came running to me, you see, and we immediately phoned for the doctor, you see but, however, and i said, look, phone for the doctor, i said, and then i said go across to the railway police just across the yard and i asked one of them to come to me and i said i will go up with her and be with her until the doctor arrived, er he was with her the police sergeant when she died."
"there was me , you see, and there was nothing we could do and er she'd had this erm, it was awful, they took her to the mortuary because some of the girls, you see, erm, you know they went hysterical and er i'm not gonna pass her door, that sort of thing."
"er, you know, well they were young girls and er, you see and there's, there was nothing we could do, you see, and, and er, anyway the doctor, the doctor did come, it was  because the young staff er they had to, they took her away to the mortuary, you see and erm then i, i had to carry on with her work and, and do the best i could and mine , you see, but er the manager he appointed another assistant manager to go and collect the money which i used to do got it in because i took her times of duty and er, you see, and then after that er after several weeks i suppose it was, i don't know how many because i forget how many, that they appointed me as manageress and i  was in that position for twelve years, you see and."
until you retired?
"until i and, well until my husband retired at sixty and i thought well if he's going to retire at sixty, i might retire, you see."
so when was that?
.
"er, that would be oh well he was a, he was a railway clerk er on the station."
"at cambridge, is that where you met him?"
"yes, that's where i met him."
yes.
"he used to come into our place and erm, and er, i always knew when he was every night, hale, rain, snow whatever, he was there, you see and he used to have his pint of bitter, no more or no less and er, you see and all his friends, there were six of them."
"all bachelors, stood along the counter, you see, and er they were all good friends and though some of them had, had retired, one had retired and we, well there most of them had retired because er my husband was fifteen years older than me and er yes  anyway erm he, he, he retired, let me see, we married er when i was forty four, you see and erm  he would then be, well no, yes he'd be just fifty nine, you see but nevertheless, we had thirty two years very happily married and so when he died, he was ninety one."
yes and he was buried up at creeting you see.
"he was cremated and buried up at creeting in my parents' grave and that's what's going to happen to me, you see i will be cremated because erm, you know they make a sort of well and take off the top stone and the pebbles and things and er and then  the ashes go in the  and so  in a casket don't they and you see and so we shall."
all be together.
be together.
you see.
"yes, yes."
in my parents' grave.
"so when you retired you came to live here, was that it?"
"well yes and er so after that, you see, when he retired at sixty."
"mind you he was, this is my husband."
"oh, i thought that might be him, yes."
"there, isn't he handsome?"
yes.
"now he was a, oh, he was seventy one when that was taken."
he doesn't look it.
no.
i mean he could be in his fifties.
"oh yeah, he doesn't look it."
he's a very young.
picture of me when i was younger.
"oh yes, yes."
but i forget how old i was.
but he was really handsome.
yes.
and so.
he was.
"so quiet and so well respected, he was so kind, you see, and so i'm grateful and before i married, you see, i, we used to have three passes."
"i had three a year and times you we had quarter fare if we want to go anywhere, you see and er it was the old money in those days and i would come from ipswich to see my parents here for sixpence halfpenny then and er, you see, i used to go on holiday alone."
now really as far as you're concerned er i could tell you a lot about our holidays we had.
that's amazing that you went on holiday alone because surely you would have done much.
"well you know i, i wouldn't do it now."
"no, no."
"i wouldn't do it now because i, ever since that, that woman was on the train was stabbed and thrown out, i wouldn't go alone on holidays now but in those days, well maybe i was a lot, course i was younger then but you never heard of such things."
but it sounds as if you were a very independent person.
oh i was.
yes.
"oh i was and i used to go, and the first place i went to, let me think, it was dunoon."
"i wanted to go to scotland and i remember i came to say goodbye to my parents and that was in the evening and i went by train to liverpool street and it was pouring with rain and i had to make my way, i had a taxi across to euston, you see, and er and i went up the left side of the country, see, past carlisle and  and then  across and across  and then and to greenock er er to dunoon, you see."
"how do you spell that, i can't think of the name."
dunoon?
yes.
er it's er d u n double o n isn't it?
"oh, yes, yes  it is a scottish place."
"oh yes, it's in scotland, you see, and whilst there, you see, every day er because a lady laughed at me and she said, she was staying in the same hotel and she said er i, i used to book up in advance but never took a chance."
"i used to book up in advance and i thought oh go to dunoon, you see and er i got a free pass, so i went and erm she said talk about a holiday, she said soon you've had your breakfast you're off."
i said well that's what i came for.
so what did you do when you.
up and down the lochs.
yes.
"up and down different ones, different loch  and er you could see inveraray castle in the distance we, er after we married we went to inveraray castle, went over it."
"how old were you when you went, first went to dunoon then?"
"oh goodness, well."
you must have been in about in your mid twenties?
er  well i started going for a holiday by myself when i was about er.
what.
"when i was sixteen because it's then i started to get these free passes and i had a sister then who lived at rye and i had never been across london so the next door neighbour came with me to see me across london er because i was so young you see and i said right you show me across london i can come back alone, you see, and so i came back alone and i, that's when i started, so from sixteen and er and as i say i went to cambridge in the nineteen thirty one, it was the last day of  well say nineteen thirty two, you see, and, and also in the twenties i was going on holiday alone and i went to once er to the isle of man and when i was er i, i sat next, well being by myself, you see, they put me in, to a little table near the wall."
i booked up in advance .
"they put me by a table er near the wall but it for a table for two and then another lady came by herself, i remember her name was miss  and erm and she said, have you been here before?"
"i said, no, and she said oh i have lots of times, i only live at manchester, you see, and , you had to go by boat you see, and i caught the boat train from ipswich at eight o'clock in the morning and i got to manchester at lunchtime about one and then went liverpool and the train there took us almost down to the docks."
"well when i went to the isle of man, see, i went on the boat and er, you see, and er it only cost me ninepence for a, a landing er for the landing stage."
i had to save ninepence because i had these free passes.
"three a year which was very nice and er oh well whilst i was there, you see, erm i landed up in, in peel because i was going on and she said to me one day this miss  er what are you doing today?"
"and i said er, well i'm going on a coach trip to around the island and she said, may i come with you?"
"i said, and i said it would be nice company and so she said er  you sit near the window, i've seen it lots of times before, as i only live in manchester."
so she the two of us went together.
"well we went off, we got off at peel which was the other side as you know and there was peel castle right on the hill there and erm well after, and she said we won't go to these sea front cafes, well i know a nice restaurant, she said, up that road, and she said, just turn to the right and there we are, see."
"she said, may i come with you."
"i said, ."
"i said it will be nice company and so she said er, you sit near the window, i've seen it lots of times before as i only live in manchester so she well the two of us went together."
well we went off and got off at peel which was the other  with the  all bandaged up and she said the chemist advised me to go to the police and er so she said that's why i've been a long time because i've been to the police and reported it.
"he said it's happened before and he advised her to go to the police and er so he, he said er when and the police told her, when you come back we'll have all this typed out and she came back all with a flask  all bandaged up and she said the chemist advised me to go to the police and er so she said that's why i've been a long time, because i've been to the police and reported it."
"he said, it's happened before and he advised her to go to the police and er so he, he said er when and the police told her when you come back we'll have all this typed out, your statement but we'll need you to sign  so tell the coach driver to stay at, stop at the police station for you to sign it and i, i said to her, how, how did you manage to stop that boy?"
"oh well, she said, you see, it's my work, she said i work in a, in an insurance office and she said i'm in and out the courts all the time, you see  so  he knocked down the wrong person."
yes.
yes.
"well  anyway  er, you see and well anyway er so when, that night and we were  by coach bus, went there by bus and night she said to me, what are you doing when, in the bus, she said, what are you doing this evening?"
well i said i think i'll go to the theatre and off i went to the theatre.
"i was rather late back,when i got back i heard a knock on my bedroom door and she said it's miss  and er i said, oh come in, i undid the door and she came in and er and so she said to me er, i just had a telephone message from peel er to say that you have been subpoenaed to go the police court next thursday and i said what a day my holiday and she said, well i'm sorry but you'll have to go."
yes.
"so the two of us went off to peel and er anyway they paid us, they paid for our lunch and er and so that was alright and i had to go in the witness box, you see and swear on the bible, you know, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, you see."
"i was a witness you see and down below  and the sergeant said to me, the sergeant came up and said to me, you'll have to be careful because he said that boy, he was sitting there with his mother, poor woman, all in black and er the the boy's employer had got a solicitor on his behalf, you see, and i said well i can only speak through and say what happened, that's all i can do and er, so when i went into the witness box this man came and er asked me all sorts of questions."
"where, why didn't you walk on the pavement, on the path."
"i said there wasn't one, you see and er he said, er so you were walking, were you arm in arm?"
"i said, certainly not."
"so he said, are you two friends?"
"i said, no, we're not friends but we're friendly if you know what i mean."
"we're staying at the same hotel and sharing the same table, you see."
"he said, oh."
so erm then er oh he asked me other questions.
"so he said, you were on the right and this lady was on the left near the gutter side?"
"i said, that's right it's and there was a narrow road, yes."
"so he said erm, well in that case, he said erm, you were walking together but not arm in arm?"
"yes, that's right."
so what else did he ask me?
"oh i know, he said erm, let me see, oh he says, er like that, if it was a narrow road er you er pretty well covered the road and i looked, i said, covered the road, i said i know i'm big, but not that big and everybody, the magistrates on the bench and everybody laughed, you see and there were newspaper reporters sitting down there writing all this down, you see  and so i said to the  sergeant, i said, would you be kind enough to send me a newspaper to er tonight and he to i am not sure if i can  oh yes i think i did."
i suppose i've still got it somewhere.
"anyway, i  over it and er so he, he, he said, yes i will, i'll send a piece  you  ."
"yes i can see them now, they all laughed you see."
oh dear.
"hello!stranger, what can we do for you today?"

"no it's, it's not."

"mhm, yeah, it would fit."
"but i wasn't eating or anything, i mean."
"no, wouldn't have changed anything at that time."

"well, i've had phlebitis in it."
i'm not very good at giving blood.

what i have to do is find a good bit.
i hope you're good at this doctor .
"no, i'm not."

"you're mean, aren't you?"
"aye, i'm afraid so."
the hospital.

"very painful i know, but that was the last time."
"let's see the back of your hand, let's see if."
and i've had .
"there's another  another vein sometimes, in here."
".it's not everybody that has one there, but you certainly do."
er   stick your arm in there.

i see the difference in you under there.
mm.
"and your, your whole face is puffed, but mostly round about there."
"and that, your tiredness all the time,."

that's very very like what happens with the thyroid.
when that starts to slow down.
"and if it is, there's no great problem with that, that's very straightforward, we can get that put right for you."
"now, don't change your diet."
mhm.

"don't go buying anything at the chemist to try and lose weight, cos they won't work."

okay ann?
.
thanks.
right.
okay now.
cheerio.
cheerio just now.
it's very much worth it d'ya know.
i think television would be as much to blame as any you know the bairns the children's programmes are all in english you can.
it amazes me i hear orkney children  in orkney and they'll be playing and talking to in english you know.
they'll be exclamations and things they're just exclamations that they've heard i think on television.
yes i know that with mine it was american.
they used all these americanisms because a lot of the problems were american.
yes.
and they used to when they would speak orcadian among their their pals and then when they when they were playing games all the kids the orcadian ones whether they were orcadian or not would adopt this american drawl and they all spoke like that .
yes maybe play acting when they're doing that they're more conscious of the way they're speaking and they probably want to make it right with what they think it should be.
and as i say i don't know what sort of things children watch on t v but it's all in english.
did you find at school that your dialect was hammered?
yes.
er when i was young erm you know you didn't have to use dialect .
er we got leave to use it in the playground as far as i can imagine but we made an awful division or if we didn't  it pretty quickly in the class.
i can't remember which teacher it was referred to anything orcadian we used as orkneyisms.
and if you were used orkneyisms you were a very poor scholar indeed.
i remember a wee boy in the class i was in in the primary school and he got a row he i remember him getting a row from the teacher and he the teacher said what did you do wrong and he said oh i've gone and putten putten where i should've putten put.
yes.
what was putten was that was that east mainland?
no that's that's west mainland too.
putten and while am i putten nothing.
a putten something somewhere.
yes.
put it somewhere.
yes and we'd never use put.
are there a lot of differences between the the east and the west mainland?
er quite i think maybe.
most would you know be intonation and pronunciation.
to anybody who's used to listening to dialect the east and the west are very different.
all the parishes used to be different and it used to be possible at one time to know approximately where in orkney somebody came from.
and this is still the case with older folk.
many of the older folk if you get them really going in their own dialect you can just say roughly where they come from.
one of the common differences between east and west is the words like table and table in west we'd say table and east they'd say table.
and the west comes appeal and the west's heard becomes a heard and the one sort of difference that's still there and it may take quite while to go is that the east mainland when they're saying a sentence they tend to go up at the end of the sentence the voice rises.
whereas the west mainland never goes really up at the end of the sentence or not to the same extent.
i can't make the east mainland very well.
"i would like to go to the  town today , and she's awfully she's no   the day  and they tend to go up at the end."
and there's other wee things too.
something that the east mainland folk find awfully funny is the west mainland call potatoes .
we don't go out to gather potatoes we go to hunt taters and the east mainland don't say that they would call them more tatties or taties.
i thought taties was north isles.
that's verging on north isles right enough.
well westray maybe has as distinctive a dialect as any north ronaldsay .
north ronaldsay is in a class by it's own and easily recognizable.
but er i believe that at one time people from the islands settled in some of the farms for the east mainland whether there's a similarity in the matter of table or heard and all these sort of things.
there is a similarity creeps in there whether that came with  islands or whether it was there before i just don't know.
because they table and heat table and .
yes.
it sound far more proper in the west mainland then.
well you could say that and yet we're awfully broad.
i would say in just a general accent the way we talk you know.
birsay folk are always considered very broad and so are the harray folk.
maybe more so than say sandwick and i find like rendal folk you could tell some of them even yet.
i always think they have a very nasal pronunciation.
they seem to talk quite a lot up high in in their nasal passages.
and evie well evie's great for sort of exclamations you know.
they're great for  that sort of thing.
and  that's a good old orkney word too.
just as an exclamation and evie folk would take it into their conversation i think even yet the older ones of them.
i've got a granny who comes from the south isles and she says  and that's .
"if you say something and she's surprised she'll say, oh ."
yes.
that's a thing i find that we're losing very much is all these exclamations and a lot of exclamations were calling on a divine hand of god to look after you.
"i mean there's a whole range of exclamations that, bless me, or bless me as we would say."
and god  and mercy me that was just have mercy on me.
"and mine matey and bess be about me that was quite a long exclamation but it was something surprise them terribly, oh bess be about me, just , oh god come to me help, sort of thing."
"and the blessings on me, that was the thing that for anybody who helped them."
"it wasn't, oh thank you very much i'm much obliged or anything like that."
"it was, be blessings on thee, i mean and may god bless you for the help you've given me."
and  that's a common enough one yet.
"granny she says, my ."
yes.
was a a very common one too.
you see you don't hear them any more.
oh  yes.
what was that supposed to mean?
was it just.
oh just the same thing.
just an exclamation.
and.
i think  would be more scottish.
was it  bairns.
oh  yes  bairns.
i i could not say it wasn't fairly common too but no maybe  yes  is a good one.
doing dialect there's still a  things like the wireless and the weather things like that sometimes give it a personality as a .
my mother when she wanted anybody to turn off the wireless used to say  .
much to the amusement of two american girls who stayed with us because they didn't know what this phrase was i mean they couldn't have sort it out in the first place of what it meant.
when they had sort it out they just didn't know but  they would go you know prancing around saying to saying  then .
"a lot of orkney a lot of, i'm going to sneeze now, a lot of orkney men use the word, she,."
mhm.
when they're referring to the tractor or the horse or the car.
mhm.
is that an orkney way of doing it or is that just a sort of male thing?
erm i've never really thought about it i think it's a male thing probably isn't it?
i think maybe english men would refer to their car as she or so on if they get to think you know they make things have personalities you start to give them personal pronoun there.
or their boat you know boy she's.
yes.
boy she's no running right.
that's right.
the tractor's a she right enough very often.
"and there's another sort of things we don't hear is when you sit down at the table to eat erm they're probably the most the hostess would say now would be, help yourself."
"but er there was a whole range of things like,put in the hand and  and erm  they thought you weren't eating plenty or told to  and  supper."
yes  that's just an orkney way of saying fall too.
yes.
and put in the hand just literally put your hand in and get something to eat.
cos it makes for a lot of  you know if you don't have  and say well i'm not going to put in my feet anyway.
"yeah another thing that that old folk use i know that my granny used to say she'll say she'll turn things round she'll say, i'm having nothing with it to do, , i'm no having anything to do with it."
is that common?
yes it's fairly common among older folk still.
"we tend to move the sentences around more and they lines  you know, do you know where my shovel is,where my shovel is and erm, who's  the day, asking how are you."
"that's from shetland, who's  the day."
"i know  who's  the day, yes just a similar similar phrasing."
the thou and the thee and the thines.
you've just said thou who's thou the day.
there are a lot of old folks still use that?
oh yes it's quite common and common in middle aged folk even yet among people you're familiar with.
i mean i was small you wouldn't use thee and thou to an older person.
it was somehow thought of as being irreverent but to members of your own family and people your own age or somebody younger than you you would use thee and thou.
but if it was perhaps even a little one your own age if you didn't know them very well it would be you.
thee and thou were a term implied intimacy and affection and closeness the thee and thou as far as i always understood it.
and another sort of very close phrase that  disappeared is  is a phrase awfully much used.
orcadian dialect it's often said has no words of endearment no dears or darlings but i think  perhaps came as it as any word.
it was said to small children and maybe a young man would say it to his lass but  always implied affection of something young and tender.
yes i'd forgotten that.
yes.
you said about west mainland folk.
well well just the different words it's really a matter of pronunciation.
"like in harray we would say, up to go up and er the deerness folk then would say, up or something like that, up."
and erm.
it's just to go up.
up yes mhm.
"up and up and er in harray we'd say, wee that's just for us you know, we."
"and i think the deerness folk say,wey and we would call a young heifer a ."
whereas the deerness people would call it a .
just very similar the difference is there in the pronunciation.
but a completely different word would be the word for what's behind the cattle in the west mainland it's a  and in the east mainland it's an  or an .
i think that varies too from parishes to islands.
there is this just this slight difference in in the words.
i think i'm really sorry now is to see all the old words really going.
i don't think they'll be any left once the generation who were born before the war see are gone.
but we still have the dialect and the sort of tone of it and and phrasing of it but so much of the old vocabulary is just disappearing altogether.
i sometimes find myself using them yet long years you know when i thought i'd forgotten them and any younger person just looks at me in amazement and has no idea what i'm talking about.
yes i remember my granny coming out with the word.
mhm.
and i hadn't a clue what that was.
"called a lot of things it was a fright or a flapping around or a haste or a, what did what did granny."
"mm, we don't get enough  she said."
yeah that's right aha.
well i went into the shop in harray very short ago.
i used to go to orkney for  to go and asked for some cardboard boxes only we call them pasteboard boxes.
and when the girl came with them i says i think i'll take them all if you can  them.
and she looked at me and blinked her eyes i says you  what  means.
no she said.
"and i says well it is two different meanings the one i'm using is just if you can spare it, if you can  it."
and a  is also what they used to get when you wanted to make mealy puddings you made them with the  the intestines of an animal and that's also called a .
well that's two that's a word with two meanings that's now just completely use more or less.
i haven't heard of that one either.
mhm.
oh you wouldn't   .
no.
yep.
something i did think of when you mentioned about the the cattle dung that the word that we remember was .
ah yes .
well it can be inside but it's really outside and rotted.
"rotted wet cattle dung, it's no fresh cattle dung's never ."
it's when you get this black really stinking rotten hole that you call it .
and that's what came the  was the .
that's right.
what seeped the  and mixed with some air from there would have been a little dung in it to  it stood half the summer and got to be really high.
that was .
and heaven help you if you fell in the .
yes that's how i remember  it   .
.
i did.
yeah there's there's there's a whole lot of others that were in me head that i i meant to write down before you came in.
mhm.
oh you know it's .
there's erm.
it's just that i like it you know .
yeah.
mhm.
"they understand that there's this also the erm  you know er  said to me, oh it's just english said differently."
i said well no really there's the whole vocabulary .
which is the vocabulary is disappearing first and then i think maybe the actual intonations and phrases will disappear then too.
but it'll take quite a long time for them to go though.
but i do think the vocabulary will be lost very shortly now.
something that i noticed is in the towns like kirkwall and stromness there's a kind of slovenly way of speaking orcadian where they go  butter water .
yes that's very much kirkwall i would say particularly.
there is a slight difference between kirkwall and so kirkwall's another place you the accent of a native born kirkwallian unless you say the   butter and water  and things like that.
and stromness accents no quite so easily picked out as kirkwall but you know that they're from one of the two towns anyway usually.
i don't know if it's progressed into the villages.
i haven't noticed.
no that's very much well very much kirkwall i would say.
has kirkwall always been like that then?
yes.
oh yes.
i wondered about that.
yeah i suppose in the country too there kirkwall would have been the first kirkwall or stromness probably kirkwall would have been the first place where the accents would have been going to go.
i would think so and the particularly the folk living in the towns consciously tended to use less orcadian you know they they'd more dealings with folk from outside the islands for one thing and folk come on in off ships .
and part of the reason the dialect is gone is that we unconsciously translate what we're going to say into good english we're understood.
because there are so many english folk now in every community and we do tend to doctor up the language you know when we talk to them.
otherwise they just wouldn't understand us.
and some places that erm i know that in some places they have their own local way of speaking and then they speak a different way to other folk.
but then they lapse back into the local way of speaking when they're on their own.
but they don't seem to do that here.
er not in kirkwall you mean?
yeah they they don't seem to like i i know that in wick a lot of the folk in wick have have two they've got their own dialect and they've got english.
and in fact in some of the schools  was here i know that mrs flaws erm from wyre her idea at the school was to make orcadian children bilingual.
mhm.
and that they would have the the language that they spoke at home and the language that they spoke at school.
and that they found it easier when they that that english was english and orcadian was orcadian.
yes.
yes i see what you mean probably thought wick's a strange dialect to you they relax it some more  too.
you see  it's really what happens to the older folk like me.
i never talk to anybody as i'm talking now even.
er to me friends  you know.
no it's a it's a totally different when.
it's a.
you're relax you speak in a totally different way.
yes totally different way.
aha.
do you find that the school used to make you very inhibited about the way you spoke?
oh yes when i went to stronsay academy first we were very much kids for the country being all this country ones and often we'd sometimes be  and said some terribly wild and woolly awfully countrified phrase you know until pride came to our rescue when we we got it as much as ever we could.
the orkney word for what we were doing is chanting.
you know that if you chant .
chanting's when you're talking to other orcadians in your best english when there's really no need for it when you just want to show off that you're.
here ago you see it implied that you were so much more learned and knowledgeable and clever if you could talk english.
and if you spoke english to a fellow orcadian you were chanting.
which was their sort of way of making fun of you because you were showing off which is what a native orcadian thinks any of his contemporaries talking in english to anyone an english person.
they they're showing off.
or did do mind you i i wouldn't think it now not for younger folk that's not the case but for the older folk it very much worse.
do you think they're being slapped down over dialect?
erm i must have gonna put yeah  do you think they're being slapped down over dialect at school?
made orcadians very reluctant to speak up ?
oh certainly.
in fact you couldn't adequately express yourself in english you were just better to shut up.
do you think that's still predominant?
oh no no.
i think young folk now are much more ready to express themselves and express themselves .
we were erm not given many opportunities to do that only through things well local clubs like the w r i and which er and in that way all orcadians just trying to do our best together you know.
and the young farmers' clubs were quite good for they encouraged speech making and how to express yourself lucidly and er how to speak nicely.
that was quite good.
but you see there was always this thought that it was always to better yourself that you were doing this that your orcadian was just for home about and among yourselves and what it didn't really matter.
but if you really wanted to make an impression you had to get rid of this orcadian fast.
for for visitors coming to orkney do you think it that there's a happy medium?come to orkney.
is there a way of talking in your natural dialect that they can understand you and yet without losing it?
i don't really think there is.
i know some folk won't change for anybody they just go harping on in their dialect and er well this fellow said some visitors just don't understand him i always find myself translating in a situation like that.
they can't even pick up just the words that are english words only pronounced in the orcadian way.
like i'm.
i'm gone to the shop.
well just the intonation and the and the way you would say that they they can't pick it up.
the shetlanders don't seem to do that to the same extent they don't seem to change their dialect.
no they're they're much better at keeping it and they seem to manage quite well too.
and yet doesn't shetland doesn't seem so difficult to maybe it's because we're orcadian but shetland doesn't seem to be so difficult to understand for somebody outside than orcadian is i wonder why?
i think that's maybe because we're orcadian for good we're feeling if we go you know that yourself if you go south anywhere and you meet up with just anybody that's ever heard an orcadian.
well my you come from orkney.
"you think that's especially true and like say aberdeen if you go in a shop there and and, it used to be the case, and asked for something you be thought you were speaking fine but they would just say, oh my you down from orkney for a holiday?"
you know right away picked you up right away.
did folk often used to accuse you of being welsh?
quite frequently welsh and once  german .
yes i often used to be accused of being welsh but it is different.
it's different but erm if you really get an orkney talker just talking to and er drawing out the words sometimes it can get to be the same lilt as welsh.
and probably to a you know to an untutored ear it would sound reasonably similar.
"i'm, i'm in before the doctor!"
.
aye.
thought they'd lost you there.
"well now, what can i do for you tonight?"
er it's an insurance line doctor.
just to keep me.
right.
it's my thumb.
"that's the excuse i've been giving, and."
mhm.
that's the one i'm sticking to.
how're things doing?
"alex has not been too well the last couple of days, you know."
yeah.
doctor was in this morning.
mm.
"er  but i, as i say, there's nothing  that anybody can do really."
"no, it's."
you know?
just a matter of time.
"i meant to phone up this morning for an appointment for doctor , but i forgot all about it."
"i really did, she was  the nurse came in, first it was  the doctor,."
mhm.
"then it was the priest, then it was another nurse, then the priest and she was getting."
"agitated, everybody coming in to see everybody."
she'll be up the pole.
aye.
"agitated, you know."
"oh, i wish they'd all bloody leave me alone."
"say something like that, oh no."
och aye.
och aye.
"you must, i mean she."
she's no more medicine left.
she's no medicine left?
"no, not the stuff that you gave her anyway."
right.
"that's  and she knows, she knows perfectly well what's  what's happening."
i mean she's not stupid.
och aye.
do you really think so doctor?
she's not stupid.
"i mean she's lived long enough, she's seen it all."
aye..
she's seen it all before.
"and they, they get very very quickly suspicious when, you know, when the nurse is coming in and the priest's coming in and the."
doctor's coming in.
they're not so daft.
"we don't, we don't give them much credit."
"no, well."
but they're not  they're not so stupid.
"well, the doctor mentioned hospital, she was awfully upset."
who who mentioned the hospital?
the doctor.
did he?
"actually, she had mentioned it herself first."
mhm.
"she said, er er no, i think it was the doctor actually mentioned hospital."
"i see you've been to the hospital, or something like that."
you know?
mhm.
with the records.
aye.
"oh, i'm not going back, i'm not going back there ."
after that she was awfully upset.
"so i mean that day we had to tell a lot of lies, you know, like that."
oh.
"no, the doctor just meant that er you were at the hospital,."
that's right.
you've not to go back yet.
"oh,just wait till it comes and see what happens."
"aye, just."
"the doctor said something about a tube in her to stop the, to stop what was it now, the doctor said there's a tube, they put a tube in her  and they don't."
try and ease the swallowing?
"aye, it's something about the jaundice."
"and it, it would ease the jaundice ."
aye.
"it's  it won't, it won't er."
"no, he says it's."
it won't stay like that.
no.
it won't stay like that.
"what, what they did was they took er  on, on the inside, there's er  there's the liver, in there er just at the end of the stomach."
"and what they did was they put a tube from here into the next bit of the stomach, that comes round from underneath there, put a tube across there."
"ah, right."
so they didn't have to go through this bit.
aha.
because that bit's all  full.
"right, right."
you know?
so they put a tube across there.
"so the stuff coming down, goes through there and then it goes into the rest of the tubes, and away through."
"but that will last for  a certain length of time,."
aha.
until this grows  down past that bit.
or up over the top of that bit.
"ah, i see."
or it pushes the tube shape.
aha.
aha.
sometimes bends the tube round about.
aye.
"but  i mean it might take another two weeks, it might take another two months."
you can never tell.
but.
aye.
right.
aha.
aha.
"i mean she'll just gradually, because this bit between here and the stomach is the bit that most of the food gets digested in,."
aye.
"she'll not have much of an appetite, because that bit's not working properly, and it's not getting a chance to go through her."
"well james , what can i do for you tonight?"
it's  my knee again.
your knee?
still giving you trouble jim?
aye.
"that's a boy, let's have a wee look at it."
see how we're doing.
"did you get x-rays, jim?"
"aye, for  and i still didn't, they didn't show anything."
there's no arthritis or anything?
good.
that's good.
no there's no  that other thing  the inhaler thing.
mm.
no sign of any damage with that.
"now then, where, where are you feeling it catching just now?"
here and.
still round there.
"this  up here, and, and there's kind of er shooting pains  and."
"still puffy down here, isn't it, eh?"
that bit doesn't feel so bad.
mm.
remember there was we we thought there.
"aye, a."
was a wee.
scar.
scar across there.
you can still feel a slight  have you been doing your exercises?
no?
right.
"well, i think you're at the stage now where we could get you doing your exercises, jim."
"it's at, you can feel the slight  in there."
ah.
"just there , you can feel that, feel that, feel it catching."
but that's softer than it was before.
so that's good.
"now, what we'll need to get you doing, is some exercise to strengthen up the muscle across there."
and pull that scar  tight together jim.
"what, what i want you to do is, just with you sitting just now, just lift your leg up like that, just hold it with your two hands."
and just  do that.
about twenty times a day.
"now your knee'll be sore, when you start doing it, because you, this muscle has to get strengthened up again."
and let that scar get joined up.
"but as you keep doing that, every day, it'll get less and less and less painful."
"and after about a week, there'll be no pain in it, and you'll be  doing it no bother ."
"and that muscle'll grow over the top of that scar, and it'll get rid of all that for you jim."
okay.
"well that's so as you're, you're going to win after all."
you're going to win.
"er, what about the inhalers now, are you still?"
er could i  erm have a prescription for ?
"aye, sure."
i'm still on the  forty.
the you still on that?
do you need them?
"no, that's just."
"no, you're all."
it's just i don't have any ventolin.
right.
"now then, if you do these wee exercises jim and then come back up and see me in  about  say four weeks."
let's say four weeks.
okay.
"and we'll just check that out again, and make sure that that's all got healed over."
you're at number two?
"yes  number two   you haven't gone and left home since i saw you last, no?"
no.
you're still at ?
"but that's good, i'm  pleased."
"that's   well, that's since january."
aye.
it's been really slow.
"cos yeah, er, it er it does worry you."
"and er if we can get it to just, well a wee bit of rest, we get to the stage where it er starts to get soft again."
it means we can get the muscle to  grow over the top and bury that underneath and let the whole thing get back to normal.
okay.
but just nice gentle exercises.
no leaping up and down .
eh?
okay?
yeah.
just do it nice and gently and that'll come back to normal.
right thanks doctor.
okay.
thanks.
right.
bye.
okay john cheerio now.
hello.
hello.
"well, what can i do for this  day?"
see if you could give me some   doctor.
to it.
no it's the tablets and that i'm  .
were you still waiting for that now?
right?
mm.
that's.
healed.
really.
bad.
and weeping.
i can't walk.
right.
well that's needing healed up again.
aye.
right.
but i admit  matter.
you still on  ?
.
mhm.
okay .
alright.
"now, i've given you some cream to put on  anne."
right.
"now, put that on three times a day and you put the tablets, you take the tablets four times a day."
what the tablets for?
it's an antibiotic stuff to clean it from the inside.
ah right.
because there's inflammation round about the inside of the pin.
it's that that's  weep.
"and it's starting to come out, aye."
it's starting to come out.
mm.
onto the skin.
and trouble you.
do you?
yes.
oh aye.
i am.
oh aye.
mm.
oh aye.
more or less.
"see  doctor , see my toes?"
"i've seen them going kind of black, you know?"
yes.
that's.
okay.
is that alright?
don't don't worry about that.
i     maybe.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
you've no  you're not going.
to come to any harm with that .
see these  tablets you gave me?
they're no use.
i prefer to keep.
are they not?
with the .
mhm.
that i've got.
right.
because you gave me ten milligrams and the five's not very strong.
but i'm not very well with them and i just think they're terrible.
save on the .
right.
"but er if you haven't heard, how long have the pins been in now, anne?"
two year.
a year and a half.
"if you haven't heard within the next two or three months, come in and see."
mhm.
again and we'll get onto the.
mm.
hospital because that's.
"i know, i mean i've  skin,."
aye.
but er twice  so i didn't get .
right.
"and then i, i was at doctor  's but he er he hasn't sent me a letter ."
right.
because he can't.
doing it.
.
it seems.
it seems quite a long time.
"and er at times, at spells, i've got to put on the pink bandage, at times, you know, to get the swelling back down."
right.
aye.
sounds the pins are needing to come out.
oh aye.
definitely need to .
even the nurse said she could see it.
"oh, well."
hmm hmm.
aye.
right.
er that's the  strength or possibly three or .
right well.
we'll get.
right.
"that, we'll get that organized for you."
thanks.
okay?
very much.
right?
cheerio.
cheerio now.
a letter to mr  at the  surgeon at  district hospital.
about anne  of  .
dear mr .
you may have already  saying that mrs   attended  recently.
she has a black  and she asking about .
turned septic.
she's quite worried  crusting and discharge but she's having .
in fact  been  treatment with antibiotics and  cream .
"however, she ."
i feel that she would.
so doesn't matter.
"yeah you've met, have, am i the last?"
well i wouldn't say you're the last.
but i have actually seen all of the others.
right.
"erm i've seen deborah, ray and cynthia."
erm so yes in a sense.
right.
erm the discussions have been interesting.
what i did was prepare a supplementary form to the one that we had at the management team meeting.
right.
"which lists the activities erm that we'd referred to before, on the original note."
yeah.
and adds a few.
and i have with each of the other discussions added other.
yes.
points.
yeah.
"so i've got a number, i mean i started with, had had about fifteen, we've now got about ninety six."
ooh!
erm they'll probably all common off quite .
yeah.
all i'm gonna do after this is reproduce the list with all of the points that each person has agreed.
"i'm not saying to you or any of the others, no i don't agree with that as a, that's for our debate later."
right.
this is the list.
and i'll look and see what ways we can collect the data erm to provide the er the intelligence if you like.
right.
and then we'll have the debate.
but at the.
right.
moment it looks to me if we do a spreadsheet it'll be something like eight foot six.
long .
but we'll only really worry about the last page if you.
mm.
"like, the last three or four columns."
"but as you say it may well be that erm we can look at it and say well really that factor compensates for that one,."
yes.
in which case we can disregard because it.
yeah.
but obviously that'll take a little bit of time through discussion won't it?
"yes it will, yeah."
"i'm not sure how happy we will be able to that but we don't, we obviously have to try."
mm.
erm now.
"what i'd like to do,."
yeah.
"is i'll just run through the additional points and these on the list which have been raised by the others, and."
right.
"if you want to comment on any of those while we're going through, or perhaps cross them off your list."
and then we'll go through your list.
so you'll know what the others have already said.
okay.
and then you can present yours.
erm.
well i wouldn't er i don't expect most things will  completely  but anyway we'll see.
yeah.
"yeah, probably yes."
er i mean i've  the number of part time centres.
do you want this back?
no you can comment on that.
"no right, okay."
if you would sue.
and then just put  on the top.
"erm number of part time centres, half day sessions,."
yeah.
the uniform agreement is that they should be graded up point seven five of a day.
"yes, fair comment."
which seems to me perfectly fair.
yeah.
and to be honest i wouldn't have argued if anyone had said whole day.
yeah.
you know cos it.
yeah.
it varies .
erm  the number of further education colleges in the division.
mhm.
would include satellites  like erm.
northallerton.
askham bryan.
right.
"in the south,."
right.
yeah?
yeah.
in the north it would include northallerton grammar school and the y c a p annexe.
yeah.
"erm and i mean perhaps bedale agricultural, but i mean that, that's."
mhm.
erm they had a number of f e students seen in the last year.
yeah?
that's full time and part time.
right.
age seventeen to nineteen.
do you want me to comment on that as we go through or.
no if you.
right you're just explaining it to me?
you could  if want to.
yeah.
if you want to add things then we can yeah.
"okay and then we'll, we'll go back it okay."
"erm the number of full f f e students seventeen to nineteen erm full time and part time erm, there are."
mm.
in a division.
yeah.
yeah?
"so that's you know greater percentages than those you've actually seen, that's hundred percent and what you've seen is whatever it is."
right so you.
yeah.
that's actually an additional one that you've put in?
yeah.
yeah.
cos you'd raised that point.
yeah.
yeah.
"erm the number of sixth form colleges in a division, as a separate institution."
right.
yeah.
i mean not everybody's got them.
number of sixth form students erm seen in the last year.
yeah?
yeah.
"i've got a scribble behind it, oh annual report i'd get that from."
right.
and the total number of sixth form students in a division.
sixth form students in a division.
right.
number of special schools in a division.
mhm.
"and the number of special schools' students and pupils, pupils seen, in years ten upwards."
yeah?
right.
"i'm not saying, in here, we also want a column of the total number of special needs."
no.
"pupils, cos we see them all."
i mean if we don't we only gonna miss one or two.
"yeah, this is a complicated one isn't it?"
yeah.
yeah.
"now these, this next band, the annual mileage ones, the sickness, and the form seven projections for the next three years, that data will come from alan."
yeah.
yeah.
erm and this is going to be the area of horse trading i think.
yeah.
"er i mean your point about how, how much time is spent in travelling a small number of miles in york."
mm mm.
"ray made the same argument for scarborough, because."
mm.
says the whole of the  eastern division because it's all a and it's.
yeah.
got the longest season etcetera.
this where.
mm mm mm.
we're going to get some debate.
mm.
erm and.
well how.
mm?
"has the sickness come about keith, because i mean."
"well because if, if we got, if we say you've got a certain number of members of staff, and each full time equivalent offers you two hundred and twenty two point eight working days a year."
mm.
well if the sickness rate in one division.
mm.
is significantly higher.
mm.
"than it is in another,."
morale is presumably lower.
"well there may, well yes possibly, or they may have a much higher morale because they've got a much more benevolent  management style ."
"yes, and have more days off."
"yes, yeah ."
"i mean it came about because, and i won't name names, one member of staff has had an astonishing amount of time."
mm.
off sick.
and in some organizations they would not be working for us any more.
mm.
or they'd have been in a different position.
yeah.
where sickness wasn't a such a crucial issue.
mm.
"erm and i mean i've had a recent bereavement, i mean i, i lost my mum at christmas and got three days leave."
mm.
this person's had to  three and a half weeks.
mm.
"and not from bereavement but the, the consequence of the traumatic shock of their eighty eight year old father passing away."
mm.
erm it's not fair on that division.
no.
so if we notice.
ah.
significant.
"right okay, i mean it."
differences.
"erm it's a case of whether i, i would've expected that, that an analysis of that over a significant period of time would even out, really."
"it might, but if say we said over a year, and we said there're a total number of fifteen members of staff,."
mm.
yeah?
and the average time off fifteen members of staff is fifteen times two hundred and twenty two.
mm.
point eight.
what percentage of sickness has that.
mm.
total number got?
"i mean see whether there, the sickness loss as a percentage of your total of staff time is very different in one."
mm.
division to another.
mm.
over year but i mean in theory.
yeah.
you could go back over.
yes.
several years.
but it really is no indication whether that's likely to be the case in the future isn't it?
"no, not as raw data but you then go to use it as intelligence, i e."
mm.
"go back and look at, so like this division was."
mm.
five times more sick leave than any of the others.
yeah.
was it all concentrated in one person?
yeah.
"or all across, if it's all across the, the division then that's a major problem of organization or something."
mm.
"but if it's a single member of staff, it's a, it's only a difficulty isn't it?"
you can.
yeah.
solve it.
yeah.
theoretically tomorrow.
yeah.
but i mean i didn't want to exclude anything anybody's referred.
we'll debate it when we're all together.
and obviously if one person's.
i think it.
got more sick time than another they're.
yeah.
"going to be more keen on that area of debate than, than their colleagues."
yeah.
yeah?
"i, i, i find it illogical."
well.
"i mean i found it almost as ridiculous as trying to say, well half of my clerical staff are fairly incompetent so  i think we should have a sort of incompetency rating for each of."
"yeah, fine but if, yeah but what we've got is hard data for every single member of staff and therefore every group of staff."
yeah.
on sickness rates.
on sickness and we haven't on.
and we haven't got a measure for incompetence but there's.
no.
a reason why we couldn't have is there?
you could.
no.
award everybody on appraisal process.
that's right you could.
a hundred percent is efficient erm.
yeah.
and eighty five percent is less.
yes.
so you could add up all your members of staff and see what your efficiency rating.
yes.
was.
er you know er.
anyway.
i'm i'm interested in making this job  last as long as possible but i don't think i want to go to retirement.
"erm ray raised an interesting point, loading for management time, ray would argue that he spends a disproportionate amount of time travelling to meetings, more than any of the other members."
mm.
of the management team.
yeah?
you might wish to counter that because it takes you longer to go a smaller distance.
well it certainly does.
right the the reason is.
yeah.
"once you include that it, because the more he's the office the more sheila has to cover for him."
mm.
"therefore perhaps her being fifty percent case load, perhaps she."
mm.
should be thirty.
mm.
or whatever.
yeah?
"so it's a drain on, on the time, not just his but the knock-on effect."
ray's also introduced a holiday traffic for the scarborough and the whole division.
mhm.
to counter your busy york.
erm the number of independent schools in a division.
the number of independent schools serviced in a division.
yeah?
yeah.
i mean servicing a school regardless of how many people there are is  no no but it.
"yes so it's not, that's not on here is it?"
right.
will be when i've written.
yes.
them all out.
"erm number of independent pupils, erm aged eleven to eighteen, in a, in a division,."
yeah.
and the numbers seen.
yeah?
yeah.
"erm ray's raised another point, it's about the further education network links that he has to service, the five n y b e c groups he has to service, erm collating work experience on the database."
"now my knowledge of that database is nobody  should be spending any time doing anything with that, cos nobody's ever said it works ."
"erm the number of, work experience there's a, how many schools involved, how many placements do you actually help find or, or whatever."
"how many placement providers are there, that the careers service is actively involved in working with."
it's going to be.
on work experience?
yeah.
right.
because there's a wide variety of schemes operating across the county.
i mean trident is one and that has a certain effect.
"erm i don't know but there may well be activities for the divisional staff outside trident, related to work."
yeah.
experience.
i mean you know trident doesn't do it all.
no there.
so.
"is an impact, it isn't major on me."
"yeah, right, well that's fair enough then, too bad."
and it's the bane  of my life .
yeah.
"i  i can't, i can't understand why we're involved in it in the way we are."
erm.
mm.
y t providers.
yeah.
"erm  y t providers linked to the division, actively ."
yes.
yeah?
so.
yeah.
"they might be the divisional area but you, they might just be for the amount of you're spending on them."
mm.
yeah?
"y t providers associations serviced, the numbers of y, on y t, erm numbers of applications for training per division."
"yes, i'm particularly keen on that one myself."
yeah.
erm yes deborah raised that one particularly erm so this is deborah's list now.
erm how many f e students there are with special needs.
"yes, another one i'm very keen on."
yeah.
"erm a point about the c l, as i e how much time does any, each of the divisions have of c l a time."
yeah?
erm obviously got our eyes on jackie.
erm the ratio of clerical staff to management and the amount of time managers spend on central management activities.
"yeah, so how much time."
hang on.
are you your division.
yeah.
because you're involved in county-wide or national things.
"county-wide things, yeah."
"and also how much clerical time is used up for non consumer activities in a division, like supporting those things you go off to london and."
"right, yes."
brighton and bristol and birmingham.
right yes.
to do.
mm?
yes yeah.
"erm mileage per school, linked to sessions."
erm so how much time are you spending just going to the school?
now we can't get that from alan's data because.
mm.
he hasn't broken down the mileage into how it's assigned.
"but if we get, we, it seemed to me i mean deborah raised it and i think there is a way of doing it, which would be erm looking at the agreements, how many schools have got agreements?"
how many visits are planned in the agreement?
mm.
yeah?
and each visit is a session whether it's a day or half a day or twenty.
mm.
minutes and there's a mileage from the standard mileage list for that.
mm.
"but again it's, it's another one of these things that makes it really complicated."
it does.
"there's a lot more work to get it, we'll have to decide what."
mm.
we want to exclude.
"but yeah, i mean on something like that there's a potential for getting erm benefits bad management ."
you know if you're.
too right.
allowing careers officers to do to call in at schools on a regular basis trying to do.
yeah.
one thing when they're there.
"yeah,what i think it is it's a management control,."
yeah.
"because if one division, we know how many, each if we've got for each division  the number of agreements, the number of sessions, the number of staff we've got three common factors, different numbers obviously."
mm.
"but if the ratio of visits to staff or visits to school is great, really great, significantly different in some."
mm.
"then that actually says to that divisional manager,."
yes.
"you're not, you don't seem to be using your time as efficiently."
yeah.
as others.
not that you're going to get more time because.
no.
of this.
"but you could use it, yes."
yeah.
"i understand, so in other words your research isn't actually going to tell us more than."
"it's more a control than a, a, a gift."
yeah.
it's going to tell us things over and above looking at staffing levels isn't it?
"yeah i understand, yeah."
yeah if we agree that's one of the things we want to include.
"erm, and i think that's it, yeah?"
er cynthia raised erm   .
"yeah that's the numbers linked to the division, erm  cynthia i mean i was only going to be looking at n y c c and c s s s funded staff, yeah?"
yeah.
"because they were the part, they are the structure of the service as it exists ."
yeah.
"cynthia also wants to look at t f e adult, c s f, erm and see how they're distributed."
erm.
mhm.
i'm gonna have to look at how that can be done.
because.
right.
"she argues, not unreasonably, that it does have an effect on the management."
it certainly does.
the e o e particularly.
i mean i have seven erm careers officers working with adults operating from york.
yeah.
and people like murray and adrian are frequently through my door.
yeah.
"and yet i've been, in theory i don't actually manage them."
"that's right, yeah."
plus.
"so i i also think that you know i'm, i'm quite happy to see something like that maybe dealt with in a sense as a separate issue, because it's."
yeah.
very difficult to to assess.
yeah.
but er.
mm.
"it's, is a factor,."
"right, yeah."
yeah.
mm.
"erm and the percentage of part time staff to full time staff, which is one i raised."
yes.
because that has an effect on how you can use people.
erm.
"yeah, i was looking at that myself yesterday actually and er if i include three, three trident staff, erm there are thirty five individuals."
mm.
in york itself.
yeah.
and only seventeen of them are full time.
"yeah, and i don't now but i mean i'm certainly in two i've been since there's people who've referred to the fact that they don't have those members of staff working for them at the optimum days,."
mm.
because people have to come in on meetings so these people.
yeah.
"have booked their working days, they're not the best  in the division."
"i have an answer to that, you don't  have any meetings ."
"well yeah, that's a very good answer to that, yeah, but when, how would you do research?"
yeah.
"erm but that was, that was er points that are raised so far sue,."
right.
"so anything you wish to add erm let's, let's."
okay.
add.
well what i'd quite like to do is if we could go back over.
mm.
that keith.
yeah.
and there were a few things that you mentioned as you were going through that you know i just really want to make a few comments on really.
yeah.
just to make sure that erm.
mhm.
"you're aware of my, my views really."
yeah certainly.
"are you going to write them on, down, or do you want me to?"
"erm, do you want to do it because."
"i don't really mind,okay and then we agree what we've said."
"the, you've got, yeah if we and we both jot down what we've."
yeah.
then if you've got a record of what everybody's said.
mm.
"in the list that you sent out, in fact that one there,."
yes.
"that does mention, cos i saw there were sessions at part time centres you know."
mm.
that's fine.
erm number of careers centre operated is significant for deborah and i.
"we've, if we're talking division we've got two full time centres obviously."
yeah.
so.
"ah, i mean yes you've only got one centre."
yeah.
"at york, but you've got two centres in two you've got three centres in the division."
yes that's right yeah.
yeah and deborah's got four.
yeah.
yeah.
erm that's an area where the divisions are not identical.
yeah.
yeah?
and it has an effect.
mm.
"if york had erm five percent greater number of educational institutions, there's still the same number of young people."
mm.
that would have an effect.
"have an impact, that's right."
yeah.
"what did occur to me though was, if you were looking half day sessions,."
mm.
"you could actually talk about, right a full time centre is ten half day sessions, two full time centre equals twenty half day sessions."
yeah.
and you could actually come up with an equitable total.
yeah.
contact time of careers.
yeah.
centre opening couldn't you?
if you used that sort of an equation.
"because there is a, obviously tadcaster is the only part time office."
it's only open you know a half day a week.
yeah.
"but throughout the summer, now i, i ought to find out for you exactly how much time in total this does accrue, but we go to sherburn library once a fortnight throughout the summer."
"yeah, that's fine."
erm that's legitimate to include that.
"erm so i, i need to."
yeah.
i'm quite happy to put the number of full time centres' weekly sessions.
yeah.
"and then what we would simply say is that, i mean a day is one point zero."
mm.
erm and a half day in another location is point seven five.
point seven five.
yeah.
"erm but i just don't, i'm not going to."
"yeah, yeah."
"argue i mean there's no, it's not for any one of us."
"to, to come up."
no.
"with the final list, unless that one person is paul or alan."
yeah.
yeah.
"that's fair enough, yeah."
but i accept the point fully and  that you should include any.
now.
that you do.
how are you going to cope with er selby or how are we gonna cope with selby college.
it's the only tertiary college.
erm now.
right okay.
obviously we can't count it twice it's only one institution.
yeah.
"so we either, number of institutions i would think we probably count it as an f e institution, because this the a level is, is much smaller than the other f e. but f e students and sixth form students, what i would want to do is count the a level students as sixth form students."
yes.
yeah?
yeah.
and the so i'm not sure.
count all a level students as sixteen to nineteen.
yeah.
year olds.
"because the percentage of adults over that age, presumably doing full time a level courses."
yeah.
is going to be minimal isn't it?
"that's right, yeah."
"yeah, i think so."
"so i must check that the figures i've already given you, that's the way that i've done it."
right.
i'm not quite.
okay.
confident that it is.
yeah.
so.
"i mean i don't mind which institutional type you call it because it's not so much the courses, it's the numbers of people and the numbers of places you have to service."
yeah.
isn't it?
numbers of clients and the numbers of service points.
that's right.
yeah.
"divide er    yeah, i must check that out."
"right the erm i accept that looking at work carried out, which is what we've got in a number of instances, like."
mm.
number of f e students seen.
mm.
erm number of special needs students seen .
if there were a few weren't there?
yes.
we got that.
erm again that's valuable information.
"but there is a major flaw that was pointed out when we had our last discussion about counting that alongside other factors, that you do a certain amount of work dependent on what your current staffing levels are."
"were you to decrease or increase those staffing levels, then obviously that affects the amount of work you can carry out."
"there, there is a productivity rate that you could."
mm.
"try and identify, per member of staff."
but i mean that would obviously be very difficult.
yeah.
to do.
erm.
"yes there are services i know which are doing that, where."
mm.
local managers have got i mean people using the account house or the erm one of the other major new computer systems.
mm.
where individual c s m r returns are entered by individuals.
yeah.
or the admin assistant.
yeah.
and you can actually say that the average number of visits this week was.
yeah.
three hundred and two.
yeah.
you only did five.
yeah.
"what, what do you say you're doing?"
oh i was out at a school a lot.
not this.
yes.
you weren't.
yes that's right.
erm and you can actually then produce a percentage.
"yeah, yeah."
"so i, i, i think that that managing your staff and, and future staffing levels is relevant."
yeah.
"but obviously we've got to be very careful about looking at actual work carried out, bearing in mind that is."
what we're doing now.
yeah.
"all of this , particularly related to how many erm year ten and sixth form and f e students we see, is we're talking about setting a structure from july of this year."
", yeah."
and in less than a year after that the secretary of state may make it clear that our client group is radically changed and moved.
mm mm.
up the age range.
yeah.
yeah?
yeah.
so all we're doing is what we're doing from july until.
yeah.
the new operating year really.
"that's right, yeah."
"the only other thing i'd say, is that the reason we're doing this is because we're facing cuts not."
mm.
not because we're looking at expanding the service.
mm mm.
yeah?
so that's why i would tend to concentrate on what we're doing now.
mm.
what is our work as far as we can prove it today.
mm mm.
which is based on historical data but.
mm mm.
only going back one year.
"but i mean take, , the two the two full time offices in my division."
erm there are differing work practices which i try to erode but it is very difficult.
mm.
because obviously there's.
so you don't agree in the er local accountability  theory then ?
"i, you see york college of further and higher education is vast, it is, it is a very."
yeah.
big college.
yeah.
and our penetration into that client group is fairly small because we're er er er staffing levels yeah.
got a reason yeah yeah.
"we know that we try and make inroads into that it, it would absolutely mushroom."
yeah.
er and you know we've sort of evidence for that.
"now in selby , where i think bill and i have tried to offset the balance a little bit, but in the past they have been better staffed."
"when we lost the i s c o posts, the small."
mm.
office of selby gained a whole post.
yeah.
"it was then really went into the school side, whereas the same effect in york was much more minimal because."
yeah.
spread much further.
yeah.
erm which meant that traditionally selby gave more time to the college.
mm.
in some centres that's justified the sixth form.
yeah.
element of that.
erm but  i know that the true colleges it's a disproportionate service.
yeah.
"erm and that is based on the fact that selby have, were better  staffed ."
yeah.
so they consequently did a lot more work.
right.
in the college you see.
"but the only, the only facts we've got, is a number seen, and the numbers that there are potentially there to be seen."
"mm, yeah."
now i don't know whether we'd be able to get that i mean.
mm.
whether the colleges will be able to say to us we have got.
mm.
three and a half thousand people sixteen to nineteen.
mm.
on any sort of course.
mm.
"i mean if they did, fine."
mm.
i don't think they will uniformly.
i think we should know as a service.
but i don't know what else we could get.
what sort of penetration we should expect to have.
"yeah i, i fully agree."
erm i  don't.
no.
but i think that's something we need to have.
"but if we know how many we're seeing in a, in an age."
mm.
"band, yeah?"
yeah.
and we know how many there are in the age band we can say we're penetrating to a degree of.
"yeah, that's right, yeah."
five percent or thirty percent.
"so we've got all, i don't know what else we could add."
yeah.
at the moment.
no.
i mean is there.
"i, i'm really expanding on exactly what that information tells us, and in what sense, you know there's certain bits of information that analyzed as a set of information, tells us something."
"but it, you can't then put that information together with other information because they're actually telling us different things, if you see what i mean?"
"all of it, yeah."
yeah.
"erm i think, i think they're all telling us different things and they're gonna be yeah."
sort of subsets aren't they really?
and they're gonna be interpreted.
yes.
differently.
i mean this.
yeah.
"is why ideally with the original spreadsheet, we had about five."
yeah.
items.
that's right yeah.
but it's the group that have decided that we'll have eighty five items.
yeah.
"you see i would be quite happy you know through negotiation to say, okay askham bryan college is in my division, i know that there are satellites ."
"and we do offer them a service, but they're a specialist college, everybody."
mm.
there is vocationally.
yeah.
committed if you like.
"and i'd be quite happy to agree er a penetration level there, that was a much smaller percentage than."
yeah.
you would expect in another college.
"yeah, yeah."
.
"that's a debate area that's going to have to come to, yeah."
"so i think that sort of weighting factors are quite important, yeah."
"yeah, yeah."
"i mean it's going to be contentious because i mean erm certainly cynthia, to a smaller extent erm mandy, would argue that whilst you've got york college of further."
mm.
"and higher education, harrogate's got harrogate college of whatever it is now."
mm.
and you know ray's got scarborough.
mm.
"erm numbers of those students whose addresses are in other divisions, are."
mm.
actually being serviced at home in the home office.
mm.
how on earth.
mm.
the only way we're going to get that is the number of f e students seen.
yeah.
erm and i'm i'm happy to include the number that there theoretically are.
yeah.
"and we can make whatever judgments about that we want to, as a group, i won't exclude anything sue."
"yeah, fair enough yeah yeah."
"and you only mentioned that briefly, once, at management team meeting and it was included in all the discussions, you know ray was the first one, you know."
yeah.
"right, so where, right that's the f e sixth form bit, quite happy about that."
erm special needs is a difficult one.
mm.
"but i think that jane particularly will have a view on that, because it isn't strictly a divisional issue."
it is.
no.
"more truly a county issue than some other aspects, and i think that, that should help, help us out quite a lot."
i hope so i mean.
yeah.
"i did some figures last year on  had this, this, this issue about distributing the special needs staff, which wasn't in the."
mm.
m s u had planned it.
mm.
"erm and what, and, and because the decisions were made outside the division, they were made here,."
mm.
we just didn't get any.
mm.
yeah.
it didn't happen.
yeah.
"erm our special needs provision was a erm a scale six member of staff with no prior experience who'd had a ropy  probation year anyway,."
yeah.
you know ?
yeah.
"erm and when i looked at the figures, we had a greater percentage of institutions and pupils than the other sharer or partner in the process."
yeah yeah yeah.
"so i, i am interested in seeing."
yes.
what the numbers say.
yes.
"well i know that my, if i was to name my busiest member of staff, it's the person that took on that."
yeah.
special needs work.
mm.
"and erm i think it's erm an, an issue for us to look at as a management team, whether we actually give it an even, even greater weighting."
yeah.
than we recently have done.
i think that would be very justified.
yeah.
in actual fact.
a lot of the work.
yes it would.
"comes post sixteen,."
yes.
which is why i was pleased that erm.
well it starts a year earlier .
well that's right.
"erm but it's the,in york and in selby, there are very big c p v e groups."
mm.
"who have, have got quite significant special needs."
yeah.
"and it they're hugely time consuming, and that i, i, you know."
mm.
"i was glad that, was it deborah had raised that, because i certainly see that."
yeah.
as a major factor.
yeah yeah yeah.
it is.
erm.
"yeah, i mean."
but again we're not in a growth area.
no no.
you know the government may well have given a priority for special needs.
"yeah if, if we give a higher weighting to special need then we've to take it somewhere else."
you take it from somewhere else yeah.
we're not talking about adding extra staff.
"but i, i do wonder is that might."
and seeing who gets their share.
no but it is an opportunity to actually.
oh yeah.
address that isn't it?
"yes it is,."
mm.
yeah.
"yes i mean, yes i mean."
mm.
"i, i, i."
"which is why i'm disappointed alan is curtailing the discussions at two thirty, on the day that we're meeting to discuss it."
"but anyway, he's optimistic we'll have sorted it by two thirty."
"right well, well we will finish by two thirty then won't we?"
yeah.
"well we'll have to, to, but we've got c s m t the next day anyway."
yeah.
but erm.
yeah.
okay erm yeah again related to special needs it the number of training applications.
yeah yeah.
erm which i think we can assume.
is reasonably standard.
in.
well i mean the arguments i've had is that they're not.
what that in some areas somebody wouldn't get an application whereas that they would in other areas?
yeah.
yeah.
oh no sorry the numbers.
are yeah yeah yeah.
"the numbers are not standard i know, i, i know that we, we have a very high."
yes in theory we should be doing the same thing.
"i, i think most people would feel, we've been doing it for such a while."
mm.
now and.
yeah.
"i think that n y t e c would have said something if none, you know if there was a disproportionate."
yeah.
or a vastly disproportionate er numbers.
yes.
that's right they'd.
erm.
have gone for the lower number wouldn't they?
"definitely so i mean i, i again i'm very."
yeah.
pleased that you're including that one.
yeah.
we are including.
erm.
it.
"what's we're including that one, yeah."
what's this annual sickness rate for c ts and ?
clerk typists.
oh right.
sorry.
sorry i understand i thought it was careers teachers for a minute.
oh no.
"ooh now that's an interesting point, cos how much of a burden then falls to the careers officer?"
we go back to the incompetence argument again.
"erm i accept again form seven projections, that that's obviously you know."
yeah i know we're not in growth.
no but we can't year ahead.
we can't ignore the next year ahead.
yes.
"although there is this, perhaps we won't be dealing with year eleven pupils."
"er well no, but it still might be that year eleven numbers is still our gearbox as paul called it so whether that's actually."
"yeah that's our, that's our ratio yeah."
the group.
yeah.
we're working with or not that might be our funding ratios.
"mm i must admit i'm, i'm be interesting to see the outcome, you know when audit commission and o f s t e d say that thirty percent of people who enter further and higher education fail."
yeah.
why are we concentrating on them?
why aren't we concentrating all our resources before they start?
yeah.
you know?
still.
erm i didn't write down the other things that you mentioned as we were going through that weren't on this list.
right.
so i can't remember if there's anything.
okay so we've got loading for management time.
holiday.
yes.
traffic.
so the management time was times spent the office by divisional managers was it?
"that's ray's definition, yeah."
yeah.
oh.
yeah.
it'd fair comment actually  yeah.
if it can be quantified.
yeah.
yeah.
erm.
"and if it's going to be relevant, from july onwards if paul's talking about moving into different premises,."
yeah.
"it's going to knock an hour off ray's journey if we're in thirsk, if h q is."
yeah.
in thirsk.
yeah.
yeah.
erm and it isn't going to add anything to anybody else about from.
"the problem, we must make sure ray doesn't include the amount of time he extra he needs to arrive at every meeting half an hour early."
well   yeah that's right.
"yes he's not getting, not getting."
you know.
extra two members of staff.
no.
because he's not using his time well.
i mean.
you tell him that.
"i'm not sure whether, you see i think the management time issue is very related to this, but i think it's a separate issue, it's a major concern i've got at the moment that there is, i mean i know everybody's got their own arguments but there has been no time at ever in the future that anybody who goes back further than twenty years in the service can recall, where york has had such a small amount of management time as it's."
mm.
got at the moment.
"and there are a lot of, as far i'm concerned there are a lot of cracks appearing."
erm.
yeah.
and i think you know i'm certainly going to be arguing that we actually address management time almost as a separate issue.
well we haven't grown in the last three years as a service.
mm.
"in the way that we have in previous years and management teams haven't grown in that sense, but the responsibilities of management have been increased."
and we're not doing yet the things that it was planned that we'd be doing of in a year.
we're not financially responsible but we were.
no.
"expecting to be but you know, how, how could you be."
mm.
without any additional i mean.
mm.
"the argument of the lesson of my project is, that without an accounts technician full time here."
mm.
forget it.
mm.
"erm and i suspect much, you know if you're going to be financially down there, unless you want to get involved in double entry bookkeeping because you're transferring money from one fund."
yeah.
"to another, which is what we're supposed to be able to do."
mm.
without a part time temp accounts clerk.
mm mm mm.
forget it.
yes i agree.
yeah.
with you there.
"so i think it'd be, i can see it being a big pitfall if we got into too much of a discussion this, about management time."
mm.
because we could end up spending too much time on that.
but yeah.
"at the expense of actually looking at, at mainline."
yeah.
staffing levels which is what.
"yeah i mean i hope all, i will be able all i will do is say well we've got about fifty bloody criteria here."
yeah.
"erm i'll make up a spreadsheet with twenty five or thirty blank columns, but with all the formulas in place."
yeah.
"and we'll decide which ones we want, and i'll just delete all the remaining empty."
yes.
ones.
do you want the data to go in?
i think we've gotta.
yeah.
until we can meet and agree.
yeah.
some of the all of the data i've i can get i will get.
right.
yeah.
"which is the stuff we've had before, most of which was centrally collected, yeah?"
yes yes.
"erm the everything else is, is, is an area of debate isn't it?"
yeah.
really.
"i mean even the simple things, the hard data like annual mileage, is clearly an area of debate because you and cynthia would argue different points you know."
mm mm.
but what about things like post sixteen special needs?
"the thing about post sixteen special needs is, it's like f e. it doesn't happen where the clients live."
mm.
does it?
no.
"so you know do you get all the credit for it, because it happens in institutions in your division?"
or does somebody else get the credit or does the credit apply equally because everybody deals with their own at home?
mm.
"or do you get a weighting because everybody's dealing with their own, but you're actually dealing with the institution, and."
mm.
probably get some of their work?
i mean.
yeah.
that's theoretically simple hard data.
"i mean i'm really talking about the high number of post sixteen special needs people gail has, has to see that i mean they probably exist in other."
mm.
"offices , but erm, and i know she's half time and some offices have only got a quarter, but as i say, she's  the busiest person i know  and, and she's."
yeah.
very efficient.
erm.
"what would you suggest for for, what would we do to address that?"
"well in one sense i, i would like to see jane addressing it, because she can do it from a non-divisional point of view."
"oh sorry yeah i mean how, what numbers do we."
erm numbers?
yeah.
"well i, i think to we could try and make an assessment of the case load, special needs post sixteen case load in and we'd have to do it the work we actually do."
yeah but.
because.
but.
yeah.
erm  there isn't one in northern division.
right but.
so there's no case there's no no numbers.
well isn't there?
"if they're saying they work with people that are post sixteen and a special need, then they'll have to identify those people and have to say, but the."
yeah but if you haven't got anybody in the post.
right.
if we right.
oh sorry.
i understand what you mean.
"and we haven't had any post since last , yeah that's, what i mean is."
"right, but presumably if that, that work's not just going by the board  that's, that's right."
no it's being done by other members of staff.
yeah.
so i mean identifying.
so if.
"the staff the the post,."
yeah.
"and what that post case load is, everybody can't do that uniformly."
yeah.
"but the total numbers of people f e, with special needs, seen in the division."
mm.
"regardless of who they're seen by, that's hard data."
mm.
"and you could then if you wish say well we've got point five of a post, and that person saw eighty percent of those or ninety percent or."
mm.
whatever.
mm.
"erm and if in another division they saw another number erm but their, their particular post only managed to see twenty percent, erm well that tells that the."
mm.
consumers are not getting specialist services.
mm.
and.
mm.
"there's, there's got to be a reallocation."
yeah.
er i'm quite happy to include the case loads erm of special needs c os.
erm.
yeah.
no i just don't want to exclude anything.
no.
that people feel are an issue cos together we have to exclude it.
it's just finding a way of.
"well let's put,."
case loads active.
yeah.
erm special needs c os yeah?
yeah.
and i'm not talking about.
not the not the.
specialists.
senior.
no.
it's the special needs.
yes.
so not.
yeah.
senior.
yeah?
mm.
yeah.
"i mean how, how we're gonna get all the numbers i don't know but, but i mean that's a, when."
i think.
"we see what people are arguing,."
yeah.
what their people's cases are.
"i mean i think at the end of the day because we're going to have to basically in a sense your job i think at the moment you're saying you know fine i'm not gonna exclude anything, i think it's actually going to be , to try and eliminate most of this."
i think so yeah.
because at the end of the day i think that although it's quite significant workload we might be able to address it elsewhere i mean i think the.
yeah.
special needs thing can be addressed.
yeah.
in a slightly different way.
"i think the management thing can be addressed in a different way  erm excuse me erm, oh i've lost my thread now but, oh yeah that's right."
yeah.
"when you're taking so much into consideration, the actual loading or weighting of that factor would actually turn into into something very insignificant weighting i think."
yes.
i mean paul's proposal was to have a spreadsheet of hard data.
mm.
"but we're obviously, we've got debate about what really."
yes.
is hard data now.
to which we add a whole series of other factors that we then kick around and argue over.
mm.
"so we, so we distribute the staff based on the hard data and then you make cases based on other factors."
yeah.
"erm and if you and ray make the same case, then you and ray have to fight for the."
yeah.
"share of resources, if it doesn't apply to any others."
but if.
mm.
everybody makes the same case.
yeah.
"then either we ignore it or we, well we'd have to ignore it wouldn't."
mm.
we?
cos we're  another four.
mm mm.
of staff.
mm.
"so yeah small number of factors in the sheet, and then supplementary debate items."
mm.
"and maybe issues that are, that are dealt with in a different forum completely but erm."
yeah.
yeah?
right okay.
just remind me again whether a  goes towards the bottom or.
"networks links, n y b e c, work experience,."
mm.
"the number of schools in a division, erm."
yes.
"y t, everything in y t."
yeah.
"c l as, clerical to management, mileage to schools, management time as you said."
yeah so all of those things.
"economy to scale is another one, deborah, you need a minimum number of staff erm to service a location."
yeah.
"i mean it's interesting i mean cynthia raised that point yesterday, to which the answer, i mean i'm afraid i have to say the glib answer is, why are you telling me you need a minimum number of two members of staff at lunch time, for a full time office in the centre of town, surrounded by bloody phone calls, in school buildings, when you send one single member of staff aged twenty one,."
mm.
"to stokesley, who if she screamed through a bloody bullhorn wouldn't be heard by anybody?"
yeah.
"you know erm i don't know whether that, i mean i think that's going to be another area of considerable debate."
mm.
how many people.
mm.
do you need.
"erm to be honest it's no good saying you need two members of staff every office, on health and safety grounds."
mm.
or consumer satisfaction grounds cos we haven't got 'em.
mm yeah.
"we can't, we can't say, can't erm really just contradict ourselves like that can we?"
no.
"i, i think it's an interesting."
"no, i don't mind the contradiction but."
argument because.
yeah.
"i think you can, i, i've, the same argument has occurred to me special schools."
where there might be a very small number.
mm.
"that almost regardless of the number, you've actually got to do a certain amount."
"you've got to, you've got to physically go there two or three times, you've got to form the agreement."
relationship with the school there's only one person there.
yeah exactly.
"erm erm i, i think that you know i, that had occurred to me in the past."
mm.
that we should actually look at a a minimum.
yeah.
"number of days per institution and then the weighting over and above that is on the number of pupils, mm."
"for number of pupils, yeah."
what's a i mean we could easily say it's.
i don't think it's.
you know it's you could easily say it's a minimum of three days.
yeah.
"just to introduce yourself, meet the staff."
that's right that's right.
start the agreement and finish the agreement.
yeah yeah.
and that is including.
"i think schools it only really applies to special schools, i think once even in some of the small independents, once you get over about forty or fifty, then you're gonna have enough contacts."
yeah.
anyway.
yes.
yeah.
erm to keep the thing going.
but.
yeah.
"certainly with some of the specials, especially where the numbers fluctuate so much from."
yeah.
"year to year,."
mm.
to maintain the relationship.
"yeah, and you know when you've got a specialist school that is one site special, special education needs pupils, nursery, primary, secondary,."
mm.
all in one school.
mm.
erm that causes problems .
mind you more for the governors but hard luck.
so all of these are the factors that.
yeah.
people have come up with.
i'm gonna simply list every single factor.
yeah.
on a single sheet i hope yeah?
provide.
yeah.
a magnifying glass.
"i will asterisk those which i believe are the simple raw data that paul referred to, and the remainder are the."
mm.
"you know the, the supplementary debate items."
mm.
but which have to come with numerical evidence.
yeah.
yeah.
so really if we did agree that any of those supplementary factors were going to be significant.
and they'd only be significant if we were expecting a significant disproportion anyway.
yeah.
"erm then we would actually go, have to go that meeting on the nineteenth and and come back with that information."
yeah.
for you to process.
"well unless i, i ask you beforehand you know."
yes.
i circulate this beforehand.
yes.
yeah.
so we come prepared.
which would be the best thing.
yes.
"one of the other things you talked about briefly yesterday, cynthia and i, was er cynthia believes that northern division operates in a radically different way to other divisions."
mm.
and there are a number of reasons that she believes that.
"erm but we were also looking, i mean we were looking at you know how many staff you need  a minimum number of staff, economies of scale."
"now in our debate we, we had separately actually come up with very similar processes."
"erm which was to, to audit what staff were required to run a division in a month, of four weeks."
mm.
"or a statistical month, i mean a month of four weeks is probably easier."
"erm so we were saying , and this is what we, we'd actually come up with, the five days of the week, and the three categories of staff, i mean i've just obviously put erm c l as are in either c l or e o really."
mhm.
i mean they're c o really grading and what.
this er the careers centres in.
yeah.
terms of servicing schools or anything like that it isn't.
no everything.
oh it's everything?
yeah.
ooh god right.
"so, oh no sorry this was in centres."
yeah?
yeah.
to staff the northallerton office.
mm.
the way the standards require it to be we need the following numbers of staff.
and we had to do it over a week and over a month because some weeks you do things that don't do.
yes.
the previous week.
"erm thirsk, richmond, leyburn, stokesley and in the whole, and that's a hundred percent."
mm.
erm and then see how many we'd got.
you know.
mm.
you need that.
mm.
and how many we'd actually got.
mm.
erm and part of the problem's always gonna be there's part time staff who.
mm.
for a variety of reasons only work certain days.
generally speaking those days are agreed by the member of staff's needs the organizations  interviewed.
"or they're historical and you can't change them, yes."
"or historical, yeah."
erm or they're related to attendance at meetings you know er no.
mm.
"good saying, your job is tuesday and friday."
mm.
but actually we have a meeting every every monday.
mm.
afternoon.
mm.
so i mean we've got more people in on mondays.
mm.
"not because that's the best day for them to be in to do their work, er it's not, erm but because that's when the meeting is."
"yeah well we had, we had to abandon that, we we brought all our employment officers in on a friday, erm and we just couldn't staff the office the rest of the week you see."
yeah i know.
it's gone by the board and i have to confess we've not had a.
i think a meeting of.
proper meeting for a long time.
an hour a week meeting is means that there's not adequate communication.
mm.
"in the office, doesn't."
mm.
it?
"i, i'm going to have to have one meeting and let people, say you've got to come to one or the other and have them at different times during the week."
yes.
"i mean i, i, there is actually an argument for having one meeting, everybody knows when it is and where it is, and if people feel they're being left out or not getting informed they should make the case that i am."
mm.
not being informed.
or if.
mm.
"it's evident that they're not informed because they're not doing what they're required to do,."
mm.
"erm they, we have make sure they get get told."
but.
yeah.
we can't have.
yeah.
i can't i can't function on.
inflexible everybody comes in for an hour.
"we've got certain amount of erm the factor where people will say well i, i'll swap that week because there's a meeting."
yeah.
"i'll come in the morning instead or whatever, erm but quite often it means if they're coming in they say, well i'll be in town anyway i'll come in for that hour."
yeah.
they're building up flexitime which.
yeah.
has got to be taken off at some other time erm.
"and one of the issues that we're talking about is operational matters, not all of which is a matter for open debate so."
mm.
they're there to be informed.
mm.
of a management decision.
yeah?
mm.
"erm so as it's not an open debate to produce a decision, very often, and it will be less so i imagine, erm they don't need to be there to listen to this debate."
so they need to be there to hear the answer.
and the method that we're going to use.
well those that are there can do that and contribute to some extent.
"those that aren't will have the minutes, yeah?"
mm.
or clear instructions that are.
"you were saying that the, the trainers pay for all these horse walks and maintain them?"
your.
erm  what do they.
"heath fees, there's heath fees, and there's all, all you have to pay for the heath fees and all, you know."
hmm.
"oh, yes."
was that for training?
yeah.
"training was very very dear today, i dunno what it is now  it was very very dear  to train 'em."
to own an animal you wanna be a millionaire you see.
"well, you want a lot of money, don't ya?"
to do it well.
"well, you know what it is buying one yourself."
you gotta feed it properly.
mm.
"cost you a fortune, wouldn't it?"
mm.
"then, there the field, if you got a field to turn it out in, provide hay ever day, buy tons of hay for it, that's alright."
you don't want it to have a lot of corn.
you only want  corn when you're working them.
when you're hunting them and doing things like that.
but hay  suits any animal.
but you  that you can.
mm.
"going back to the war time, the second world war, you said that racing wasn't considered to be an agricultural industry."
"breeding of horses was,."
yeah.
but not racing.
"so what, how did the racing industry get on during the war."
how did they manage?
"well, they had to, they only raced at newmarket."
"all through the war, they raced at newmarket see fetched it all to one meeting, they didn't have to travel about."
"see, the animal didn't have to travel about so and most of the trainers come here, you see."
"oh it was very good in the war time, cos there was only  just i can't tell you now."
"i could tell you offhand, if i'd known how, where the race was or  there's not many places."
"but all, all my races was run at newmarket."
"some was run somewhere else, but i couldn't tell you where now, not offhand."
but all the races was run at newmarket or newmarket heath.
all everything.
"that were all, all cos of the war, see?"
mm.
"and, all run here, everything was run here, and animals, animals that won here, well er well i think they put them down as better animals than animals that raced before the war, you know, cos they had to do such a lot in a short time."
"you see, because all the air force had all the heath, they didn't have a lot of heath to train horses on, you know, then."
"you only had little bits, they claimed  waterhall for, for farming."
"we had to had to plough that up, and put and put er feed in it."
where was this?
oh what we call waterhall.
waterhall?
"yeah, where you come down that hill from the boy's grave."
yes.
"well, on your right that's all, that's all waterhall down there."
that's all training round in there.
mm.
see?
"that's on the, mm, that's on the kentford road from bury coming in, isn't it?"
yes yeah.
then when you get down into well bottom.
"you see a house on your left, don't you, pass the house on your left, well all on the right is a what they call the limekilns."
yes.
see?there the limekilns are on  well bottom to the top of the down.
till you get traffic lights.
yes.
"all laid out special, you know for training."
mm.
galloping ground.
"during the war you had to grow food on it, you said."
what?
"during the war you had to grow food on it, you said to me."
food.
you had to grow food.
yes.
"during the war,."
yeah.
"you had to grow food on those  areas,."
yeah.
where you said.
you weren't allowed to use them.
oh no  you weren't allowed er  only the limekilns we was allowed to use.
"oh yes  they'd be erm, tt agriculture."
"they'd ere pinch 'em, you see."
they'd have to give so much away.
same as the south fields they pinched all a lot of that.
"we had to grow potatoes and saffron everything, you know."
and these were usually on the training grounds.
otherwise they'd have built on it or summat like that you see.
that's why we have to do it.
"but it's all, all back again in its own place now."
mm.
"see, but the south fields, what was, was a good training ground for all of us."
"two mile round, there was er the air force was on it, you see, the ninety ninth squadron was, was down here see, all, all the war, all them, all that ground was under, under, all undermined with big petrol tanks."
"oh yes, all down there that's where they bombed when the war was on and when they killed the people in the town."
oh yes.
"this was a great place, this was, very, very, very dangerous."
was there a lot of people killed with the bomb?
"one, two, four i, four i think  four i think was killed tt."
whereabouts did it fall?
outside the picture place.
"outside the er odeon what you'd call it,you know where outside there it fell."
"killed the girl in the post office, i know."
post office is this side of the road in them days.
"what, on the opposite of what it is now?"
"two, two and three in the town were killed."
"market day it was, you know, oh yeah."
it was during the day?
"yeah, i was down the paddocks, i was, i was."
i was down the paddock.
"before, i couldn't get down the high street for bricks and  houses, but  they're not there now."
i couldn't get out quick enough .
i didn't know where it was.
how did the war affect your training of the horses?
"oh, it didn't interfere didn't interfere with didn't interfere, the only thing about it, you had to do everything in daylight, there were no lights allowed at nights, you know."
mm.
you didn't have none of this.
no electric lights.
you had to do everything in daylight.
"you know very, that was, that was about the hardest part about it, cos no sooner you were done, you had to start again you understand?"
mm.
"cos you had to get, do it with lights, and every window was blacked over, oh terrible."
terrible to work in it.
"but er, we, we got through it all, didn't we?"
we got through it.
"but that's, that's what happened."
did the horses do ?
"yeah, oh yeah."
"they didn't worry about them, they  carried on just the same."
"you done everything exactly the same, only you didn't have the  time to do it in."
"you  woke up about an hour, you know the nights are shorter ."
"well, you see  you finish in the morning about half past, half past twelve we used to, cos no sooner you get your dinner and had a drink, you had to be back again two o'clock or half past two to start on 'em again, you see,."
mm.
"which, you got the stables shut up before it got dark at four o'clock, ain't it."
mm in the winter time mm.
"see, for the lights  so you weren't allowed to put the lights on you see for the bombers."
"show the germans coming over, you know  see 'em now you didn't have no street lights, did you."
you didn't have no street lights.
no.
"all treated , you see."
mm.
ah ah.
did racing continue the same during the war?
racing?
"oh yeah, we raced just the same we had to do it early, some of them leave, and we started at sometimes half past eleven."
"finished at half past two, you see,you know, shortened it up like that."
"oh yes, they, they got, they got through everything alright pretty good."
"they're very good, very good indeed."
marvellous how it was run to tell you the truth.
"oh, yes those horses come in horse boxes them days bit of luck trains."
"they got them here, you see for the races."
"they used to come a day or two beforehand, you see, so they could be settled down and then race."
"oh yes, everything was, it was very well run, it was manoeuvred very very cutely it was."
"very, very cutely."
"but, you didn't, you didn't have the time to do a lot in  the muddy light beat you."
"but you see you had to do as good as the same amount now, you know."
you only got the same amount of money   end of the week.
you didn't get no more .
no it wasn't easy.
talking of the racing itself.
have the racecourses always been as they are today?
"or, or were they different in your childhood?"
"no, always the same."
just the same as they are today.
"you know there were no difference in them only  er as they go along now they're putting plastic rails up being wooden, you see 'em there."
"see so many accidents happen, you see they're putting plastic up now."
"then when we're bump against it would just bends over, you see."
mhm.
"oh yeah, that's the only difference  they be doing every racecourse like that."
and you'll find in time the racecourse'll be made of this here special stuff what they're galloping on.
"on the heath a special stuff they gallop on, you know."
"oh, the all-weather."
"yeah, the all-weather."
gallops?
"yeah,what we call the all-weather gallop."
mm.
"well, some of the racecourse gonna be made like that and it cost a fortune, mind ya."
"i suppose newmarket will be first one to make two,they've got two courses here as it is you see."
"they'll do one, experience on it you see."
"see how it goes and make it all, all the one meeting that have july course, like we was all through the winter."
"all through the war, with july course you know you see."
you didn't have no racing on the first course.
which is the first course?
the first one.
mm.
as you go er the bottom one.
then there's one up up the cambridge road ain't there?
what one's that?
july course they call they call that.
"see, there's two racecourses in newmarket."
"there's none in newmarket, really."
"there's a  there's erm  let me see one, two, three, there used to be one, two, four meetings in burrough wood and two in stetchworth."
"see, the july course comes under stetchworth."
yes.
"see, and the first course comes under burrough wood you call it."
see.
that's how they're so rich.
"there's footmark, footpaths all over the heath you know, where people can walk, and they keep sticking sticks in the heath now, but they knock 'em down."
they can't stop 'em.
they stick.
well bits of sticks in.
sticks in?
"you know, so they don't make paths for horses who jump over."
"see, you can't stop the people walking on cos it's a law, you see."
there's a byelaw all paths you see.
so who puts the sticks in the ground?
the heath men.
they do.
"you know, trying stop you from walking on the."
ah.
walking in the path.
but you pull them out chuck 'em aside you see people do.
they don't take no notice of it.
"see there was a case a little while ago weren't there, about farmer ploughed up a footpath  you used to get on a stile to walk across the field."
"then you used to get they're all byelaws, weren't there."
"ah, in the end they fined him a lot of money, and they had him  can't stop the public, you can't do that you can't."
no.
"so people walk over the racecourse, do they?"
"ah yeah, you can't stop people,."

"nowhere for you to go, was there?"
is it.
today they can't do it.
mm.
if you'd got the sack.
what?
if you got the sack.
yeah.
would you have found it difficult to have got work at another stables?
"oh, no."
you wouldn't find it difficult.
you wouldn't find it difficult.
very seldom you heard of 'em getting the sack.
very seldom.
"same as stud grooms, you never heard much stud grooms getting the sack."
or head man.
"see, you you, you got so controlled, you knew the runs of the horses, you knew the ways of your horses, you knew the ways of your guvnor and, you change, you got to start a role all over again."
you see what i mean it.
that's why they don't sack people like that.
"you keep er and blacksmiths, that's why they own their own blacksmiths."
"well, you see, if you keep changing the blacksmiths about and they're altering horses feet all the time, putting plates on, putting shoes on, you see  it's a game of its own."
"it's one, one consistent game of its own."
"so, a blacksmith, then will."
"ah, they they all had their own blacksmith."
you got one.
you got one.
"one blacksmith does that yard, they or two, two do the yards now, cos there's a lot of ."
then two do them between them.
"and the blacksmith, is he an independent person?"
oh  yes.
the guvnor is.
well he can't interfere with him.
all you do is you put on the list all will want shoeing.
"or come and send for him,he what has to be in the yard, the blacksmith has to look thirty to forty horses  their blacksmith has to look round every one of them."
he has about sixty here.
every one of those horses he has to look round for all four feet up.
"that's two up, that's two up at er two or three up at , or ."

yes.
that was  on the place.
"oh, i see, he had his actual own."
"oh, yes."
blacksmiths?
"oh, yeah."
because there are also some independent blacksmiths.
"oh er , oh yeah, got his place, well his men go round, he had got two or three men in every yard he has,."
mhm.
"he's just died, he has er he was head man of the lot of 'em."
"the head blacksmith, of the lot."
"he was jockey club man them all, oh yes."
"you couldn't come and, you come bouncing in here and say you were a blacksmith."
you couldn't get started.
"oh, no."
so strict.
so you have to be.
you had to be certified and serve your apprenticeship.
and accepted by the jockey club.
"with everything, yeah,for a blacksmith today."
what about in days gone by?
what?
what about in days gone by?
days gone by?
"well, you had to send miles for them, didn't you er er blacksmith."
"blacksmiths were the thing on the side of the road, didn't he do all the wheeling, mend your wheels, and all horse, all iron wheels, and things like that, won't years ago, and you had to send for him to come and do 'em,well, he had men that he'd, that he'd taught like boys, apprentices."
"he, they used to go out and do all the outside work for him."
all the horses?
yeah.
oh yeah.
"blacksmiths started on the side of the road, that's how blacksmiths started."
"who's gonna do all them years ago, was all horse and carts,."
mm.
who was gonna  axles and the bicycles and everything like that.
but in newmarket with the racing stables.
"oh, there was always blacksmiths here."
always blacksmiths.
"did they have their own blacksmiths then, or would there be like in the town that went round ?"
"no, no, they didn't have."
they used to have  some had their own blacksmiths.
"the honourable george  like lord derby, he had their own, always did."
"they've shops up there now, all got blacksmiths shop, you see."
every stable.
"we had , you see, everything, everything, tooling for the plates, everything you wanna make."
"your irons used to come longer than this  irons, where you measure horses feet and you know, measure 'em up."
you know they measure across from heel to toe.
mm.
then across from there to there.
from side to side.
"always do on a bed of wheat straw, so you nip it off from where the  you see, and you know your measurement."
yeah.
"oh yeah  asking a man on this television the other night,the heath man."
i don't know if you seen it or not.
", his name is."
now how can you tell the one horse from another?
well  he said it would be by the markings.
"yes, but he wouldn't get the markings unless he be through me."
or somebody in the yard he was paying.
"and you had to get, get a bit of paper and you drew a straight line, straight line, see like that, and if he had two white legs you put a cross, two white  see, if he had a long one, he had put a big cross, if he had a long, two long white leg, if he had me behind you put a cross."
"if he had a white face, you put a mark down that way  see."
"so it's like marking the points out on a horse, with crosses?"
yeah.
mm.
"i'll show you before you go, give you a bit of paper."
yeah.
where we used to mark 'em.
and when they say what we call 'em touts they were called then you know.
touts.
on the heath.
"some people chase them away, wouldn't let you see horses work and all that, you know."
"oh, these were people trying to find out what horses might win a."
yeah.
"yeah, be fit enough to win a race?"
"race, yeah."
mm.
"very strict years ago, very strict."
they used to get up trees with glasses and look  with everything they.
would they?
like spies .
"oh, very strict years ago."
they wouldn't let you see anything.
oh no  er er that's the secret of er  that was.
"oh yeah, oh,have a good look."
"foggy mornings, you used to gallop them in the fog, the best, gallop horses in the fog."
"see  say you don't gonna gallop five you didn't gallop five furlongs, well, they might think you're gonna finish five, you only galloped 'em four."
see pulled up.
you done 'em all like that.
ah.
"get up early in the mornings,take 'em out and gallop 'em, take 'em back in."
shut the gates.
some of the men didn't know they'd been out exercising.
"ah, i'm telling you the truth."
that's where i served my time they didn't  phew.
"these, these touts."
what were they looking for?
"why, the books, report in the papers."
"they all had a paper the evening news, the standard, the star, the sporting life ah all the papers wanted to know about the horses."
"so the the owners who owned them them days you could read about them, but they don't do it today, cos the trainers ring them up and tell them how they're going, don't they?"
so when you put these markings  on your piece of paper.
yeah.
"they paid you for it, they had to pay, to pay."
who paid you for doing that?
wanted them on the heath.
what the heath men or the touts?
touts.
ow!
touts.
",you don't go tell him, it don't come on there does it."
cos you can live down there  you know you're doing this you see.
but that's how they used to know.
oh yeah.
any mark or a white spot on them  all tricks of the trade.
"if the lads had any brains the touts used to say yearlings, they, in the yard got any, yes, get the markings for us, you see."
they used take them and give them a drink.
really?
"but then, most of them relied on the head men, we used to tell them you see, to keep their mouth shut."
"when we galloped them they didn't know, see, mm, years ago they were very particular another man didn't , say i had horses and you had horses, i wouldn't like my horses galloping with yours."
see my meaning?
mm.
"and i, i wouldn't want yours galloping with mine."
you understand?
mm.
so you had to be pally your owners help .
yes.
get my meaning?
so.
"oh yeah, they don't stand for that today, you know."
galloping one owner's horse with another.
oh no.
"phew, you'd be surprised."
"oh it ain't all, ain't all cushy, it's, it's secret on some things, you know."
owners don't know everything.
if they see their horses done.
you shoot me when you have a read of that.
no.
giving secrets away.
"oh yeah, very, very, very  phew oh yeah, they didn't like it."
they used to ring up  owners and they know in the yard.
"oh definitely, they don't mind helping ."
see?
mhm.
that's why lord  wouldn't have to give all that money.
"what was it, ninety, ninety odd, ninety five thousand pound."
won last week at somewhere wasn't last week to lead slip anchor.
"to lead him work, borrowing other people's in the yard."
to lead him?
to lead the horse.
"yes, you have to have a lead horse in work."
your good ones.
"what so you can pace, be paced by it you mean?"
yeah.
"he's doing this horse now, reckless boy, he's leading him now."
oh yeah.
that's why we slip anchor won so far he wasn't from here to  cross the road.
mhm.
"see, cos he had this lead horse  you horses jumped off."
made off couldn't catch him.
that's what this one'll do.
you see.
see him far up ahead.
"they'll be coming down here saying thank you,what's the date today."
"oh first of may tomorrow, yeah, no, friday."
friday.
about the twenty ninth today.
"well, you can always say i missed tomorrow's till the end of april."
they tell me he'll win the derby.
yeah.
"going well he is, i tell you."
is he?
"i think i think the frenchman will win the one thousand tomorrow and er, will ride the winner of the two thousand, different to me, or something, it's called."
"i don't think  'll stay, myself."
"different people, different opinions, that's my opinion."
mm.
that's all i know.
so what would race days be like in.
race days?
years ago?
"oh, they stayed just the same as they are today,you carried on just the same, only the difference in them now, race days years ago, the heath was shut at half past nine."
you couldn't go on the heath and train horses up after half past nine.
"you understand, not this side."
mm.
"race people, race days you see, people come to their races and put their tents and things up."
and you all had to go over that side.
over the bury side.
"over bury side, where you come down that hill."
yeah.
they always worked over that  and around there.
"the other places look across the heath as you come up the, the road anywhere, but not on this side."
half past nine they finish.
"same as the limekilns, they are today."
there's a certain gallop on the limekiln shut at half past nine.
"if it's not shut at half past nine, it don't open till half past nine."
you understand?
mhm.
it don't open till all the  people have used the short gallops.
see cos you have to cross over 'em.
"you have to start at the top of the town that way, and go down over down and come round like that, finish off start down norwich road and come up bury road."
so that's how far round it was.
"i suppose  a mile and three quarters, i think."
"and one red house to the top of the  lights, traffic lights."
from one side of the road up the other.
that's how it used to be years ago.
"i couldn't tell you now the different ways, they do what they like now."
that's all i can hear about.
"allowed to gallop his horses across the heath, er and all this rot."
terrible.
"did erm on race days, how did they organize the races?"
when you were a young lad.
"organize  well, they organize theirselves."
the jockeys.
"that's me, it's , it's my microphone."
"that's erm, erm nothing to do with us, the jockey club do all that."
they organized all the races.
"all we got to do is enter, enter the horses in you get a paper called the calendar."
"when you have that calendar sent you, it's a lot of money now."
"it used to be three and sixpence i think, it is about five pounds now."
"well, you look through it, and every race meeting that's on there, probably five or six weeks."
"and you look through every horse  wherever you want to put your horse in them races are in that calendar and you pick your race out, put your horse in, pay your forfeit."
then you have to pay another forfeit if you leave him in.
understand?
pay another forfeit if you leave him?
forfeit.
you pay a forfeit to put him in that race.
"see, if you want him to stop in it, you gotta keep paying the forfeit all the time them weeks that go by."
same as years ago.
"i don't know, i don't think, think it's altered now, years ago you had to enter your derby horse."
"you had to enter them as foals, and then when you entered them it cost you fifty pounds to enter them, and it cost you fifty pounds for every quarter of that lifetime of that foal."
so you run in the derby.
why did you have to enter them as foals?
"oh, i don't know, that was their idea, years ago."
but i think it's changed.
just.
"but i think it's changing now, i don't know."
"i, i, i been out it a long while now."
"did, did the racecourse used to be busy?"
what?
"busy, you couldn't get through the streets for charabancs and charabancs in them days."
cabs and all all lined up outside the white hart jockey club rooms.
all lined up the street.
"cabs, you used to jump in and drive them up the road cos there were no motor cars."
"oh no  there weren't motor cars out for years, called them charabancs, charabancs you know."
"you used to meet in the avenue, meet in the high street."
what taxis?
meet at the station.
used to be specials from the station.
at station charabancs.
"ooh  all sorts, heath carts, donkey carts everything."
so there was quite a bit of business in newmarket for anyone who.
"oh the pictures, it's a pity i haven't got some."
i ain't got some of the old pictures for ya.
"but it was a, a very good, very good in the old days."
they sold horses outside the jockey club room years ago.
sold them?
"sold them, yeah."
"a man used to stand on,not them gates was there years ago there was a wall there."
"see be on a block, standing on the block."
you used to run your horses up and down outside there and they used to sell them.
"what, racehorses?"
"yeah, anything, and anything."
you sell  everything.
anything.
they sell anything.
up and down that's what they used to do.
when was this?
"oh, this is the old fashion, years ago."
"there's photographs of some people, i wish i could get them 'em."

monday thirtieth may nineteen eighty three.
you've forty one years past service in the lighthouse board george.
yes that's correct.
i was forty one years and several months in the lighthouse service.
now could you differentiate between the the various types of lighthouses?
well there's a lot of there's the land stations which are near towns or and then there's the there were the island stations and then the rock stations.
island stations the families were on them.
all the families were on for except the three weeks holiday during the year they were marooned on these islands all the time.
and the rock stations there were various types of rocks skerrymor and bass rock and bell rock and and er quite a few rocks stations.
so i think we had twelve twelve rock stations er what we called rock stations.
now how many rock stations in your forty one years did you actually serve on?
er well only two er  and skerrymor but i was er three year because it was called a rock station or a relieving station was a big island the island of rhona seven miles long when the sea wasn't near the tower but er  and skerrymor the sea was battering round the towers all the time.
now what is the precise location of skerrymor?
well it's about er twelve miles from tiree and er about er three hours steaming from oban where the relief boat was the relief ship.
and when were you actually stationed on skerrymor?
er from nineteen er forty eight to nineteen fifty one.
three years.
can you describe the actual lighthouse?
well the tower is er i'm not quite sure about the exact height of it it's i think it's a hundred and over a hundred and fifty feet high er the to the top of the dome i think it's a hundred and fifty three feet high to the top of the dome.
and er the tower is solid for forty feet from the rock.
er i don't know how deep it is going in the base in the foundation i think it's about twenty feet to the foundation.
and every stone in that building weighs about a ton and it's er each stone is dovetailed into the next stone and right into the centre it's no lot of er solid buildings are just a a circumference of er stone and then grit you know but this is solid right right down to the centre to the keystone in the centre.
and that's solid for forty feet up.
then there's er the door the door at forty feet and there's er a gunmetal ladder going up the forty feet you've got to climb up to get into the door.
mm.
i believe the walls at the the foot are somewhere in the region of nineteen feet thick .
they're nineteen feet thick at the door.
mm.
and then there's er the the storm doors which are pulled in er during stormy weather and the the doors are oh about six inches each plank and it's about six inches thick.
you've got to haul them in with a winch.
and these storm doors are closed when the gale is threatening heavy seas on and there's another door inside that about eight feet inside that another heavy door and then there's another ordinary door inside that.
there's three sets of doors at the at the entrance.
then the bottom compartment there are two er water tanks.
er take about two thousand gallons each.
for fresh water ?
fresh fresh water aye fresh water and er the water it comes ashore with the ship you know and hoisted.
mm.
up in firkins in seven gallon firkins hoisted up by a winch.
er that was when i was there but now it's pumped ashore with well by hose from the ship you know and er they put water in about once or twice a year.
can you recall the layout of the living quarters etcetera?
yeah well er there as i said the first er compartment after at the door is the water tanks.
mm.
two water tanks.
the next compartment is where they have ten tons of coal in er bunkers.
and the next er compartment is the is the storeroom where er the food is er kept.
the next compartment is a workshop a lathe and various tools there.
next is the kitchen or their living room.
the next is a flight of er flat of bedrooms two bedrooms two bunks in each bedroom.
and the next's another the next flat is er also two bedrooms and er next er flat again is the library which was a magnificent room.
er it was the whole tower from the from the er the coal cellar.
it was actually lined in oak right the to the light room.
most of the stations are lined in pitched pine but this is lined in beautiful oak and oak panelling and er.
then after the the well there's er the library as they called it  was lined with books leather bound books  great big kidney shaped oak table and beautiful chairs there and  we used it as the office you know for the principal keeper did his returns and all the rest of it there.
and er then er after that there was the gun room or the magazine where they stored the ammunition for the  gun and er then the light room.
and the light room the machine case where the machine for revolving the five the lens which er weighed about five tons and there were this machine revolved the lens and it was machine was solid brass erm just which had to be polished every week and er oh beautiful brass polished brass and nobody ever saw these things you know except maybe the commissioners when they came round  no no visitors there .
you were stationed there in nineteen forty five.
nineteen forty five yes.
and that was your first posting as a principal .
a principal keeper yes that's correct.
what were your er reminiscences of the station the lighthouse at that time?
well i was after coming off  and er i was quite used to the rocks you know that type of er station so.
but er well it's nothing really important about the reminiscences there.
mm.
er it was i really don't think of anything outstanding.
say on the subject of shipping at that time.
can you recall the type of vessels?
oh the vessels they were quite well out from us.
er they er in the days of sailing ships they were they were really they were it was really a dangerous place.
cos if they were beating against the wind and and there were three wild reefs about three miles off.
there was er the  who was called after a frenchman who invented some type of lenses and er the mackenzie who was one of the engineers did the building of skerrymor one of the surveyors or something.
and then the er stevenson which the famous one of the famous lighthouse engineers.
the three reefs oh well they were very very dangerous reefs.
you could just see them at low water and er that was one of the danger points but i've never seen ships coming close to skerrymor .
but when i was there there were once one instant is er er the man on watch in the morning he spotted a floating mine come in right down to close to the rock and er er it anchored er er a quarter of a mile or maybe two hundred yards off the rock off the tower and er of well when a mine anchors it becomes er alive.
when it was floating the the when the when it holds it pulls the detonator something to do with a with er with the mechanism of it er.
so it was swinging back and forth almost coming to the rock and we thought well if that mine goes off that's the end of it.
and i er wirelessed the office headquarters in edinburgh told them about this so they sent a mine sweeper out from tobermory.
there were some mine sweepers still floating about there.
and er they went into  coming to skerrymor and said there was no mine there and they turned back to tobermory again.
and we were left with a mine there.
and obvious phoned er radioed to said their ship was we never saw it .
went twelve miles from us to .
er some navigators aboard that boat.
so then er er one morning the there was a very heavy swell on and the anchor must have given way and it we saw the mine floating away towards tiree so where it went after that we never heard.
thank goodness for that.
aye.
how many keepers george were stationed at skerrymor in your day?
er four four keepers.
there were three men on the rock and one man ashore.
and every second month they the occasional keeper the relieving keeper came out local man he came out to make up the two men then went ashore to cover the cover the the reliefs like that.
mm.
and where was the actual relief station?
the relief station was at eredine.
but originally it was er for skerrymor was in hynish and when er  was built they they changed the they took the keepers from skerrymor to ered.
mm.
so there's two the keepers from the both rocks were in stationed in ashore at ered.
and  is another lighthouse out from collessie?
out from collessie it's about twelve miles from iona.
mm.
now one commentator i believe it was the the foreman mason involved in the building of skerrymor described the landing on the rock as being like climbing up the side of a bottle.
yes i i heard of that but i er i think it was sir walter scott actually that said that.
but er yes it was it could be and there was a blow hole there .
they they sent a fountain of er water right up into the air.
now they were drenched with this water sump water coming from this blow hole.
but that was er they put a charge in that and years afterwards and .
the blow hole was still there when i was there and you see fountains of water coming it.
but nothing like what was originally when they were building the tower.
can you describe the actual landing process for supplies and men?
well there was a grating er which was about er oh about er thirty five yards long out to a reef.
and there were pillars going out from it to the rocks er grouted into the rocks.
this is a form of jetty?
just a form of jetty just a grating which is a form of jetty and we put a a derrick up on the end of it.
and when the when the relief came in the ship lay about a mile off the never came near the rock because it was just a mass of reefs you know and the ship lay about a mile off and then the launch came in with a crew of about half a dozen men and the officer the second mate usually in charge.
and then about quarter of a mile off the grating they drop their kedge their anchor and they came in then and then there were two ropes er thrown to them then.
the the anchor rope was and the and the breast called the breast rope and then there's a rope from us on each er the bow and the stern.
and it was very very poor holding ground and there was a man on the anchor rope or there was a man on the three ropes on the crews on the three ropes.
"and er when the anchor man always had his hand on the rope you know and you'd hear him saying, anchor coming home sir anchor coming home sir."
and the engine man he was on his knees beside the engine the engine was sticking over and the officer was in charge watching when we was watching the boat coming towards the grating you know.
"then you'd hear him shouting, let go and the two men let go of the two ropes on the grating and the engine man was shot out and went back and picked up the anchor and reset it and sometimes reset two or three times during the relief."
is there not something of a permanent swell running in that vicinity?
yes on the west side of the rock there's a permanent swell running there.
there's one small landing you can er you can do in the in the west landing they called it.
er they you can very fine day you can make a relief there.
if there was a swell on the east side where the the grating but there was also a gully landing which you get into the gully but it had to be a very fine day to get into the gully and there was a derrick there er you could a crane there that you could take everything the boat but it had to be a very fine day to get into the gully.
tell us something about the provisions in your day.
in my day well every man had an allowance er and we bought our own provisions but every man er they were supposed to be  by the commissioners but you got i think seven and six pence a day each man got seven and six pence and we clubbed that money together and bought our provisions er like that.
but there was three months er commissioners put three months supply of what they called iron rations onto the rock.
er a bowl of flour and er and er so many kists of bully beef and er i think that was about all they they supplied er which wasn't taken.
but we if we used a tin of bully beef we had to supply that tin of bully beef our own seven and six pence.
we used the flour because the flour would go bad then we we had to supply that the commissioners put it in originally but we had to keep it going our seven and a tanner.
and er then but oh we kept er quite a good food to ourselves.
did the keepers receive an additional sum resembling danger money?
oh yes you got er i think it was about er about twenty pounds a year we got er for for er rock allowance they called it.
over and above the seven and six pence a day.
can you recall in the past years the keepers ever receiving beer or whisky allowance .
oh no they got no whisky but they got er eversons when the rocks were started first when the commissioners started the rocks first the bell rock was the first.
and er then  skerrymor and then you had there was erm a supply of beer er er allowed to each rock.
each man got a quart of was allowed a quart of beer a day.
and there then this was discontinued in they gave this beer to keep for lack of exercise keep them regular.
and er then in nineteen sixteen er beer was getting dearer and dearer and commissioners decided to stop the beer and stop the beer and er increase the epsom salts in the medicine chest double the epsom salts in the medicine chest .
and did you ever hear of tensions building up amongst the men?
oh yes very often tensions building up among the men.
and i never had any problem when i was there but some of the keepers had.
er i remember one fellow er i think i can safely mention them now but they're both dead anyway.
two first cousins from the caithness area and er their their grandfather left a croft to the youngest son and these two first cousins were on the rock on skerrymor and er the principal keeper he was an orkney man.
he wakened sometime during the night and he heard this scrummage up in the in the light room.
he went up and here there's two first cousins were fighting about the croft and that was left about fifty years before then started fighting about it and one had got transferred to  and that kept it quiet.
doubtless there were many occasions night and day when a tempest was raging outside.
now what was it like to be actually in the tower itself?
you never thought anything about it .
you knew the seas were hitting the tower but you you had great faith in the stability of the tower.
you never gave it a slightest thought.
was there a problem with communications to ?
not when i was there it was er it was er er radio was there you know and we we called up the shore station at ered at nine o'clock one o'clock and five o'clock every day unless there was er a fault in the radio which we were usually able to overcome.
and the noise of the sea itself how was that affected ?
oh it could could be never bothered er.
well i've seen er the it's receiving er message and suddenly the message cutting out the sea going right over the aerial.
and er the aerial was out the window and up the side of the tower.
the sea hitting that was about fifty sixty feet up.
and the sea hitting it there and cutting out you know and then when the sea went off you established communication again.
what pressure of er water might be hitting the base of the tower?
well er er they er took tests both there and at  and the er the in summer gales the pressure was three tons to a square foot and in winter gales six tons to a square foot.
so that is pretty hefty you know when but it was dispersed round the tower you know it didn't hit in one lump you know.
was there an actual sway in the tower itself?
oh yes there was an actual sway in the tower.
you could you couldn't feel it if you're standing on the middle of the floor but when you went the grating with your chest on the grating you could feel the tower swinging away back from you i don't know what er distance probably maybe twelve inches maybe more i don't know.
but you could feel the sway of the tower when in a in a heavy gale of wind.
not the seas not from the seas.
when the sea struck it it was terrific you know the whole tower trembled and you'd think a giant got a hold of her and shook the whole thing up.
but when there was a strong gale of wind er the er tower swayed a lot.
i recall reading that i think it possibly was skerrymor or cape wrath but it was stated that the pendulum clock actually stopped.
yes that was on skerrymor on skerrymor.  that was a swing.
is that a fairly common phenomenon ?
oh yes quite common the pendulum clock stops quite often used to stop quite often with the wind.
and they're no pendulum clocks there now but they were there when i was there.
oh i've often seen the clock stopping.
and were there things coming of the walls ?
no no never never.
mm.
we never had anything on the walls anyway  .
i see.
now we haven't mentioned the affect of fog.
in your days on skerrymor in the mid-forties there would not be a foghorn.
no foghorn but it was an explosive form of signal station.
er we had er  cartridges a quarter of a pound in each cartridge and er there was a tubular what we called the gun going right up.
it was geared on the top of the dome and er it was really er a galvanized tubes you know.
and they were then there was an electric cable coming from the top with two clips in the top and this cable came right down into the into the balcony door.
and you attached this quarter pound of  to it then you hoisted it back up and there was a clock in the light room which struck every five minutes and every time the clock struck you fired the charge.
and that er explosive charge could be heard sometimes at  thirty miles away.
and some times the ship would be come in quite close to us and couldn't hear anything.
it's the same thing with the foghorns.
er sound is very difficult you know like that to your never quite sure the way it goes.
was this not something of a fire hazard?
no no no the i don't think so.
but have you ever heard of towering inferno style lighthouse fires?
well er er the skerrymor went on fire after i left it.
er about er what would it be about six or seven years after i left skerrymor it went on fire.
they but they don't know what caused that fire er they reckon it was an electrical fault from the generator that er supplied the it was a a fifty watt bulb in each room and there was mainly for the radio.
stewart turner engine er two or three about five horse power or something.
and it was on the balcony in a in a porch on the balcony to prevent fire so it wouldn't go on fire.
petrol engine and it er what caused that fire this night in skerrymor they don't know.
the man wasn't watching the light room he saw smoke coming up under the so he went away down and there was a fire in a in the er in the library.
and er he alerted the other two fellows and there were no fighting there was only about two little fire extinguishers on the tower.
and er there were well they had to get water up from the from the bottom ladder in pails and three men er with pails trying to and they couldn't fight it.
and they fought the fire until they were finally er had to go the tower altogether.
and they were very fortunate it was a fine night and they were able to take refuge down among the reefs and the hole.
then there there was about a thousand rounds of tonnite in the gun room in the magazine.
that er exploded the detonators there and exploded the whole thing.
and er the explosion went right out through the through the trap ladder into the light room and blew the lantern out.
and er it also did a rent about i don't know what about fifteen twenty feet deep that's all it did in the wall.
and er but the whole force of the explosion went right up in the light room.
and the whole thing was wrecked the whole the the erm the floors in each er flat was one big circle of stone er about er it would've been about twelve.
i haven't had time to get it up on the machine to change again quickly but i've had a quick look at the situation the five increase.
yeah.
"so the saving that we were going to make them, by reducing five but increasing the lancer machine bearings and bumping this standard cost one well as it turned out, seventeen margin."
yeah?
mhm.
would would make that three thousand pounds.
which is the one we've just been talking about.
yeah.
and so we were going up from that price to that price.
that's what i wanted to do.
"that's what you wanted to do, you hadn't discussed these with them."
i've mentioned it to him and what he's saying is come back with a firm proposal.
obviously what happened then this was before.
this is because this was the dead stock that we sent him.
the tools  i wanted to get rid of.
okay.
yeah.
it's changed really now the fact we pulled.
yeah.
we've got more of a leverage so we.
yeah.
"need to re-look at how we because he's mentioned , he was in the mire."
right.
"well you know, the five reduction you know, don't worry about that at the minute and and all this sort of thing so."
right yeah.
it it does need another.
yeah.
looking at.
basically what if we do increase to that price.
yeah.
"on the machine build that he's given me for this year, of which that is an example."
the two arrow machines use it and there's a hundred and two hundred and nine machines altogether.
yeah.
mill which will have three of these one each machine.
six hundred bearings pairs.
six hundred and thirty seven to be precise.
right.
yes.
well the difference is about six hundred and seventy two pounds.
you mean the increase in prices.
yes that's how much extra it'll cost him.
yeah.
er we've run up a cost of two hundred and fifty quid getting .
and the rest and the rest .
well this is this is what the point.
yeah.
i think now's the time.
"i want to try and get it done, bearing in mind elaine's going to have to have the baby on friday if she hasn't had it before."
yeah.
"so will more than likely be off next week, but i do want to try and get something done with this and some of the other accounts, i want to try and get them out the way before i."
right.
.
now what's the the how have you calculated the five erm reduction?
is is that because all.
yeah.
these are down five per no that's not it.
"that's down five, that's that's up."
that's up.
because it's the lancer machine.
that one's up because it's the lancer machine.
it's just those two that'll have gone down by five which are the sabre machine bearings.
right.
okay?
so what's that five negative worth to us?
"well what i what i did here, to work it out so i could come some sort of value, is i said i haven't had time to chuck these back on the screen yet to start again."
yeah.
but this is where it got to when we talked about it last time.
"er is i'd looked at the using their machine build which i've built in ,."
yeah.
"on the sabre range, the lancers and the arrows,."
yeah.
it would mean that is the price that they would sell at the nineteen ninety four price volume.
and that's the price  that one.
"yeah that's it, the first five lines."
"so you're going for a five six to five nine, thirteen nine to fourteen six, thirteen seven to fourteen five."
"that's the saving effect, the difference between those two is the saving ."
"yeah, that is the saving that they would have made on each of those builds ."
so we're talking there about.
i'll i'll do it on the computer but.
"savings savings of whatever this is, it's three hundred erm that's er seven hundred, that's a thousand ."
"er thirteen seven  that's eight hundred, that's eighteen hundred."
that's a big one isn't it.
about fifteen hundred.
er that's three thousand three hundred.
forty eight machines you see.
"right, so another sixteen hundred there."
so so that's four or five thousand pounds that we're giving to them.
right and and by putting these prices up on the lancer and that  i was actually clawing a couple of thousand pound back off them.
and that's i was trying to put myself in the position of before.
still offering them a three thousand pound saving.
yeah.
but helping our spread if you know what i mean.
yeah?
right.
now it's a different ball game because we i think we have an opportunity to maintain that price for a while.
i mean it's it's where we feel we need to make the emphasis.
this is based on full full year isn't it.
yeah.
erm one of the things that er  would be nice to end up with is a price on the books which is the higher price.
yeah.
the price we want to end up with on the books is is.
mhm.
"that one, that one, that one."
yeah.
that one and that one.
"yeah, now well this is."
"that one erm i mean i'm i was just i i said twenty pound o six, it was a quick calculation, it ends up at seventeen margin."
erm you see it's it's balancing that between the fact that we don't.
mm.
but we're we're gonna be charging it approximately twice as much as  would.
but we've helped him.
and i think we've got.
but but but we're only charging twice as much as  would erm because  are providing a standard bearing.
er well selected for their standards that we think is the only way they could do it.
yeah.
"although, understanding the  way, volume manufacture and i would say they've probably if they've got similar production facilities, got a very good chance of producing good stuff anyway."
"along the lines of , there's a very good probability they'll just take."
mm.
it straight off the line knowing that it's coming in.
we we haven't got as  precision.
so what's the advantage of of our product over theirs.
nothing really.
think of one.
well er .
there must be some dimensions that have been more thoroughly checked than than er.
well no because i i can't say exactly how  's applying their product.
they could be doing it on a yes well ninety of them will be p five.
they could be selecting them off the.
yeah.
line.
"yeah if they if their churning out the stock that  tend to churn out, i mean i go along for an enquiry for a few and find they've got thousands in stock."
you know.
"and you think, bloody hell, well i'm not surprised they can guarantee getting p fives."
"if i had all them to choose from, i could guarantee it."
i don't know how they're achieving the price.
i mean they're they're they were something like twelve quid a pair.
yeah?
now  john  says he he can only imagine that they're selecting them out.
"but then again, john's a precision man."
yeah.
yeah?
"so you know, coming to terms with how  manage to do what they do, you can see it's probably actually not too bad a price to charge when they can get them cheaper ."
yeah yeah yeah yeah.
but but we also know that if er    select from the end of the line of  standard production.
"they don't select on every feature, they only select on some."
don't they?
no not necessarily they could er they could check for all tolerances.
and i don't know how they do it.
this is it i don't know how they do it.
it's only dimensional tolerances don't forget.
they don't have to  test them or anything.
"well the the p thanks carol, the the the p five specs doesn't involve noise testing."
no it's purely dimensional.
"the thing is,the machine tool industry or super precision requirements become use and take for granted a noise specification, the fact that it must run quietly."
but you can get p.
right well that's something that's something that you've got to you've got to differentiate.
mm.
ours are noise tested correct?
yeah.
p five does not require a noise test.
no.
correct?
yeah.
right so what you're getting from us is a.
noise tested bearing.
right okay.
secondly er.
we guarantee p five.
we we are we're guaranteeing p five plus a noise level.
yeah.
so you're actually getting something that you terribly badly need.
i put the seed of doubt into steve's mind about the fact that i could not say that er  bearings could be guaranteed p five at that price.
"i said, the way they're picking them out, i couldn't say that they can guarantee every bearing."
"right and and what's  the noise test that we put ours through, is that three dimensional noise testing  there frequencies and and."
yeah  the normal .
"right, so so what we're doing is a noise test to super precision."
yeah.
limits.
yeah.
"right is  there anything else like that pardon me, oh dear ."
is there anything else like that which erm er which we do that they may not do.
not really.
it'd be interesting to find out what cage material they're supplying.
what cage material are you supplying?
i've a feeling  b e t n.
b e t n.
yeah so it's the er  cage.
the buttress type thing.
yeah .
"er okay, so you've got your quiet noise running."
quiet noise .
be sure about the cage.
"yeah, it's the  one, i'm not so sure what they would supply you see."
possibly nylon.
they do tend to have single nylon that's a single strip that just folds round.
they do a lot of that  support frames.
do they?
"yeah, a single strip that they actually just feed into the ring and then put the balls in."
"so it's not actually a solid ring, it's nylon thing which sits in."
oh yeah they use that in in the in the p two class product.
they have some of those in.
japanese do it .
"they works, i mean you know, our point is we always you know, we've got the guarantee with the cage and that."
but er.
well  okay so so you're going to you're going to erm emphasize the er the fact that what we are supplying is a noise tested.
mhm.
p five bearing .
yeah.
you're going to emphasize the fact that our cage is erm a buttress cage.
mhm.
er  er polyamide six six.
yeah.
"is it still polyamide sixty six, not ."
i don't think it's changed yet.
erm.
our stocks would still be that anyway.
and er er and and that that these have er substantial advantages for them and and don't know but but there's got to be an element of doubt.
yeah yeah.
"erm and although they may say they're noise tested, erm i think you've gotta question whether they're noise tested to the level."
and you've seen our facilities here.
er and and you know how.
yeah.
how very very careful we are.
mm.
so what you're what you can be sure of getting from us is absolutely on line and you're getting a service .
right.
erm mainly it's where do i put the emphasis.
"i know we've got a lever now, yeah, we're gonna get rid of this  in other words, steve's gonna give us something for it."
yeah.
"yeah, it's identifying where we want to get it."
"now okay, i know what you mean by saying yes, you want to get the higher price everywhere."
but if we took the highest price of everything then we're making thousands and thousands and thousands.
now.
yeah well presumably we're reversing this position.
"that's right, we've got to balance that with the fact that we did promise them a decrease, but we've got the erm leverage of having helped them."
so if we've got.
"well  hang on hang on, hang on."
i'll tell you what we'll do.
i'll tell you what we'll do.
yeah.
how about we leave the price as it is.
"we'll we'll we'll leave no no we'll no no we'll leave these these prices here which we were gonna reduce, we're gonna."
yeah.
leave them as they are.
right.
but we will give them a five reduction on those prices for deliveries between march and september.
so we're giving em it for six months.
we're giving it for six months.
.
that's worth two and a half thousand quid.
yeah.
mm.
er june to december he'll say.
alright june to december but that's yeah.
"just easier you see, cos he'll say the  then for when we do a price increase next time."
"cos if you go back up in september, it's higher for the increase next january."
well that's exactly right.
.
but  but at.
yeah okay but we've got the price on the table.
maybe we don't increase it next january.
mm.
"maybe we leave it where it is, but that price is on the table."
right.
"whereas anything else we do, we've got to fight we've got to claw our way back to that ."
"i'll tell you what then, we've got the two options,we've got the one area of this five where."
yeah.
we don't want to give em it for the whole year.
yeah.
and i've got the standard cost here i need to get up.
right.
"right, now erm i want to get that up first."
yeah.
i want to make profit on one size er.
yeah.
"yeah, keep it on others."
yeah.
"so how about if i look at the six monthly saving,."
yes.
yeah.
yeah.
"i look at what that is in value, about two and a half thousand, i'll look at this one,."
yeah.
"i'll put a reasonable price in there, i see what that's."
in you come.
oh.
that's better.
here.
here.
come here.
"who's, who's making all the noise?"
is it you?
you shouting?
there you are.
are you shouting?
"well , what can i do for you today?"
oh.
well is the results of that x-ray in?
i was away getting my hand x-rayed.
clear as a bell.
is it?
mhm.
yeah.
it's a neuralgia kind of thing.
is it?
yeah.
i'm afraid.
er.
so.
"well, i need another prescription for ."
yes.
"doctor  see about this hair of mine, it's just not coming back in."
it's not coming back in?
no.
and i feel it's getting really really thin.
i mean.
is that right?
i have took alopecia before i mean i thought maybe.
mhm.
"it was because it was the wee one, but that's her."
aha.
"fourteen months, so i mean it should be."
oh aye.
showing as wee bit er of improvement.
be alright.
yeah.
but i mean it's not.
and that bit there's completely bald.
to there.
right.
and this bit here at the top is  kind of starting to go.
right.
get you over to the specialist and see what's.
"and i'm beginning to get a wee bit worried about it,you know ?"
er now.
but er well  distalgesics.
are you are you are you need  are you you alright?
aye.
my voice.
excuse me.
you're not needing the pink ones?
what?
the wee pink.
the wee pink ones no i've still got  cos i've only taken.
diamond shaped ones.
still got some of them?
is it two a day?
two a day.
that's right.
aye.
still got some of them.
still got some of them.
"right, and the the distalgesic?"
getting restless?
are you?
so where is that i'll go doctor  for my hair?
"er, i can make it  i can make it monklands, or strathclyde?"
strathclyde's nearer.
is that handier for you?
aye.
oh.
"er it's immaterial, i mean it's just a matter of putting a different address on the letter."
aye.
i mean it's just i wouldn't like it to go any.
"no, oh no."
no no.
to go any further.
ta-ta.
ta-ta.
say bye bye.
"no,."
"no, she's desperate to get away."
you're desperate.
right.
"right, thanks doctor ."
right.
cheerio now.
cheerio.
this way.
"this way, look."
oh well there was clothes and gardens and  and just the same as it is now.
but oh  that's where the was it the clydesdale bank that's at the top of castle street?
mhm.
that was  and that was a grand shop.
"we used to all wear pinnies, white pinnies, on the top of our dresses and  going to school and i used to go into old mr n and he would say to me and what colour of the bow do you want on your pinny today?"
"and i would say he'd wait for me to say, blue to match my eyes."
"just as a kid he would lift me up on the up on the er counter, you know and  me  i was born in  and then we shifted to the bottom, you know that white house, i think it's all offices now, in the the erm big gates of the cathedral."
you know at the bottom of the market green.
"well the house, you just went in a gate there and went up the stairs there."
so it was just my mother used to see me across the road with my shilling to pay for my pinny.
and one day i i dropped it down the the drain as i went into the shop.
"and i  tears , you know, and er the poor old man he was a very small man, mr , and er he lifted me up and told me never to mind, i could get another shilling."
but i don't know whether i ever got   .
"or whether i got the pinny for nothing, i might have easy."
yes?
did you have to have a different pinny every day then?
oh very nearly.
"oh yes, but they were just things that you tied at the back and and er had a frilled round here  they were bonny."
on the top of your dress.
and what was the pinny for?
oh just dress.
"you were dressed in a clean one, you had a clean pinny on."
"you know, just a thing with sleeves and and er hang loose on you."
you've seen pictures of that surely.
was that to keep the dress clean?
i don't know i think it was just to make us look pretty with a white pinny on the top of  our clothes .
and did all the bairns wear all the girls wear these?
oh yes.
nearly every girl.
well when they were tiny anyway.
mhm.
well it must have been an awful job to keep all these white?
"oh yes and then we oh whenever we had anything like picnics or anything like that, we had lovely white dresses that were made of what they called nun's veiling."
what could i say it was like?
it was a sort of woollen soft material but very er thin.
and the ladies all when they were dressed they would have a skirt made of this and a frilly blouse with a high neck and er a silver buckled belt round their waist.
did they wear very tight corset ?
oh mercy yes.
"yes my aunt was mrs david , and goodness me i can remember her having the laces pulled in."
just slim waists waists.
big bottoms i always  used to say .
what sort of things did they have to keep their waists in?
they looked terribly tough.
"well just corsets like that, and they're fastened on the front with things that clicked in and then sometimes they would have a what they called a oh what on earth did they call that?"
it was a thing made of whale bone that they shoved down side without fastening.
and there were just as stiff as boards.
did they have to keep that on all day?
oh yes.
well did that not do any damage to their ribs then ?
well you would think so wouldn't you but it nobody ever to say anything about it.
did did they have to wear lots of do you remember your aunties or your your mother did they have to lots of layers of clothes or they seem to be.
yes.
"and they they they very often, when they were dressed, they would have a little shawl that they would lay over their shoulders a a long scarf thing you know?"
"they'd have a little fancy shawl or my grandma used to always have a fancy shawl that just a small thing that came, you know, down their back and and my grandma used to wear erm a white much it was just thing like a baby's a cotton thing, tied with a just a string, you know just to erm just a tie under her chin and it would have a wee bit of lace on the corner, or the or the end of the tie, that was through the day and it was all ruffled, and then  when she was on holiday and came into town she had a a thing on her head made of velvet and it all had fancy little things in it."
very posh.
did she live in the country?
she lived in deerness.
mhm.
was it a big event to come into kirkwall.
oh yes.
my goodness yes.
some some of them were never in i well i didn't know my aunt when i met her with a hat on.
my  aunt.
there was one time she was all dressed up to go to town and i didn't know her because she had a hat on.
"i never seen her with a hat on in my life before, but grandma wore a a bonnet, when she came into town."
"and grandma  was the same, she had a she had another little fancy hat that she wore."
funny little things then.
did could everybody afford to have their own horse and gig or or was there a bus that came in or?
"oh never such a thing as a bus, was brakes in these days that went to the country."
"they didn't have a horse bus of any kind, did they?"
no well yes they had what they called brakes that came in.
and erm they the it was a place called diamonds in deerness.
er diamonds was the name of the farm or the place and then it came along to the lighthouse corner.
new lighthouse was the name of the house.
that was one of mu uncles that had that house and  well my cousins have it now.
and then they set off from there into kirkwall about what time?
about nine o'clock in the morning.
and we sat in two rows and two horses pulling at us.
and did they have to stop and change the horses?
no no.
just  you see?
no no they didn't do tat.
but granddad had a lovely little what could you call it?
"a little gig it wasn't a gig either, he did have a gig but he had this thing, a sort of long shaped er what would you call it ?"
i i've got mixed up with the names of the things.
before my time.
i think it's  oh by jove it is.
er and they used to sit in that.
erm  two little doors at the well it's just kind of the shape of what could i say it's the shape of?
well there would be a seat they would be facing in their seats.
there's a picture of granddad in in erm that new orkney book that came out.
erm what's the name of it?
what the.
david  david  stanley  had a whole lot of pictures and there's an awful lot of pictures in it belonging to my granddad and grandma.
we're not in it but me cousins and uncles and aunts and everybody's in it.
is that the the  one.
the all the old photographs of orkney  i've seen that one.
yes.
yeah.
"well if you see an old man sitting there with a a shining fronted cap on you'll know that's me granddad, in a white beard."
is there any sort of shelter ?
well when no no.
no shelter.
what happened if it was a pouring day rain ?
it must have poured on us but i can't  ever remember it raining    you know there was   when we used to go to deerness i had very long hair and we and kirkwall wasn't just the cleanest of place at places at that time.
"and my hair was  gingery, more or less the colour of the map you know, or darker than the colour of the map."
"and when i when it was opened out for me going to deerness, well that was a great event."
"grandma used to always say, oh i know she's on the bus because i can see her here."
"and er when i went to school, miss  the old teacher, she used to take me out, er i used to go to the school ready to go to deerness, we had to ask out a quarter of an hour early."
"and erm when because we went the first day of our holidays, right away, to deerness to my mother's people."
"and er  i had to ask out this quarter of an hour early, well i got me hair all combed out all ready to go you see?"
"but miss  used to take me out into here, to the teachers cloak room and and er er plait my hair up again and say to me, i'll take it out before you go away isa, because there was it wasn't a clean place in  kirkwall ."
such a thing's never heard of days i don't think.
so you said that there wasn't an upstairs downstairs kind of thing then?
well i didn't feel it.
i never i never had that feeling.
"we certainly were like being in the army more or less, and er there was the head servants and erm the under servants, you know?"
"but it was er we all had a respect for and 's jobs, but there was none of this erm upstairs downstairs and running frightened for people or anything like that."
"we all kept our place but we all it was as i said, just they gave you credit for what you could do."
it's er well how can i describe it to you?
but we never were made to feel inferior or er erm anything like that.
i never i was never made to feel that way anyway.
"i just get so annoyed at this english women that wrote that book, upstairs downstairs, you certainly we know that the butler and the cook are boss, you know."
they're the they're the head ones and they're place in you're in charge.
but you don't rub up against that horrible feeling.
"what was society in orkney  just before you left, you said you were a young girl and you left about nineteen nineteen."
yes.
"was there er was there a big gap in society in orkney, were there you know were the rich were rich and the poor were poor?"
"oh yes, dreadful."
far worse than anything i ever met in the south.
"and er there there are no real er gentry in orkney you see, and you'll always find that if anybody gets a a a well as i said to one boy here, i said to him look here i said your old grandfather worked in that shop till his backside was hanging out his brigs."
and i said that's the reason that you can get a car anytime you want it.

nineteen eighty three.
mr tommy  inverness.
can i ask firstly mr  when you were born?
august  the sixth nineteen twenty nine.
now was this in tormore?
in tormore house er by lochassynt.
in sutherland ?
in sutherland.
that's correct.
and how long were you in fact  there?
well the time i would be about eight years old  when my father decided there was a change in the estate then and it was off to argyllshire dalmally that sir douglas  and lady  as she was then decided to go and wanted my father to come with him.
but him being from up there and my mother also and their people were still alive which was my grandparents on both sides they were very reluctant to go.
but when a job came he he would be wanting a different  shooting ground in in argyllshire comparison to the hard rocks of sutherland.
mm.
pine pastures green to the tops of ben dorain and and up black mount where the craig estate took it was it was in their estate.
so therefore my father was very keen to go too.
mm.
and that's how we decided to go.
so dalmally i should safely say was my first schooling.
i was about eight and a half.
mm.
now your father was the the stocker at tormore is that right ?
yes he was the stocker at tormore.
who was he employed with then?
well the estate er er er the duke of sutherland had the whole of assynt and then general stewart who was born in nedd and worked and made his fortune if it was as you would say in canada on the c p r.
canadian pacific railways and he was able to take a lot of people from the place he was born in  out to canada.
mm.
what d'ya recall of your early days with your father at tormore?
pardon?
what d'ya recall of your early days at tormore with your father?
well  he was a very active man my word he would soon go right from the house to the top of  as you would say because we had sheep then.
and if he saw a sheep that shouldn't be where they were and the gentry about to come within days he would soon get them down.
mm.
without a collie dog.
and well i remember hearing about it and and saw it probably as i grew up myself.
so he was  and it had it's tormore house was really a lovely place.
did the did the gentry come fairly frequently to the estate?
yes.
oh they came up with their servants all servants up from the south by train to inverness and then a charabanc or vehicle of such that was in it then because it was only metal roads we had then.
but they were good metal roads that took all the traffic.
well i remember at that time the steam roller that was just doing the road outside tormore house and many's the day i was trying to get on it with a very good friend of ours that's now dead.
a hugh .
no  relation but a great friend of ours.
he was a steam roller driver.
mm.
and were the gentry in er lochassynt lodge or was it tormore?
no lochassynt lodge.
that's right.
lochassynt.
that's right.
and my mother er went to help them in the lodge in the season time also.
from that time can you recall any incidents which er your father may have mentioned to you even as a young boy?
well.
or stories about the the people that were there or.
well.
passers by?
ah well yes the passers by will will remember being on the road side the famous tramp.
aha.
the gentleman of the road.
my word and me just as a little boy of eight years.
i was no fear of being frightened of them because they were part of the establishment.
and well did the gentry know that too.
you mentioned that you were perhaps more scared of er ministers.
well yeah ministers er.
when i think of it nowadays and i see children so very going round to the various churches that when people used to say about ministers well.
when you heard there was a minister coming i was just afraid and looking to see would you see that dark black clothed individual coming.
and even that seemed a  but thinking of the old tramp and he was in a a sort of all belaggered looking way.
my word but you weren't frightened of him because you were told that he was an old man and one of the road men of the road.
and there was no fright to be taken from him.
is it correct to to say that the tramps actually used to make a special point of coming to to see your father ?
oh yes.
made a special point of coming there because they knew my mother would give them a bowl of soup or what was ever on.
she was baking fresh scones hot cakes anything that was going.
and my word they enjoyed it well.
they wouldn't come in they wouldn't come into the porch even.
they would sit outside wait in that days we had a seat out in the and was a seat for sitting outside they would sit on their own way or on a rock.
no they just had their own way of life and you wouldn't change it and they had stories to my father.
they would tell sing where they came from and who they saw and all the way up they came.
and they would be looking for a bed for the night and it would be in the old  hay shed that we would put them but there wouldn't be a problem.
it was in the winter time so it was full of hay but they would be very careful and we would ask them that they had no matches er there was no cigarettes much and that but pipes  they were pipe smokers.
old clay pipes with black twist.
but they would soon tell that they would have their before they would go to bed and thanks er very much when getting the bed and you could er vouch for that they would never.
but the odd one yes we saw the odd one but they were very odd.
aye they were very odd.
you refer to them as mile stone inspectors.
mile stone inspectors and gentlemen of the road.
mm.
and there's a story about the late duke of portland when he was travelling to  estate where his lodge was.
there was many's a tramp that would have taken the a nine then but this one and he was very very fond of him and he would ask when he was around to that he would get over to see him.
and when that poor tramp perished out on the roadside one severe winter or spring time the duke found out where it was and to this very day there's a little mound and a stone put on it.
that was the er lord of caithness i think tommy that the stone was.
yes yes that i'm referring to yes.
the lord of caithness.
i cos i can't picture another stone you know on any other roadsides and i've been on plenty that and i travel and no and i can never know of another stone that was put a tramp.
anywhere in the north as far as i know.
but that one was and i heard a year ago but i never saw it till the bus driver i went with some years ago john o'groats.
mm.
and going to john o'groats and right into past castle may where the queen mother has and into the church where where the royalty goes when they're living up in up in castle may at er well er johnnie groat is buried there too.
there's many a person johnnie groat to my name.
from these young days that you spent in tormore can you recall how the tramps actually looked?
oh they they.
how would you describe them?
erm the tramps?
well fearsome looking.
wild looking as you would say it now.
but but the very opposite to what people would er er think of them people now.
and that's ordinary people.
but but they looked wild because they would have long hair beards a  and and all oh my word they were wild looking but er.
and probably it was cold weather they would have two or three coats er you know.
and jackets probably below and their little bag of stuff.
whatever they were carrying.
they they generally came all year round?
yes oh yes generally came.
ah but they always watched they would be in some place over bad storms you know.
er er er you know if there was a bad storm somebody would oh you better stay here today too again and he might be there three or four days.
so he would still stay there because he was told about the weather.
and he would know himself.
mm.
you see it's not what er anybody else would say that it was good weather.
he they knew that they had a great sense of the weather themselves after being out in it.
did they ever mention to you or your father that they in fact got caught out by the weather?
oh well sometimes yes they would be very wet when they would come.
and when they would offer to no no they wouldn't they would have their own way of drying it in in their bags they would have another clean or or you would say clothes to put on but we never ever heard of them doing a washing .
mm.
or whatever.
well they would be discarded.
it's it's like i i better not say say this but irishmen over that when when i when i used to work with irishmen my word they was good irishmen.
very good friends of mine.
but they would work they would never see them with dungarees.
they came with a good suit on and they would go to work with a suit double breasted and then and they would  work there and make a lot of money and when the next thing they would do they would hit into town and get all rigged out and then that was them from top to bottom from their hat right to their feet and then they were hitting the road then.
yes i could say that that's true about irishmen.
mm.
the the tramps never mentioned some of the places they were actually forced to stay whether it was under a road bridge or?
oh oh yes they yes they would stay under a road bridge too because you would see the er er if you would look a a bridge and they would say oh there's a tramp  there's a place there if you could tell me and you would see the rocks put up and where the bed was always above water level oh yes.
mm.
below the certain bridges.
mm.
depending how far away a house you see was and how they would be.
but never two of them meet together.
we we you never know that.
they would be always er passing.
they didn't go round like that they were very loners as you would say.
and what happened say.
they would never.
were there ever occasions when there was one or more in your hay loft?
no no i don't think ever i can remember.
i well i think er there was once or something but he he passed he didn't know that this er was so then they passed on.
mm.
you see one stayed but he was there before him and the other one carried on.
no they would never they would never blend together.
mm.
like whiskies  blend .
no no they would never.
they were they were very very fine people.
and and the tinkers that came there.
mhm.
er wouldn't want to but from from  there was there was one lot.
and there were and the women folk would have their haberdashery and the men were tin smiths.
they would make pails and basins like you were being requiring in your er scullery or in the milk house as you would keep milk there.
so they were all and very industrious looking.
but they had for the winter time they their houses to go to.
mm.
and they were just coming round in the summer.
mm.
and their horses and my word they fairly looked after their animals mhm.
did the crofting people have any special name for the the tinkers?
not really no.
you've never heard the term summer walker?
er er no no i could never say that.
or mystery folk or?
er well.
celts.
as the years came on they were beginning to get mystery folk but er not in my time.
well that sort of people that was coming.
if ones came as  in little wee pickups we called them the little lorry things you would keep your eye very much because you didn't know they were looking for scrap and if you told them you had nothing they might go away with your iron gates or something.
this was during the mid thirties?
oh yes i would say that yes that was coming more that way yeah yeah.
coming more that.
how about the individual er tramps?
did you ever have bye-names for these characters?
well there was one joe wrench.
er but i don't know what's that.
but somebody so told me aye and i said that was a funny name or was it else's then.
well i said i remember a man called joe wrench and but er oh i wouldn't er but one  said oh joe wrench is very black looking.
well the bugger is just coming on and he was cleaning the car down hosing her car so he says i turned the hose on him.
well the hose landed on him alright but it landed on his parcel and it the whole thing fell out on the road.
so there was a bit of.
mm.
among the few people that saw that happening.
but er he was quite a character the man that did that.
did you ever have an opportunity to to see what the tramps actually carried with them?
no well i could never say i i was kept well away the but my father probably might have seen.
mm.
in his bag.
well i think it would be a change it's when they're when they're when they're jacket would be wet they would have another.
mm.
jacket in the bag.
so whatever he and if he was dumping anything oh er er they would ask the father said er just er to dump that.
they wouldn't be left with a whole pile of stuff or er.
no oh no they or they would dump it in a place where nobody would see it you see.
and when they were coming along lochassynt were they making for anywhere ?
well er er see they were on their rounds and then they'd be going round by nedd and  and probably scourie they were just doing their circular.
aye they had their places for.
yes it's amazing aye.
and did you have ever a chance to gain some sort of insight into their backgrounds?
who they were in fact?
where they'd come from?
on some cases yes because i was always told this man he that used to come and he was so clean looking and that he was a barber.
well that er er er an englishman that he was trained as a hairdresser.
as a man's hairdresser.
but somebody er whatever he no he didn't carry anything to to do that no.
but that's what he's he told you?
oh yes but he told somebody that he was a hairdresser.
and you would see that they were very some of them intellectual people.
mm.
too and who knows how they went to the road.
mm.
did they fail in their exams or something or went to drink or.
it's said nowadays about drink but i don't know.
they they were quite er learned men they weren't numskulls you know.
mm.
so something just peculiar at that very time put them to the.
did they ever do any form of casual work?
some of them did yes if they came in the springtime and then in the in in the harvest time.
yes oh some would work but some wouldn't.
er and if if they would work they didn't want money for it but they would stay a while with you they would get their bed for the night and they would get their grub.
mm.
what type of work did they  ?
well they would take in er er er they would er er and they would put hoe potatoes you see when that was coming on that time.
and they would help to lift potatoes and they would er stack corn and hay.
oh yes and that's those only that would do it but you wouldn't get the ordinary man taking any he would just be on his rounds.
and you wouldn't say oh i think it's going to be wet today john you better stay.
not him his his mind was made up on going and that was it.
and were you visited by the peddler the pack-man character.
yes.
who sold goods.
oh oh yes er er who who sold.
er there was one chappie that  er erm i can remember of him and he had a suitcase and well he had a shaving soap i suppose cos people used soap then with your shaving brush and and that and proper shaving brush and razor blades probably that quite.
yes but i remember right a .
so it was things that wasn't too heavy to carry but things that was always needed in a house and that you could run .
when we were er were living all on the road so we were expecting to be supplied by vans.
mm.
and my word there was plenty of vans in them days.
both getting butcher meat.
what even in the thirties?
yes oh yes er er when we had a wee baker's van coming up from the nedd to lochassynt when when  lochassynt lodge you see.
so these people that had little private shops in them days did well because when the people came to the lodges it all the commodities were bought to them.
it's not like nowadays when people has big fridges.
mm.
buy their stuff away down south and take it.
but no they would buy it there aye .
so provisions were bought fairly regularly in those days.
there wasn't the same er bulk buying that you see nowadays ?
no no there wasn't the same.
but only well we would get it buy it in bulk ourselves supplied by er hamiltons of glasgow.
mm.
and it would be coming on the steamer mcbrayne's steamer and.
lochinver?
yes to lochinver yes and that same steamer would be calling in kinlochbervie and all the villages and this traveller for hamiltons would be going round beforehand and you would be getting a hundred weight of sugar and tea it would be in a big tea box er er probably er er ceylon coming from ceylon but you the whole or you could buy a small quarter.
but oh yes you would buy all that stuff in bulk.
mm.
but that stuff that was in bulk but you would never er no perishables no.
mm.
can you recall in those days tommy how people kept perishables?
well er er there were it was big caverns that'd be underground.
if there was a big bank at the back of the house they would have a hole just dug out and er built up with flagstones.
mm.
and therefore it was when when you would go in there it was quite cool.
mm.
even in the summer?
well wonderfully cool.
they would they would watch where they would where they would excavate this thing out.
mm.
from.
but yes it was wonderfully cool.
mm.
and the produce was salmon ?
and the it was it was kept as within a reason of time it wouldn't.
but er and stuff was salted.
venison.
venison .
you you buy er salt it away in barrels in boxes and and work on it until it was through.
now was that your father's own particular task the the salting of the venison?
oh oh oh no really i can't say that.
er we only probably did it when ourselves we got venison beforehand on the last shooting and to keep.
but no no er there was so many hinds having to be shot in the winter time and and and it would be sent away you see.
but not away what they're doing now or but it'd be sent down to their premises down in the in the shooting lodges in the south.
mm.
and that  and to their friends.
and there would be always a beast or two cut up for to be given to the village.
mm.
oh yes that was one thing.
i always remember that.
so where did the venison actually go to?
well it well ah but ah but they never they never killed it in that quantity as they're doing it now.
mm.
to make money.
no no there was no money made of it.
it was just for their for their own use.
mm.
and haunches of venison that was the best part in the  they would be sent away to themselves  the haunches.
but the other parts with the ribs and all that'd be cut up given to the and the lodge itself for the.
and all the estate men first of all would get everything.
and all the crofters then that was paying rent.
in those days how many people were actually involved on the estate?
well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair paths.
they had to keep the river streams all flowing and if there was any deluge of rain and stones they would have to keep all the pools in good order and they would.
the pools?
yes the pools.
that's the salmon pools.
mm.
you see.
and they would have barriers going out they could the gentry could go out to stand on that ladies and men.
to cross the the.
yes just yes you see.
the streams .
it still on the the rivers.
but now it's made of stonework or or concrete.
mm.
now and that cos that's the only thing that could stand.
mhm.
to the weather.
but er that's the way.
and the and the paths repairing at the riverside and all the bushes round the lodge.
and the gardener there was always a permanent gardener but he was he had enough to do but the estate men would be sent up to clear that.
and painters and joiners they would have themselves.
all self-contained?
yes self-contained yes.
there'd be a joiner and he'd be engaged in a.
"quite a long time i would have start probably with thirty years ago, because me mum always make cheese and i just thought making  when i was still a girl at the school and since we came here and farmed on me own behalf well twenty six years we've been making cheeses here."
is it all your own milk that you use for cheese ?
yes we have our own cows and its all our own milk.
i've got a churn of milk.
how do i go about making it into a cheese?
"well when it comes in from the cow it's at blood heat, and you put it through your strainer and then you drain it and er you leave it be and it coagulates, goes consistency of yoghurt, slightly thicker than yoghurt, and after that stood a certain time you apply heat then you warm it up and you stir it, you break up the curd, and the whey gradually rises to the top and your curds settles to the bottom."
and again you leave it standing a certain time and you pour off your whey and take your curd in to a muslin and er hang it up and again more whey'll drain off cos it's hanging up.
and after a a certain period again you break up that curd and then you pack your curd into your er cheese cokes then and er apply pressure.
"it goes in the cokes mid-afternoon you leave that until next morning and take it out, put in a clean muslin and turn it back in the coke and more pressure until the next morning."
"it seems to be one of the things actually that people that are home on holiday to orkney, you know, maybe you have lived here in the past and orkney cheese is one of the things they want to take back with them, a farmhouse cheese."
oh yes er a local people coming home always like to take farmhouse cheese away and orkney people go on away on holiday again like to take ones off to their friends and relatives in the south too.
now i believe you're having your dairy overhauled at the moment.
how how is this going to affect things?
it shouldn't really affect things er it just makes things slightly more convenient.
there's been a few small alterations.
"i had a dairy before, it's just been updated a wee bit because i make slightly more cheeses than i used to make and it'll make it er easier hopefully."
what's your output of cheese?
"the season of the year makes a difference, presently i'll be making approximately eight pounds probably everyday."
that will increase very shortly i'll have more milk.
"it'll probably go up by another three, four pounds and then later on er when the cows goes the grass i'll be making not quite double probably, but er quite more than i do now maybe fourteen, fifteen pounds in a day."
how do you see things in the future then?
"things can change very quickly, but presently the demand is very good."
in fact it's increasing the demand exceeds the supply at the moment.
it's small round cheeses that you make.
what's the reason for that?
"they're very popular with the tourists, i think they feel they are taking back a whole cheese a portion cut off a bigger cheese."
"and some of the markets that i supply, it's the hotel and restaurant trade that some of them go to, they like the small whole cheeses."
"they can put the whole cheese out on the cheeseboard, again i suppose to just a portion going on the cheeseboard."
"and i have packaging specially for the small ones, it makes them easy for people to post if they want to post them off to friends."
they're quite safe in their own packaging.
tourists that take them back they have the label on the box to say where they have purchased this cheese.
it's a an attraction i think .
come in.
oh  something that dr  did you not want to speak to the  team about john ?
yes i did.
they're on line one..
morning mrs .
good morning doctor.
"well now, what can i do for you today?"
i've been coming for three weeks now.
and i came to ask the doctor if i could get h r t. and she took my blood pressure and it was too high.
she chased you.
"so she didn't give me anything the first time, but she."
mhm.
the second time.
"the second time, it was a different doctor again, and she gave me tablets and i can't remember the name."
"it was  i just took the last one on saturday, and i then threw the."
aye.
"the wee white ones,."
aye.
right.
something.
aye.
so.
right.
show us your muscles.
let's see what you're doing to your poor old self.
"i don't know why i think maybe the, the tablets helped, but erm i was saying i was kind of having second thoughts whether i was wanting to go on the h r t or."
no.
no.
no chance.
no chance.
"not, not with your blood pressure up like that."
"no er well she didn't say much, but she."
"well, no chance i can tell you now."
whenever er.
just get yourself down.
"and i thought er and er i had wee tablets that you gave me a while ago,brusdeximit."
mhm.
and i was wondering maybe if i'd be better going back on them.
"aye, you'd be safer safer on them."
and they won't er they won't fight with your blood pressure.
here just let your arm .
"on second thought, it'd be ."
aye.
"it's, it's amazing how many folk come up to see about it, and they, they decide eventually not to."
doing fine.
you're fine but you'll need to stay on your wee tablets  i'm afraid.
and er i think you can forget the h r t.
"i will, i felt maybe er when i came up to see, oh i was having all these heavy sweatings."
just was it was really.
mhm.
mhm.
"pain up  sore back, so."
and.
falling to bits.
to bits .
"then i had another i had another wee problem that i'd been, i had been to see, and it was doctor  i had been, and the doctor that i saw the last time er i had three big bruises on my back, and she."
mhm.
says i don't know what this is.
but this was a wee sort of lump that i had down at the bottom of my vagina.
right.
"i don't know whether you would call it a lump or not, i said to her it was like a wee spot."
mhm.
"so she, she says well i don't know what , she says."
so i'll send you to the hospital.
so i've to go on.
yeah.
friday to see.
right.
doctor .
right.
now  have you got plenty of the wee tablets or are you finished?
"no, i finished 'em."
finished all that lot.
"right, agnes."
finished them on saturday.
"mm  that's how i was, i was saying  had been at the hospital, come back and says no, my."
no.
"tablets are finished, i'd better go to the doc."
"no, you'd better."
"you need to get that, need to keep that down because if you do go to the hospital, and they did decide to take that out, they would they would check your blood pressure and they would chase you."
there's no way they would touch it .
so.
"it's no, i don't really know cos the doctor says she didn't know what it was either."
"doctor  seen it first, she thought i had pulled a hair and it was kind of septic."
septic aye.
"and she gave me tablets,."
"aye, that leaves."
antibiotics.
leaves a wee cyst underneath the skin.
is that what it would.
mhm.
be then?
"yeah, that's probably what it is."
it it's no really er giving me any.
no.
"just, no."
"much trouble or anything , but it was just the fact of it being there."
it's there.
it's there.
and it's always a worry when you don't know what's going on.
"and the trouble is it can turn septic again, and put the whole thing sky high again."
but what about your dixevit are you needing any more of them?
i haven't got them.
i've no i haven't.
nothing?
been taking them.
oh well.
for ages and ages.
keep some in the house you do get a bad spell.
because they're they're safe.
would it no be similar to kept taking dixevit the other ones doctor ?
no.
no?
"no, they wouldn't affect your."
wouldn't do anything.
wouldn't affect your pressure.
no.
they wouldn't affect your pressure.
"they're very  they're good and they have very few side effects, this is the beauty."
aha.
"of the dixevit they keep the flushings down,."
aye.
and they don't affect your blood pressure.
aye.
"so, stick with them, if, if."
"you're having a bad time, use them."
if you don't  leave them be.
leave them be.
"but keep on your wee white ones every morning, agnes."
"one at breakfast time,."
"aye, er i."
er.
"oh well i took them, took them regular, because."
aha.
"you gave me only thirty,."
yes.
and that was enough.
that's right.
so.
"well, we'll see you in a couple of months again."
"er will i have enough to keep me going,?"
er yeah.
you'll have enough to keep you going for a couple of months.
could i get some  ?
there we are now.
"see how the boy takes  zantac doctor , is there two strength of zantac."
mhm.
and he's.
yeah.
getting the lesser one do you think?
would it be advisable for him to get the  higher one?
er.
he's.
"with the, with the bigger strength you only take one, they only allow you one a day."
mhm.
"he doesn't really, i think at the moment he takes one and er he doesn't take them like."
mhm.
constantly or er when he gets the heartburn.
er that's.
sort of thing.
that's.
he takes.
aye this is  this is the very strong one.
just .
"aye, just one of these a day."
when he needs them.
"i was going to put the thing in there, but i thought i would ask first before  you know."
he's still living with you at ?
aha.
hasn't run away and got married or anything?
"no, not till the sixteenth of july."
and he's not running away he's getting .
same thing.
same thing.
"peace and quiet,."
what about your own family?
you still got them?
yeah.
oh well.
"yeah, they're still."
still keeping you.
still keeping me mischief.
still keeping.
still keeping me mischief.
are they keeping you mischief?
ah well .
oh aye.
oh aye.
okay agnes .
"okay,."
"right,."
"thanks very much, doctor ."
cheerio now.
cheerio.
"this week our guest on sharing time is erlend  who is one of the survivors of the piper alpha disaster and is one who has come back to orkney this last week, staying with his family here in orkney."
"first of all, looking back on those harrowing times of the sixth of july, what do you remember about the incident  erlend?"
well it was at night and i mean i was lucky enough to be working which is a thing that's probably accounted for saving a lot of people .
most of the survivors were ones who were working at the time.
"and i was working upstairs in er what's called the gascon module, which was shut down at the time for repair work and things like that."
"and a call came over the radio that there was a problem with one of the pumps downstairs, so seeing i had nothing better to do at that time i went downstairs to give them a hand."
"which again is a part of the luck which probably saved me and er when i got down to the pump which was directly below where the explosion occurred, there was about three or four of us there and er as i said that the only indication that we got out it was a an enormous bang just directly overhead."
"and there was dust and everything went black, all the lights went out, so i mean from that we could ascertain that it was fairly serious what had happened."
and er we moved away to the side of the platform to get out from underneath whatever had happened and had a look around.
"there was nothing visible downstairs where we were, so immediately went up the stairs at the side to the production level where the blast had come from, and there we met a group of people who had just come the control room and they were cut and suffering from shock 'cos the blast had obviously well it nearly blown the control room apart."
"i mean the doors were hanging on their hinges then, things like that."
and by the time we got there we could see a fire round at the back of the the crane pedestal which was in b module where most of the oil separation plant is.
"and er at that stage we tried the fire hydrants but i mean there was no water in the pumps the electric pumps there was no electric power 'cos the electric er generator was blown to bits, well they weren't working anyway."
"and er the diesel pumps weren't on and er there was a couple of guys putting on breathing apparatus and trying to get in to restart them, but i mean by this stage the smoke was so thick they couldn't even find where the pumps were."
"you can hardly see your hand your face and er i mean there was no way to fight the fire, so i mean all we could do was stand back and look 'cos we were up there was about at that stage there was twenty or thirty of us standing in this north west corner of the platform."
and er the fire was getting that bad that i mean the smoke was blowing directly across the platform at that stage.
"and er take a couple of steps the corner you couldn't see your a thing, so we were more or less stuck where we where."
we could go downstairs to the sixty eight foot level  was er er fog horn and lighting system for in the fog it's a navaid system they call it.
and er that was a platform down there.
and off that there was a big knotted rope which was thrown down.
and er  guys started to go down that to the twenty foot level where they were picked up by an inflatable off the standby boat.
but i mean it was about twenty to thirty  guys as i said.
"and i mean as they went down we got the the diver, so there was a few of them there."
"and er the ones the control room they managed to get down  that stage we would be about half an hour after it, after the initial blast."
"and be about five or six of us left then, and we were just getting ready to get off when we got hit by the second big blast, which caused most of the burns to all of us then."
and at that stage it was too late to go down the rope so it was just instinct more than anything else that we just jumped over the side from where we were then.
and er after that it was just well every man for himself i never really saw any of the guys the one guy who was on the platform with me at the time.
i saw him when we got picked up off the i mean it was half a lifeboat we were left sitting on.
when we got picked up and he was on it with me then.
but i mean being in the water  i had no life jacket or anything like that so it was a matter of trying to keep afloat and er kicking off my boots and getting me overalls .
and er i mean it was all luck everything that happened to me that night anyway i mean it it wasn't so lucky for other people but i suppose most survivors have their their tale or so.
"fortune having smiled on them, and i mean if it hadn't been for a lump of expanded foam one of the life boats that had blown up at, if it hadn't come floating past me, i mean i would have been a goner , but i got hold of that."
"i managed to keep afloat then till, as i said we found this half a lifeboat and there was couple of fellows and er i managed to swim over to that and pull myself up on it and for there the inflatable off the standby boat came alongside, picked us up and put us on then standby boat."
at that stage then there was accounts of the sea almost being on fire with the oil and the mixture.
what sort of experience how did you find that?
"well i never saw the sea on fire but when we went into the sea i mean we were directly beneath the platform, and at that stage i mean the whole platform was on fire."
"and we couldn't you couldn't just swim on the surface because if you let any part of your body above the water for any length of time, i mean it just burnt."
"so i mean you had to come up, and grab a breath, and go under the water and try and swim it."
"which in the sea was pretty futile really, i mean you just had to go where the sea took you."
and luckily it just took us round the side of the platform and away then.
were there quite a few vessels around at that time that were giving assistance?
"well i can remember when i went was in the water at the start, there was you could see a lot of boats coming in alongside the platform."
but er it wasn't long after that there was another big bang on the platform and they all turned tail and went away for their own safety.
which was pretty demoralizing for us that were in the water at the time but.
so at that point then did you almost give up hope that you would be rescued? that you more or less were going to end in the sea at that point?
"aye, well i mean that there's there's so many things that go through your mind that in a situation like that."
"i mean you've got to try and keep yourself afloat, and then even that's not going to help you, if nobody comes along and picks you up either, so i mean that but i mean i i didn't oh well i  suppose i could say i gave up hope a few times but obviously if you the struggle to survive comes through in the long run, and i mean it's it's not easy to give up hope,."
"at that stage when you were picked up then, what happened the, where were you taken to after that."
"well we were taken the standby boat which is i mean every vessel in the north sea, every rig and installation has a boat that circles it, non stop, twenty four hours a day and i mean that the standby boat on piper i mean it was the the two inflatable boats off it that picked everybody up, and most folk up, and one of them was lost, they lost two of the crew off that."
i think that was hit by debris off the platform.
"but i mean it was it that we were taken to first, and i mean thee was a lot of people on it and i mean it had obviously saved a lot of lives."
and er we were on that for about an hour or so and then they got rid of the the badly injured were taken off then and put on the therris it's  support vessel that was just happened to be there at the time.
"and it and it's emergency hospital on it, and i mean they'd flown doctors out from aberdeen, and medics off other platforms round about."
so you were actually were you taken to pharros ?
for treatment  ?
mhm.
"i was taken here but at the time i mean i wasn't one of the really seriously burnt, i mean i was still conscious and i was still walking around."
and it was just me arm and me hand and me face that were were burnt and and at that the time i mean i wasn't in any pain and i think there was more serious ones to be dealt with.
at that point then you were airlifted back to a hospital in aberdeen.
aye.
it were six five or six o'clock in the morning i think i arrived in aberdeen at six o'clock.
to aberdeen royal infirmary where i were treated.
yeah.
"and there'd been quite a number there, obviously in that burns unit, who were suffering from the same type of er injury."
"well i mean it's considering the number of survivors, there wasn't that many that were burnt."
i mean there were only been about at the most ten who were suffering from burns.
maybe five or six that were quite serious one.
"i there was a couple that were really seriously badly burnt, and one of them didn't survive."
"when actually did you sustain your your burns, and you said that was actually on the second blast,."
"aye that was well that that was on the platform when i got me face burnt and me left hand, which i think was burnt trying to protect me me head or face at the time."
"i don't know how me right hand survived it, i mean it's quite good."
and er after that i think my right arm's got badly burnt.
"but i think that was when i was in the sea holding the bit of foam, and more or less just let myself float under the water, but me arm was round the top of the bit of foam, on the surface, and i think it got burnt by the the heat off the platform then."
obviously you were in hospital for a number of weeks.
what about the treatment that you were given in aberdeen?
did you find that they were obviously sympathetic to what happened and the spirit in the hospital would have been quite hight really?
aye.
"well i mean i can't say enough for the people in the aberdeen royal infirmary, i mean they've got a great burns unit there and i mean er er i think the plastic surgeons and what knot are about  they must be  some of the best in the world."
just looking at what they've done to me.
"and er they treated me there i mean i was about two weeks in a room on me own, and taken out then into the main ward for another four weeks."
"and i mean the nurses and everybody, the doctors were really great, and they give us the best of treatment there, and i don't think you'll speak to anybody that was in the hospital that'll say anything differently, they were really great."
"obviously with that number of weeks that you were in hospital, it must have given you plenty of time too, to think about future prospects in a fairly dangerous industry in the north sea."
what about your feelings now looking back on it?
do you think that you would like to return to the platform work?
aye well we've all spoken about it before and i mean when we were in hospital we spoke together about it and er obviously it's it's it's something you that won't really be able to tell unless you give it try.
"and i mean i would like to go offshore again, just to prove to myself whether i could or could not do it."
"i mean whether i'll ever work offshore again's another thing, but i would like to to try going offshore  i mean then again i mean i reckon i could work offshore no problem , but whether i could sleep on the platform is a completely different matter."
there would always be that fear that it a similar incident might happen and er and that er it was those who were asleep at the time who were unlucky enough not to survive.
well they wasn't the most unlucky.
to put it like that.
"but er  i mean we've spoken about it before, on the platform, and things like that, that i mean everybody knows the score that if something happens  if you're  if you're sleeping you've not got a an excellent chance, put it like that, i mean you er i mean nobody ever expected anything like what happened on piper to to happen any  on that scale."
"i mean we saw it ourselves, i mean you couldn't comprehend the scale."
"i mean i can remember being underneath the platform,being on fire and i mean i i just kept saying to myself that this wasn't really happening."
how about the the safety er precautions that were taken piper or in fact any oil platform installation.
it wouldn't have been able to cope with such an immediate diaster as as happened on on that night.
no i mean i i don't think what happened on piper can be put down to basic safety.
"i mean i don't think it was a gas leak, it wouldn't have caused an explosion to the extent of that."
"and at the time, i mean it's half past nine, all work had stopped, mostly at that time of night anyway."
"so i mean there was no poor operating but  this is going on, i wouldn't have thought."
so i mean it goes down to must be something like equipment failure which is something that nobody can really allow for.
what sort of safety training had you had for an evacuation or in fact a a slow evacuation from the platform while you were out there?
"well i mean, everybody goes to robert  does their off shore survival which takes you into helicopter survival and launching lifeboats off the platform and life rafts and er that done i mean you get your certificates and what not for that and everybody is to get refresher courses every two or three years, i'm not really sure which."
and then on the platform every week there's a evacuation drill where it's usually on a sunday night or a saturday night it was changed to recently.
but the platform general alarm goes off and everybody goes to their master stations by the lifeboat.
"and then they test the evacuation alarm then, everybody knows the alarms and er where to be and then every six eight weeks or something they take you for a helicopter evacuation where everybody's taken from the lifeboat master station."
taken the whole way upstairs to the galley where they go through their er helicopter evacuation drill then.
"but er all of that was negated by the fact with the amount of fire and smoke that was on the platform, nobody could get to the lifeboats."
"and plus the fact that with the control room had been taken out nobody could sound the general evacuation alarms either, there was no alarms or anything or any warning for anybody on the platform either."
and as you say at that stage it really was just a matter of erm every man for himself really.
"aye well that's it er i mean there was no, as i said there was no alarms for anybody else or anybody who wasn't there really wouldn't have a much of an idea to how drastic it was and what was going on at the time."
as i said you can't envisage or set up emergency procedures for anything as as drastic as what happened there that night.
i mean when your whole control room's wiped out and er you can't really expect anything like that.
"i mean unless you make the control room blast proof, which is maybe a thing to be looked in to in the future and then again they're speaking about making the accommodation module separate from the platform itself which is another thing, but i mean that's all to be looked at."
but whether you scrap all the platforms that are built in the north sea's another thing all together.
there has been some criticism of general safety precautions rigs and platforms out on the north sea.
"do you have any general feelings about that, do you feel that things could be tightened up?"
"i suppose there's always a room for safety procedures to be tightened up, i mean it's like in any place you work."
everybody's completely happy with the procedures that that go on.
"but er, it's difficult it's difficult at sea."
"i mean from rig to rig things work differently and i mean on on piper, i would say there were probably things that could have been tightened up but then again i don't think they were part and parcel of what happened and there on july the sixth."
the government has now said that they're going to order oil companies to install shut off valves below platforms.
do you feel that that would have solved the situation on piper alpha altogether or how far would it have gone to perhaps lessening the the blow of the the occasion?
"it's hard hard to say how much that would have helped the situation out there i mean it definitely would have helped in some degree, but i mean there was still all the oil that was present on the platform in the separators except those which were left under pressure all that would have had to burn."
"and er as i've said before, i haven't seen a a barrel of oil burning and the heat and smoke that comes off that you consider the amount of oil that would have been in the separators on the platform at the time, i think it would have still have caused an awful lot of heat and an awful lot of smoke and fire, and er just shutting off the oil coming back to the platform maybe wouldn't have helped that much."
but i mean anything in a situation like that's going to help.
"again, with the time that you were in hospital considering your future, what did your family think about your possibility of you going back out?"
"well i mean they've never really spoken about it one way or another, encouraged me or discouraged me, which i think i'm grateful for."
i mean  if there's a decision to be made i hope they'll just leave it me.
"i think that and i mean you go with the sort of attitude, that lightning will never strike twice in the same place, but then again i mean who knows?"
"clearly it was a time when so many people were lost, and it was the world's worst oil rig disaster."
"looking back on that then, you must have lost a great number of colleagues and workmates that it must give you mixed feelings looking back on it?"
"well it does, i mean it's it's i mean i've been there about just over three years, three and a half years."
i mean when you're working for a week at a time with the same blokes week in week out i mean you get to know them really well.
"it is difficult to to come to terms with the fact that i mean it's people that you've worked with for a week, at a time and i mean for three and a half years every second week you're working with that guys in a confined space, you get to know them really well."
"and i mean it is your sort of second home, and the guys that you work with every every week, i mean become, i mean it's a bit of a cliche to say, but i mean part of a family that you living out there that you live with out there and it is a real i mean when you think of the number that was lost, i mean there were a lot of close friends involved in it."
obviously having such a a close brush with death is something that you you've you've obviously lived through and be something that er you must feel strongly about.
do you feel that this particular incident has changed your attitude towards life?
i can't honestly say that now i've thought that much about it.
i mean i've only just come hospital and as it is i'm still fairly well macked with it.
"and you think that you're lucky to be alive in that respect, but i've never really thought that i was specially picked out for some reason to carry on living."
"but then again in the future it might sink in that  that there was a special reason for it, i don't know."
"obviously with so many having lost their lives on the disaster, you say that  you don't feel it's maybe an act of god int hat sense, that you were picked to to be saved, but erm you don't  feel any guilt as such either,that you were one of the ones and er so many others had been lost?"
"no i don't feel guilty, i mean i would i would love to see everybody that was on the platform still alive."
"but then again i think i would i would be lying if i said that, i wish it was me anybody else ."
"but no i mean i i mean i've lost a lot of good friends on it, and i would love to see them back alive but, there's nothing much i can do about it."
very shortly after the incident an appeal fund was set up and money poured in to that from various sources including the oil companies themselves.
what's your reaction to that sort of appeal fund?
"don't you think that perhaps it might have been better for the oil companies to have perhaps done more at an earlier stage, in the the safety side of things?"
or how about the the questions about an an appeal for for the victims and er relatives of the disaster?
"well i personally think with an appeal fund like that, i mean the amount of money that's gone into it is ridiculous considering the amount of compensation that everybody's going to get or hopes to get after it."
"i mean the only thing that an appeal fund like that should do is to give the widows and dependents of the the dead of the platform, it should give them immediate money to tide them over until they get their compensation which they need."
"and er the amount of money that's in the appeal fund, whereas it shows a great feeling of warmth from the general public, i think i don't i mean there's people dying all over the world, even at home here in orkney, there's people that dying, they don't receive any great compensation for that."
"and i mean i think that if it was spread more i mean if if if people locally gave more to to bereaved in their own areas, i mean it would go down more good there."
i said that the occidental are gonna they'll either willingly pay or they're going have to pay a lot of compensation to the bereaved and er  fund more or less just going to top up any money when it's probably not going to be necessary in the long run.
"at this stage then having spent so many weeks in hospital, how long will you be required to continue further visits to you know,update the treatment?"
"well i mean i i think the grafts that they've done, the major grafts anyway, are finished and er they seemed to have taken really well, so i mean it's just a matter of time, really, for them to settle."
and i mean they say with skin grafts it takes two years before they're completely settled and accepted.
and er i've got to go back next week for a sort of check up and i mean i suppose that'll continue for weeks to come.
"but er it's just a matter of time now for the discolouration to fade a bit, and things like that, that's mainly the worst that's left."
so in sense then that er the extent of your injuries really would not debar you from working offshore as far as you understand?
i've never really asked the extent the limitations of the injuries that i've got.
"i mean i'm going on the on the opinion that full function'll come back and i'll be able to do any work that i was doing before, and there'll be no change ."
the only problem is with er the skin grafts and that.
they say that i mean any changes any in temperature are very noticeable so like it is working in the middle of winter offshore would be something i would have to come to terms with but no i mean i don't think there's any problems work-wise.
i would hope not anyway.
clearly it has been a an extremely trying time for you.
how have people reacted and responded to your treatment and really erm how they feel about things now?
"well in hospital, i mean the number of cards and get well cards and well good wishes i received, and offers of help from people."
i mean there's people i hadn't even seen for years that were staying there in aberdeen came along and offered help.
"and everybody that sent cards, i mean it was really great  i mean get well cards are sort of things that you see in shops and you never really think about it, but when when you're lying flat on your back in hospital and you get cards for people, i mean it really does give you a lift."
and i mean i can't thank the people enough that sent them all.
and i mean there are too many to to name individually .
"but i mean it's it er it was great i mean the fact that i was i mean in in aberdeen i was home, i mean you didn't even notice it, the number of orcadians that popped in by the hospital and as i said sent cards and letters, it was great."
"well thank you very much erlend , for sharing time with us this thursday lunchtime, and we'll wish you a very speedy recovery and hope it won't be too long, in fact, before you're back at work."
thank you.
what what do you want to know?
can you tell me what your first er job was?
in the quarry?
what you were employed as?
oh er i i've only been erm i've only had one job.
"i mean er you know, i i was went in as a mechanical fitter and er stayed as such, getting bigger and more bilities as i went grew up."
that's all and then i i i was looked after the production machinery for about fifteen years  the top here.
"i was doing the the new developments  as the years went by , we didn't stay still ."
can you can you give me some idea of erm what it was like to start in the quarry as an apprentice?
well erm you mean from the day one started sort of thing?
yes.
"er  well er  one  went up  we we the fitting shop you see, was at ."
"erm the it was about i should imagine well guess, three years old back then."
cos two companies had amalgamated and built one fitting shop.
. the  works and the   people had amalgamated and so they used the one place where they had a fitting shop.
"did away with one at in  at this end, the new quarry."
"and er built a bigger shop, a more modern one."
"er one went, started work, very nervous, and er thought that everybody was putting a tape measure    and er oh to tell you the truth i i didn't know well i knew there was one apprentice been there about twelve months or nearly twelve months ."
they were younger than myself and er we'd been at  but er we'd been at  together.
we'd started at the same time.
"and er , one felt more happier after sort of meeting someone  you know because it's quite  and i was very shy at that  at that time."
"and er everybody there were only about what half a dozen fitters in those days and erm  er as a mark of their profession or trade in those days, they used to wear a white collar you know, with out a tie."
"and er  they er well er what shall we say,we we have got people introduced themselves and asked who i was and who my family was and all that's the usual thing you know."
was that important?
was that considered important?
"oh yes, they course there was then er er  relatives were then they knew there were some who knew someone  or cousin of whatever ."
i mean there were so many well really whole families working in the quarry in various parts of the quarry you see.
and erm those erm oh and then i was told put me off rather.
"er by the man who or one of the men who swept the shop and kept it clean and all the the the one of the labourers, that my job was to one of my jobs was to make the tea for the men."
so  that  put me off .
was it true ?
"and i thought oh yes, yes."
and fetch water for them to wash and that.
and erm so really three times a day i had to er make tea.
"er it took a bit of time to learn er you know the the rotation  who the to take the tea from various men's buckets, they was buckets, or wherever they had their stuff in their bags."
"and there weren't so many bags carried in those days as there were in later years, you know, the sort of er haversack thing."
and er having er knowing you know which and what time.
i mean if er that you you'd had it if if you ruined for life if you er took one man's see but served two teas.
"er say er yeah within say er two days or worse still, you could it the same day actually, because they used to have those erm er have you seen them, those an oval tin with two ends, er it was split in the middle."
have you seen them?
yeah.
i've got one somewhere in the shed here.
because you could i mean you could do the empty one  tin in a day really .
and er  tea and sugar.
"but the thing was that there was a mess room outside the fitting shop actually, but there wasn't much room there because er men from other jobs, er they from outside, used to go there and eat."
"so the our men er the fitters, had erm a table in the shop itself."
erm with in a corner sort of thing with a  thing around it and you know.
it was  well i didn't see much sense in that either but er i mean if they were eating on the er  eating on the job   didn't give you a break .
"but erm anyway, the erm and some of the men, used to go the older men, used to go and er to the smithy and cos er the our the fitting shop had a three fires at one end you see, where the blacksmiths were."
"oh they weren't  blacksmiths in in the ordinary sense of the word, they weren't quarry blacksmiths as such because they were more or less engine smiths you see."
yeah.
"they had to make and shape things for us well for  for the fitters, the machine and that you know."
they they were what would be called in the navy and that er engine smiths.
"cos they worked  they didn't bash er sledge hammers and things like a  shop and the gear for the quarry men as such, they cos that was the usual work of the erm the blacksmiths outside in the quarry itself you know, in the on the in the various banks."
"there was one, usually one blacksmith per bank really."
were these.
were these smiths still primarily concerned with forging?
yes.
were they?
"they they they did the the forge work and all that you see, and they looked after erm the er the inclined brakes what we call the brake."
i haven't i haven't seen heard another name for them really.
"erm they looked after the the ropes and er  there was one one blacksmith, where he used to go on his rounds and check check the wire ropes and the hooks and that on the inclines  you know."
test them for well that the insurance and the i suppose er the the the erm er what is it?
the mining er er you know the there's a a body which looks after the mining.
oh the inspectorate?
"the inspectorate er men i don't know whether it's the same as the one that looked after the coal field and all that, but erm we we had an inspector coming round anyway."
"and erm the the that was part part of their work you see,these blacksmiths."
and there were ooh a couple of what?
a couple of dozen of these brakes or more.
"no a couple of dozen,working at that time."
so they were kept really busy.
some of them were kept really busy just er looking after the brakes and and they they had to er check the er the erm hooks.
"they used to take the hooks off the wagon you see, there were two hooks, one each end of the the wagons that they used on the incline."
and then they were put they were er put er in the fire wire brushed and all that and looked and inspected for cracks you see.
"and  that that came round er  i mean they were stamped and er  the turn you know the each i i don't i don't remember what  what  they were examined, but er you know that was the law that they had to be ."
there were piles of them in the smithy anyway.
that had been through the fire and they were taken out and you know  whoever.
"and well, no, they were put on the wagons actually."
which were built in the wagon shops.
and erm.
can you give me some idea of some of the other trades that were represented in the er in the shop?
"oh erm  they erm  they did a lot of the work that were well they helped out , they they used to make wearing plates for the mills and that for the chutes and that."
you see.
erm  oh they  what else?
erm oh there were a thousand and one things i  i can't really erm you know they they were always they were at it hammer and tongs you know  they had er what would be called something similar to a steam hammer and you know.
did they?
"to do the job, yeah."
er you know the the they had a what was it?
"four hundred weight, pneumatic hammer."
so you can imagine the the the the the amount of heavy work that they had .
did they ever have a foundry?
did they have a.
"no er well, no er not not that i remember."
"but erm i remember er having i was quite interested actually, er there was er a sort of loft in the stores."
and there were patterns up in this store you see.
mm.
"and i but i couldn't get up at them, the the storekeeper  was fairly strict  with us youngsters and he used to chase us."
"but erm they were oh er wooden er gear wheels, of all sizes and such things, you know."
up in this loft say.
"so i don't know whether they'd been sending them away, to be er as patterns to some other firm or what, but there was quite a there was er a quantity of of casting sand you know  black stuff that you use."
"around the the the shop so, obviously they'd been either been casting brass, at some time or other."
obviously .
"they didn't do i i understand that the the quarries at  and and those places used to cast their own stuff, but erm  i i haven't i never heard of them actually casting anything erm ferrous anyway."
but erm the  what we very often did was er we used to run our own own bearings with white metal.
and we had er a special erm furnace for that.
"and er we used to run well most of our bearings, actually er white metal bearings and machine them afterwards."
"and er we cast during the dark days of the war,when toys weren't available, we  a few older blokes er apprentices used to i remember being at it for a couple of  hard week we had a hard week, well evening during the evenings anyway."
"er working, sweating like like er real steel men,turning out soldiers  and er  and erm somebody'd got hold of a mould of these er er toy soldiers you know, the old er lead soldiers that er."
yeah.
they used to come out in threes i think  moulds.
"and some aeroplane erm er  er what er i think they were if i remember rightly, they were the  er oh dear."
forget the name of the plane now for the moment.
yes well.
there were hundred of them flying round the end of the during the war.
"oh, designed for the coastguard."
er coastal command.
"oh dear, never mind."
"but we you know, one was one would be boiling the the white metal, we'd we'd fixed on the  and er  one would be boiling and pouring the stuff and the other cutting you know breaking up the the mould sort of thing  and piling the stuff out and as fast as we were piling them up, some beggar was  creeping in and stealing them ."
oh dear.
"you know, in actual fact, one of the men working in the in the in the carpenter's shop."
he was he'd been hurt that was the that's why some of the men did.
"he'd been er had an accident in the quarry some time ago and he was working in the helping as a mate or something   in the carpenter's shop  and he he must have been must have had his hands in our pile of finished products and er  well partly finished products and er he er he was caught one of the  cos er these castings  there was a an edge to them you know,the joint of the the mould that came together sort of thing."
they had to be filed clean.
"this beggar had come in to the fitting shop,corner at the back corner, where he shouldn't have been."
i mean he wasn't supposed to be in the fitting shop anyways.
"so the the manager our greatest enemy, we used to know when he started from the house  in the morning actually by  quarry  that er he was coming, but the on this particular day anyway, somebody had slipped up somewhere."
"and he saw this bloke you see, where he shouldn't have been."
er filing away.
and  he had this this erm casting of a plane you know he was cleaning up the  edges   gave the game away  then .
oh dear.
anyway we i think we supplied dozens of kids that had no toys during the war.
you know.
". erm yes well that's the only erm casting you know, that we did."
"bearings for for you know, shafts  mills really the old type crushers in mills that they were really crushers."
and they had to be the bearings had to be either you had to have a a set ready at all times sort of thing you know a spare set.
"erm yeah oh the bearings we we they usually were bought from they were american er brass bearings, huge brass things you know."
"they used to cost  about two hundred pounds in those days and that was a heck of a sum  in those days   you know  that sort of thing, how much they cost and had to be careful of them and all that."
"and erm the other crusher, the buchanan crusher up in in  here, the the the primary crusher, the american one."
well that that used to be sent away the the main bearing the main er jaw bearing  that was on the .
it was usually about six was it?
er somewhere about aye five five foot long.
erm that was sent away to london  white metal that that that was quite a costly affair .
that's the one that you see in this er book you know..
is that the one which was having the  ?
yes cuts in it.
yes yes.
yes.
and erm  the old chief that designed er er erm  a boring bath for it for boring that.
they they didn't they they just cast them roughly.
"well not roughly i mean they i mean they didn't finish them off wherever they was sent to in  whatever the firm i i i don't know the name of the firm, i was i wasn't involved in  didn't bother the job was done."
"and erm the he made a boring bath the whole block it it was a massive thing you know, that that that had to be ."
i should imagine weighed somewhere about  five six hundredweight.
the capping.
"cos of the design of this crusher affair, the whole weight was carried on the what could be the bap of the bearing you know, the bearing cap."
the whole lot  down you see.
oh i see.
"on the  on the  you there was only the  was only er three quarter of an inch centre sort of thing you know, but the shaft weighed ten tonne and you have this huge  and it just revolved and and the whole lot revolved under this cap."
"so the whole weight of the whole er the gear that actually sent the crusher going and made it so the jaws the swing jaw swing  and all that, was er hanging on the cap you see."
"it didn't matter, the other half didn't matter because it didn't come into contact really with the with the shaft."
and erm  the oh he'd made  i'm getting er losing my track.
but er he'd made er a boring bath from the chassis of a  steam engine.
there was a spare  one lying around   we'd finished er stopped using them  during the war  some time during the war.
cos coal was hard to get and all that.
and er gone diesel.
and this old chassis had been built up this bearing lay on that and it was turned by  and electric motor and all that and the boring bar went tool went and bored this bearing out and travelled along on its own  its own it was fed off course.
you know it was a quite a a brilliant idea really .
cos he was a brilliant man actually my my boss er my chief at the time.
he was the erm he came from anglesey.
and he'd been apprenticed in liverpool  with  a firm called  they were ship repairers in liverpool.
and er i suppose he he'd gone there when he was about thirteen fourteen and er he came from a family from where was it .
and some of his relatives they farmed but some of his relatives were blacksmiths you see.
so he'd had a well i suppose he'd messed around  helped and played about in the smithy.
before he even started erm when he before he went to liverpool as an apprentice.
but he was a brilliant man he was years his time really.
erm  ingersoll rand wanted him in america.
he was offered a job in america with ingersoll rand but he wouldn't go.
and erm he was by the way he was the er erm father in law of the man who erm  owned who was the erm building firm er in  er er oh dear they've gone now.
"it's just been taken over by you know, it's gone into the big big time er oh dear me, i forget his name now."
name of the man.
g  anyway.
oh er and er er he had a son who was a a dentist in .
john  quite a well known he was a very good dentist.
"i suppose he  he erm william, william owen  old chief."
he used to bring his tools up during the war  to er to er be seen to you know.
cos they they were hard to get .
. oh yes .
"and er one of the men that was helping the old man to to do something, to repair these tools you know, and he he'd gone to the stores to get something and leaning over the counter to get something er er to talk  as one goes on a on a counter he was leaning on the counter, and he erm  the the the storeman he was a tough little beggar, and he said, i've got a i've got a i've got a toothache."
he says.
"and  asked him you know, erm which one is it?"
and the other silly beggar opened his mouth and pointed to a tooth you know.
and he just dived in there and   and got hold of it these tools er once you get a hold of those things  you know they they're pretty they're fantastic you they won't.
i mean them they're designed to er they don't slip or anything.
and he held on the handle and he pulled the ruddy tooth out.
but he pulled  thing was sorry thing was  that he pulled the one the one that he had a toothache in .
wow .
"was tough, he's still alive in ."
er couldn't have done him any harm.
and er no but erm that's how the the old chief .
erm as i say he was a he was brilliant man er i mean we all we i'm about one of the last of the ones that were taught under him.
i mean we were very fortunate in having been er apprenticed under him you see.
"were you were you aware, before you went there, that erm you were going into you were going to serve under someone who was rather talented?"
well i'd heard of him yes.
"but i was er here i was one of the first people have forgotten that there was such a thing as a fitting shop in  you know, in ."
"and i started a fashion really in going, cos no-one had er thought of the thing for many many many years."
"and erm   later on let's see when the war started and i mean they wanted cheap labour and all that, there was room for apprentice."
several  boys went to the to the fitting shop you see but the i'd started i claimed to have started  i mean it's i mean there's no credit to me but i was the first you know i'd really started the thing you know.
where had they come from before then?
oh  usually.
yes.
yes.
yes.
they knew.
more about it yes.
was the well i suppose they had first claim in .
that sort of thing yeah.
"but they came with the chief being an anglesey man you see, they came from anglesey to  erm  they used to come a lot in  and erm as apprentices you know  and er aye no, the same old game again that er we in wales seem to inherit it's in i suppose it's in the b b c and everywhere isn't it."
"it's not what you know, it's who you know."
and er somebody's got a relative somewhere .
i mean  happened even even with the monarchy and all that   most welsh people ran ran england when they didn't have it really did they .
these families that left wales to help out with the tudor and all that.
erm i still er think i think they're still running britain aren't they.
gone way out i've gone gone through  to get to  to llandudno.
erm this tea making was a a er job there was a a break at nine o'clock you see.
cos we started at at half past seven.
"i used to catch a bus ten to seven, down when the  in those days."
never been late in my life.
erm the erm course the the blasting was on at nine.
"they used to blast, first blasting at nine o'clock, throughout the quarry you see so everybody had to go in so that was an excuse for a break."
about ten minutes break.
then  cos you had er  three warnings you got five minutes before and er then you had a the erm final warning and then the blasting and the they give you the all clear.
"i mean it took about ten minutes, quarter of an hour altogether."
so if these beggars up at the top  it was had been er thought out  had a break well er it was =right for the others working down in the bottom to have a a break.
so nine o'clock break.
"make the tea, go round the used to take about three helpings of tea to make the the  the bottle ."
"i remember we i had this sort of enamel brown enamel jug, ooh it was mm must have been  somewhere about  four."
mm couple of pints eh.
oh  more three pints i'm sure.
"er and erm i used to put it in this and go to  out into the mess room outside where they there was a cook and it was a very grand name for a person you know, a cook."
it's almost as grand as a chef these days isn't it.
the bloke who  sits  behind the ship in the chip shop.
"banging that basket he had they have,erm  and er  the er used to go there er and there was a or was it er er an i don't know."
have you have you seen them the boilers they used to have?
er.
"yes, half spherical,."
yes.
cast iron.
built er with bricks built round it and er a tap we used to have a tap on it you see.
and the cook in that mess room and the cook was always a youngster who started in the quarry.
"that's the way you started, up a ladder to the to be a managing director ."
a cook.
you know like like the  this thing about every soldier having a a a field marshall's baton in his  knapsack .
anyway erm they started at   well  you know quite an easy job but er their wage was about i i i i forget.
i i wouldn't know.
i think my my starting salary at fifteen was seven and six.
"that i had to find, threepence a day erm bus fare."
excuse me.
"and we worked six six i mean we worked saturday mornings you know, six o'clock."
"plus er  going up going to  you know, all that."
sos there wasn't much  left of the seven and six to feed me and all that .
and er i think after  and when i became sixteen that er had to start paying your your paying the union i had to join the union as a junior member  you know.
and er hospital fund and all this business.
anyway erm so you  .
our standard of living well our standard of living was alright.
i mean er didn't bring much home.
"and er the cook i think the boys had about er started on ten shillings  you know, ten shillings a week."
"erm but er that was this boy's job and then he used to er you know, scrub the tables in the rest room and  boil the water  first thing in the morning."
and er wash the cups and and he used to have to go running er down with messages down to  or down to the head office rather that we had an office in  where where our fitting shop was where there was a draughtsman's office.
"and a store, a store a sort of store clerk."
"cos we had other people concerned with the stores down in the head office as well, the buyers and ."
"and a couple of young clerks, that's where they bred their clerks for the future use sort of thing you know."
i see.
and this cook had to go down and carry messages back and forth and all  that was his job as cook.
not  he he couldn't handle a  a roast duck or er couldn't roast a duck or  anything like that you know.
or make orange sauce or er anything of that sort .
er and i don't think any other  most of them started and they're still here some of them.
er    still roast a duck  any more than i can.
well er not without a a book of instructions anyhow beside me anyway.
"er anyway the that was the cook's job and that was my job, i used to go across and fetch this tea  and have it ready by the time the men gave up work at nine o'clock."
"but er i used to go  i didn't eat with the men you weren't allowed to eat with the men you see, it was only the full men that sat round this table well."
that was.
half about eight of them you see.
"well it was the same  no distinction in that sense, but er you know we were they had more serious things to talk about than i er you know i knew the cook, er couple of other apprentices from the carpenters shop  we used to go into the main there was no-one to keep an eye on us  in the in the mess-room you see, no-one to tell us."
so we could play.
"and erm at the same time there was an old mill there , with an old er engine room."
which had apparently been a a steam there had been a steam engine turning this er mill crushing mill and er er i remember there was a name in in this engine it was queen of the valley.
and erm we used to go and play in that sort of you know  do the things that boys usually do.
oh we used to risk our necks walking across the ruddy this mill was a bit of a wreck actually and we used to go playing in places where we shouldn't have really.
"anyway, that's beside the point."
"but erm and then at during er before lunch and all that i used to have to go take a bucket and go to the smithy and erm as you may know, there's a a cooling er tank beside in the in er beside every every every erm blacksmith's fire and er you know to keep the er no no to keep the nozzle of the."
of the blower?
blower going you see.
oh.
how do you do?
how do you do?
hi.
"and this er and used to get hot water from this tank you see, lift it out with a ooh with some sort with a ladle actually."
er and er put it in the bucket and  get the right temperature.
"up my elbow    and er   anyway put it used to take it back to the shop and er well i was still inside the shop, down to a certain place in the shop and put it on a on a stand and then there'd be a on that stand, beside the bucket, was a a box of  not lux not lux soap  but er  yellow soap."
oh yes.
in welsh.
and erm slabs of it it had been cut like er it looked you know if you cut lard or something like that.
no you don't belong to that age either do you.
erm you know you get it in packets now anyway.
but er you know used to cut it er big chunks.
but er there's be lump of this yellow er stuff you know.
"and beside that again, another box full of erm well partly full  depended on what time of the week it was."
erm dust quarry dust and er  very very fine chippings you know.
so you got a handful of this yellow soap.
and er rubbed it and it was quite very hard you know.
and er put a dollop er dipped your hand into this the grit started rubbing   using the water we'd got.
some hot water.
and see my hands they they they're quite they're they're exactly like a er well shall we say an educated person's hand a person who's spent his life working behind a desk.
but you know it's funny how why  it was so i mean the grit and those were quite sharp you know you you'd have thought that it would have taken your skin but then it was ideal stuff for getting the grease the you know the dirt and i mean the the greasy dirt away.
it's easy enough to dirt .
that was the method that we used and i didn't i never heard i didn't hear of dermatitis or anything until well twenty five years afterwards.
erm i mean the  one could very easily have have got er some form of dermatitis with all the you know various oils and stuff that we had to put our hands in.
but erm  and all the old  mill  for milling that we used to used i mean  kept our hands clean anyway.
so that was one job and then we had big used to beg for a an old sack from the stores and open that out and er i used to wash them wash it and get it very soft and clean and hang that up and  that's the way used to  clean  and keep ourselves hands clean .
"and er but for all this, erm funny enough we we had er a fair in  twice a year."
"we haven't had one for oh many what fifteen, twenty years a er there used to be a couple of women used to come to sell rock."
about they kept the thing going their pitch going i suppose to about twenty years ago.
but we had a a spring fair in april and the other  in october.
i think so.
and the  fair was on the first of october.
somewhere round that time.
i i'd er you know  the older men would tell you.
"cos i i didn't go by fairs and things like that, i belonged to a different generation."
erm but erm come the time had come for for the fair let's say the the the spring fair.
i'd get quite a surprise because  very small number of men in the shop.
"i get about shillings eight and six, nine bob pocket money."
fair money they used to call it you see.
mhm.
"er  i know er perhaps i was er  civil or obedient  or whatever, i don't know  but er i i they they used to have this this collection for the for supposedly for carrying the water, i don't know."
but erm er it was a a nice sum to be to take with you to the fair .
you know.
er because it was more than a weeks  wages  .
to spend  evening.
and  used to happen twice a year and erm sometimes somebody'd remember my birthday or find that i had my birthday or and at christmas time we used to get some money.
"and this was a you know er i mean they were only what oh couldn't be more than about six  eight people working in the well not actually fitters but er you know, they were involved within the shop sort of thing."
"i don't know how many other people were approached in this collection, i don't know."
but erm they were you know they were exceedingly kind really.
yeah they were very kind too.
cos their salary well their wages weren't much.
they i believe  that er a craftsman's wage was somewhere  they'd a take home pay at the end of the fortnight.
"you'll notice that i say end of the fortnight, that was the settling time ."
er was three guineas.
was it?
it was one and three an hour.
the craftsman and fitter's rate in those days.
and a labourer's rate was eleven pence an hour.
mm.
what erm what what year would this be that you.
i don't nineteen thirty seven maybe?
thirty seven?
yeah.
mm.
yeah.
and erm  you know it was a a bad time really you know it was the thirties i mean people say it's bad now but er i don't think it's it's as bad now as it was then.
"i know the unemployment figures may be higher and all this business, but erm i mean er  a single person during those days, er say a young man in his teens, working would been stopped in the quarry."
"they were bad times, they used to stop."
er they were very fair er if i may bring in er this has nothing to do with my er well no it has .
"you know friends of mine, i knew them."
erm they were quite fair the in this quarry then.
cos if it was slack or anything they they used to stop the bachelors first you know.
i see.
"er you know i i i i mean after i didn't think anything of it, and in those days i was too young to think of things like that."
"but thinking back i mean they they were it was very good of them really you know,they were very fair."
er in the way that they and they well i suppose it was  the situation in which the quarries  you know or  and .
"and er the  foreman and bosses that knew people and they knew the circumstances and  i suppose they put a word in and erm you know men were stopped because er i mean, if a man had a house full of children or something, he'd probably be the very last  you know  before he was forced to you know sacked or and i mean they weren't sacked in a sense, they was always ready there was a place ready for them to come back to there."
but erm.
so.
laid off i suppose would be a  more appropriate way of of putting it.
it was it was generally thought of as being a fair system ?
yes.
in the main i i should think yes.
you know you know erm a young man  i mean it was er er reasonable wasn't it for a a single man to be laid off before a married man with family family responsibilities.
"and er generally er with families being larger er in those days, erm there'd be perhaps another couple of sons working or or something like to help."
make a family income you know or or increase the family income.
or so they could all eat .
"and erm  no well as i say, erm i think they were pretty fair."
i mean i i doubt whether firms would do it these days eh?
it wouldn't be considered fair today anyway.
no the union would step in probably and er  say that er last in er first out or some ruddy.
mm.
nonsense like that eh?
but that's the memory i have of it eh?
"when you went in as an apprentice, did you have any idea of what the job was."
what it entailed?
"oh yes, erm you know, having been brought up in a  you could almost say a quarrying atmosphere    that's the right er expression but erm i mean one knew what went on in the quarry you know."
erm  mind you it was really a step onto something else that as far as i was concerned in those days i meant o go to sea and er that was the best place you could have er to serve an apprenticeship because everything er i mean it was one of the as everything was starting to get specialized in in other works nowadays  it's gone completely now.
"but erm we had a sort of a  spectrum  you know it covered such a wide  well area if you like of er of engineering that one wouldn't have had a chance to to have a any contact with in in any other works, you'd be doing as one certain sphere you know  a certain type of work, and there you are you that's your lot eh?"
"but we covered everything you know, steam engines and diesel engines and oh crushers and construction work and development and  pneumatic gear, compressors and oh any damn thing that went going."
we made everything ourselves more or less.
and had a hand in  oh designing really there.
we were always taught this er comes back again.
"i think er you know this our our boss, er who  mr  as he was called he was given his full title of er  mr   william owen , then."
"i mean er much more should have been something should have been aye he's well worth er within the engineering world , well worth looking into his life really."
"because he he he's done a a you know he he he's been a a a a what shall i say, a well he's done a lot really to to to to to promote erm interest in engineering and all that and and he's done a lot in helping er to young men to become engineers and that you know."
he he he's erm really er the results of his his interest in teaching.
er north wales you know have have benefited.
firms in north wales here along the coast which came after the war .
can you amplify that if you can?
"well  as i told you to begin with, he he he he must he was a man was er years his tim really."
i mean and he he although he er he wasn't a graduate or anything like that i mean he he was a brilliant engineer.
his ideas are as i  they they say that he was er i don't know how much truth i  that he was the first that he patented and devised the first rotating drilling machine.
rock drilling machine you see.
cos the the the the they did have pneumatic drilling machines  quarries.
for ooh  from beginning of the century i suppose.
but they were only hammers in a sense.
they only hammered the they the the they didn't rotate.
i see.
"they just rammed their way and you had an man they had a man they tell me i've never seen one but erm  this was as far as i can make out er by the  they had a man standing by you see with a a spanner and er gave it a quarter turn every time it hammered the the drill sort of hit the rock, went into the and hammered."
they had to give it a quarter turn you see with a spanner.
but erm that  old the a and b we used to call them actually.
a and b. erm   there was no disrespect but a and b   and er he'd erm he devised a method he what he did he rifled the inside of the the piston.
"he rifled the inside of the the the the cylinder  and the piston was rifled , you know slightly ribbed, so as it went forward it turned you see."
came back and there was a er  it couldn't turn cos there was erm oh dear i'm forgetting my engineering terms but er you know it's a that's the .
and that's this is er i think i've already told you that he was offered a job with ingersoll rand which were the main er people that dealt with air and air products in the old days.
the american firm.
they tried to get him to america you see.
but he wouldn't go there.
william didn't want to take his overalls off.
because he he liked to work with his hands.
yes he was a heck of a man.
he could he was a brilliant machinist and er oh crikey i've seen him turn out a a three throw er crankshaft within a couple of days er you know without any precise measuring and and and in fact he just put his roll on on on a on the shaft he was turning and just gave him an idea i mean his eye was almost as good as many a bloke's measurement with a rule.
but er a three throw crankshaft for a bump you know  couple of days to erm  he was a heck of a man.
"and he we had i haven't told you er didn't tell you or i er don't think i've told you have i, that we did have a  a chemist in the quarry you know."
full time chemist.
would he be analyzing samples?
yeah analyzing  yes.
mr  his name was.
and he apparently was a very very nice man too er i mean he was i mean er er er er a nice disposition i mean yeah.
they stand out .
"and er oh he he was  he erm  during the war now come nineteen thirty nine and that stale period when er there was nothing doing really in france, between the time that er our expedition  to the to the maginot line and all that."
er  he went was a plane laid on for him and he was went over very often to advise them on fortifications on all their concrete fortifications in france.
did he?
yes yeah.
very well thought off actually.
and he designed some er i remember them being built.
erm air raid shelters.
built to his design under the rock face up at the top here in .
and er  concrete and all  stuff.
"and er  rock er dropped  use that expression, they used they were both right at the at the foot of the  quarry face or precipice or whatever  somewhere around a hundred foot high and then they blasted the top see and dropped a whole fall."
a fall is what we call you know a bundle of.
rock.
rock there.
ah excuse me.
and erm on this er  structure and obviously there wasn't a  everything was fine inside it.
"mind you, no-one volunteered to stay inside when it was ."
but erm all the intact.
ah.
can you er can you tell me where you were born mr ?
"yes in a little street it's not there now, down here called  street."
there were seven houses there.
"and only yards and horses stables and things  round there you know, in them days."
then we come in here it was a repaired house this was.
"this street here, in nineteen what nineteen  eight i think."
aye.
yes  it was.
aye.
how how many were in your family then?
well in this house?
yeah.
well my mother had six children but the first baby died and we ere there was another five.
"i think, there's only two of us alive now."
i've got a sister in er  colwyn bay somewhere she'd living yes.
aye   and last time i seen her was about five years ago.
"and the children's coming here aye,."
"ah all these, there was no houses across the road there."
there were yards of slate here to there.
that's on the other side of.
yes.
of  street here.
yes.
what did your what did your father did did did he do then?
he worked in  but he used to go and relieve the sailors and firemen in the steam boats he used to go you know.
when they were needed one.
"you know the man them was  they called him, always used to go and fetch him to go if they needed er or somebody lost their passes and ."
"er and i went there as a boy after  engines and things you know, in  then, do you remember them?"
"no, steam engines  shuntings."
"they were coming down from the  quarry, bigger engines."
they were bigger than this the ones they had shunting here.
there was two of them and they used to go all day at the quarry for to get bring the slates down to .
how how old were you when you started?
fourteen.
mm.
yeah.
well yes.
"i'm supposed just to answer you, that's all isn't it."
"well no you no you you say anything that you want to add, that will you know fill in."
all the gaps.
aye fourteen i was.
"i think i'd been yes a few weeks couple of three weeks perhaps in the slate yard behind  there, they used to make slates for schools there."
"oh there was about two dozen boys and a lot of men there, there was about a hundred working in that place then."
yeah.
"and then before that  boys used to go and gather cockles in the sand outside er not here, other side of  you know."
"and  bloody things here the whole time, these cockles were everywhere they were  we liked them, the boys did, aye."
ah.
and there's only me living you know .
i got er a nephew living in leicester.
arnold his name is.
and he comes here sometimes.
and then i just go about myself all day.
"perhaps to the beach  here, or  passing the time ."
cos i had  you see..
"when you started working as a lad, erm what did you have to do?"
when i went to  you mean?
yes.
before that other place.
that oh i was doing nothing there only tidying up round there.
"if a ship had been there loading, well there was a couple of us boys used to tidy up after er after the  and things on there see."
and we used to tidy up things like that.
er we didn't do much .
cos there were we were only getting about five bob a week aye.
aye.
and then er  like like that.
"and er i joined this territorials they come and then i joined them, and we went to camp parkgate for a fortnight."
"we were we hadn't been home a couple of two or three weeks  then the big war started, nineteen fourteen."
fourth of august so we had to go see.
we were belonging to the territorials then.
"and then we had to go there and we went different places, northampton,you know different places in the country like, in england."
and and in wales yeah we  forget where we were there.
but we went to had a lot of jointer then joiners men.
and we had to go to france then.
er belgium and france where i was in we were in .
and we had old naval guns.
old naval guns.
their muzzle was a long as from here to that door there.
about.
yes.
from here to that door.
about eight feet long?
yes.
the muzzle were  they had nothing else you see.
they wouldn't give us .
"i was a bugler, trumpeter with them."
"there was two of us on horses then, there was no motors then you know."
"no, only horses, horses dragging these big guns."
about six horses on them.
"in each gun, four of them."
yeah and then the horses used to go down out to the line see.
well the germans was shelling and these b things but we had sixty pounder guns then.
"they were very  short muzzle things, but them old things there like that, they were jumping when you were firing them you know."
they were  yeah.
"what what was it like when you you first went , i mean having been here in in  and then all of sudden finding yourself in france ?"
ah we feel oh we were we enjoyed ourselves there.
that's all i can remember ever.
yeah.
"but i come home, well  in the end."
"lots more lads were killed do you see, lots of them eh?"
well there was thousands killed see the infantry was and there were loads more all round you see ?
yeah.
"and all the country there then, well france we were first, then we shifted to belgium."
"nothing, only  and mud and dirt and everything else."
and walking about here some of the times in mud.
and we had on these shoes you know.
boots i mean you know.
yes.
". and the first trench we went in, the communication trench was ."
was it?
"aye  we was shifted about then, different places yeah."
and er  i had a touch of a there was a gas shells dropped somewhere quite not far from me.
and i had a snuff of that then  i wasn't right for a while.
i went down to boulogne to an hospital there.
got better they sent me back.
. aye.
. course my best friends were killed there.
"a a man named harold  from , and while i was in that hospital with that bit of a gas shell, he er he fellow came and told me there, to  boulogne that he was dead, killed."
aye never  they never seen him after.
a lot of them  getting killed there.
but i was lucky .
"i remember when after it finished, i went back to  for a while  i went with  ports and things like."
to different ships aye.
belonging to liverpool and them places like that.
"and travelling round ireland, travelling round ireland all all round it, cork all round with slates from here."
yes.
a  good life you know.
and sometimes  used to get a bit of a a bad storm ahead so we used to especially if you went from here to er north of scotland round cape .
in bad weather we used to go  into what was it they called long hope or something and anchor there.
er well there'd be a lot of us ships there then.
about a dozen there.
but we couldn't go ashore until it got better ad then we went round the cape  after and down into aberdeen see.
that's what we used to do  with these ships.
aye.
aye  got to bangor there and my father's photo's on that .
is he?
aye.
have you got them here.
no i they're in the archive.
aye my father's leaning on the bridge like that .
"i have to i i when i get to the office, i'll i'll i'll have a look closer."
"yes, you can see him."
the  like that.
yeah.
"on a bridge, it's like this wasn't it."
bangor her name was.
there was another ship the same as her called the  and another one called the harrier.
they had a few ships.
"they , you heard of her?"
i've heard of her.
shelling ship she was.
yes.
well my brother was with went with that one once a boy as a boy.
but i took him first to connor's quay to join a erm ship there.
i forget her name.
"well anyhow when we went there, i told er the captain like."
well what do you want? he says to me.
well i've been sent from bangor.
"there was a sailing er what do they call it, a  here  and it was him that he asked would could you send a boy there."
"so i took my brother who was younger than me, about four or five years see."
"the first ship he went in, he was  for about two years."
"and then he left her and he went with this   three masted top schooner she was, very fine ship."
aye.
and then  i don't know where he went after .
i went different places .
"i landed in the end me, on the railway."
bangor here.
did you ?
aye.
"yes well we i i'd been working on the menai suspension bridge you know, when they were doing the repairing like."
"i went there and asked the fella for a job, and he says, how are you on heights? he says."
"oh i'm alright, i says to him, i've been in ships and ."
"alright you can start, he says to me."
and i were i was doing the job there that's how i started on working on shore.
and er that job finished then.
and er i had a brother in law on the railway there.
so he told me to go and ask for a job there.
i went i forget er no i don't forget the name of the foreman.
jack  his name was anyhow.
"a bit of a rough chap you know, nice  but very rough ."
"what have you been doing before, he says to me."
i told him i worked on the menai suspension bridge.
"oh you're on  yes, go on, start tomorrow morning  he says to me, with fighting mack."
there was a fella called fighting mack there.
"you  start with fighting mack, in the tube there tomorrow."
and that's how i worked there.
er and then i think oh i was there for about two years after.
you so so you worked in.
i worked there two years after my time.
after er sixty five you know.
yeah.
and then i'd er finished then and miserable around here aye and in the town i used to get a job here and there.
then you know from someone or or other.
well now anyhow i there's only me here and i er was ninety three last birthday.
last september.
yeah i was born in eighteen ninety two see.
i think i'm the oldest one round here.
yes i think you are.
yeah i think so too.
i think so.
aye cos i remember a lot of old people here.
"a lot of old sailors you know er in them days, when i was a kid aye."
were there was there a great seafaring.
"ships sailing ships there were, haven't you seen the picture of them sailing ships."
"i've seen photographs but it's, to have people who were actually there is quite rare really."
"well the ships were there, there was no steamboats in them days you know."
"er only sailing boats and they used to be anchored here years ago, down on the beach there."
and they used to call on  when they were giving the turns  to go there and load.
my father was working loading  there.
er.
were a lot of people employed on them er from  ?
pardon?
"oh yes yes, you know, five and six in some small schooners yes."
but in the  was ten i think.
they she belonged to she was iron ship she was to .
yes.
and she used to run from here to hamburg and london.
with slates and about nine crew on her.
nice ship she was too.
my brother was with her for a  long while.
"oh he was a proper sailor, different to me you see."
what's the difference?
well er he started right.
started as a boy he did.
i and i took to connor's quay  as a sailing ship and i and then i hadn't been much in sailing ships.
i used to work as a boy i did on .
"and then when i got er old enough i used to go in the gang like the men, and er get the same and  piece work we were working loading the ships."
loading the barrels.
"and wheeling them to the ship you know, then after you'd been there a long time, well my father was a  down below and  i went to his shop then you see."
that's how we learnt.
so in the ship was a a nice thing you know.
cos slates you know  going and rolling round and jumping .
because they they weren't shifting do you see.
"but there's a funny thing, i was lucky in there."
"i was with pamela, she come up, new ship you know then."
"and i was with her till i left her somewhere in southampton, i'd been in her a good while too."
"somebody pinched something off me so, bugger all this, i said, i left her there."
and come home here.
"well i went to  in oh about twelve months after that or less say, and er she wanted a man there, i went down there and asked could i have a job back you know."
"well he was  just too late, he says, there's a fellow from  oh never mind, maybe a chance again."
she was lost all hands aboard.
.
in about a fortnight after it.
aye.
good good.
"and she was a new ship too, aye."
"she had a bad cargo see, they hadn't er some  stuff and they hadn't stored her properly and she turned over and they all got drowned."
"there was one chap with her, he'd been in  oh for years."
and his ship was  called .
he was from  and he'd been work a long time.
"willy, his name was, i remember him well."
he got lost and drowned with her.
he was from .
and and.
"aye, i'm lucky you see."
yes.
well i'm not to brag too much  i i've been lucky haven't i?
very lucky.
aye.
yes aye.
"and er this is what i do, well i used to do jobs  round here for a while or i've chucked it up now aye."
i don't get nothing .
cos i worked two years all the time i had a few bob for that extra  that's all.
"cos i can't get to what you call this thing now, social security."
the the guy can't get that  cos i had a few shillings more after working  two years .
oh i see.
aye.
that's not fair really is it.
no well that's the way the country's doing now isn't it.
"i don't think anybody works overtime now do they, over their age?"
very rarely.
"aye i should think so, unless they're working for themselves right."
"there is some fella he's working in his back yard and he's hammering all day, i i wish he'd give it  up ."
"but he's not out there today either, he started this morning, i can't hear him now."
ah.
you said that erm or you implied that it was important to stow the the erm slates very carefully .
oh  oh yes.
you had to store them.
"there was what they called gangs you see, you know they had planks didn't they."
have you ever seen them ?
i've seen photographs.
.
"and they used to two men on the shore loading, course there was men counting the slates do you see."
there was  thousands and thousands.
"and er then one man used to load the barrel, and the other man was to put them down the plank."
"and there was people from the town then getting a job like holding  like this and  fella on the stage you see, they weren't regular men, but they were getting a job and so much for doing it yes, just the same."
"but the the regular men were getting more money than  but er and then there used to be men down there, storing the slate, regular men on the outside, my father was one of them."
"say if there was eight gangs, there would be  eight eight of them there, and eight of them here."
aye.
storing them.
"packing them up  nice you know and chocking them tight so as they wouldn't shift you see, when the ship was rolling."
"when each gang, would they negotiate the er the bargain individually or would they be paid would every gang be paid a a flat rate."
a flat piece rate .
the the regular men were er mates sharing together you see.
i see.
"but the others that was getting a job from the town,."
mhm.
were getting the money what it was worth .
sometimes be more or less.
"used to be about few er shillings more do you see, er a tonne yes."
aye.
were erm only certain men allowed or er say were trusted with the job of stowing.
oh they were regular men.
"oh yes, they were regular men."
yes the others were only hobblers they called them.
hobblers?
"aye you know, holding them on the plank and passing them to the but the the men that were stowing them, they were regular men on the they knew how to do it see."
and they used to pack them up so nice and tight  till they were full up inside .
and then they didn't shift see.
no.
"when you started on that gang,what did you start as then?"
did you start as.
oh i started as a boy.
yeah.
"er on the doing small jobs on the quay there like you know, cleaning up and things like that."
after a ship .
"but when i got older,well i was getting the same pay as the regular men then."
piece work you know.
but the war come and .
and i was six years or something away.
er.
six years?
oh aye all through the war.
on august the fourth nineteen fourteen.
fourth  i had to go from here.
"my mother was sitting here on a chair yeah, when i come home from there."
"oh dick, she says to me, she called she called me dick and i used to tease her."
i thought  i used to i used to say to her sometimes i'll have to go off  story.
dick she used to call me.
i thought you named me richard?
"well i have, dick."
she says.
yeah.
"every time she said that, i used to tease her then."
aye aye .
but i remember once going er to school.
"now you go to school, the  school there."
well i was no bigger than this like and er  go to school dick.
"alright mama, i used to say to her."
after  been down there.
"and to  i went along that beach in them days you know and straight to the sea, playing with some wood."
"somebody had been her, fetching me to see that i was  playing truant,landed in school."
"well i could see a woman coming along the beach there, it was high up and  down there."
well this woman is coming like the devil if ever she is.  tell it was my mother.
and she got hold of me  by the neck like i told you to go to school didn't i.
"she says, look me right ."
and hammered on the door so  one of the and it was the class where i was too happened to be by the door there.
"and she says, here you are, here he is."
and do what you like with him she says.
and that's where i was aye.
i didn't play truant after that.
no i'm not surprised.
no.
yeah.
aye aye.
"the you said, that you were away for six years."
er in the war?

"but er i was going back to my own job  you see, and then i went to see if the and then i don't know what happened."
there was something er  oh well i went away again somewhere.
and then i went on the railway.
"the reason why i went there, my brother was living two or three  here."
"and he said says to me, i can get you a job on the railway, he says to me."

"oh well i say there was fitters, i used to er be handy with them."
"and lifting the heavy things and things, yeah."
oh it was heavy but i was used to heavy stuff on .
cos er when you're loading a ship you're you're handling yourself about twenty tonnes before dinner.
with your hands like this.
loading the barrow with twenty tonnes.
and and wheeling it so far like that.
and then the other fella will take it to the plank.
yeah.
to put them down.
"and he'd have to put that i remember one man that was counting like this, he used to count them by the three you know."
there was two or three men that did like.
they knew and they had a pin in in their hand to stick every hundred like that see.
counting three like that.
"thousands was  in no time, they'd count tonnes."
"and i put one morning,seven tonnes before dinner in."

who was responsible for for calculating the number of slates then?
oh there was a they had er er er counters they called them.
but we called them  in welsh do you see.
they say there was oh half a dozen counters there you know.
but there was one man in er in you see them little red huts that's on ?
he was there.
"he he knew how much every ship carried you see, and how much slate they wanted to get rid of there."
"aberdeen, different  slates going there."
they were thicker and smaller you see.
because the weather was bad there wasn't it.
i see.
"but in ireland, dublin and belfast, the lovely best slates you know, used to go there, to ireland."
best slates.
scotland there was different place altogether for slate.
aye.
and they used to count it like that  and every hundred they stick a pin in see.
"and they had a slate in their hand, square slate like this."
"and they used to mark the hundred and then go  there again, take the other pin out and go like that you see."
counting them all the time like that.
yes they counted thousands of them.
well they  they knew how to do it didn't they?
they were used to it.
"they had a say there was two or three counters, this man in that part had made the cargo already before they started see."
"one man er that had so many hundred apiece or so many sizes say, different sizes ."
and then they used to go with their slate and and they knew it altogether  and then the counter turns and turns like that.
and they don't do it now.
they made the rope.
how the ships finished here.
"they belonged to they were  ships you know, but they had one sailing ship, the  herself, they made a road into  quarry you see."
"and a ship going from here to aberdeen,she might be a fortnight going there, with bad weather ."
"going to different places, windbound we used to go."
"because we boys used to like the windbound  lying and talking and in the galley and smelling of the  coming from the galley, all the saucepans and things like that."
you know.
aye .
"aye well you see it  we used to  it doesn't matter how she jumped and rolled, we were eating just the same."
"but if a young fella started you know, he couldn't eat you know for a while long time."
"he got sick do you see, and lie down."
yeah.
"and we used to say,you're alright, come one."
we've been the same  before when we started.
. aye.
yes aye.
how long did it take for your stomach to settle down then?
oh a good while.
yes?
yeah.
you were afraid to see her shifting.
. oh yeah  all the time.
"we used to tell well the old men used to tell us, you'd be alright  used to it."
but we used to tell these young when they erm young ones come when we were going all .
aye.
i remember one fella  she was rolling and i was  in the galley.
"and with a frying pan full of some stuff there,very nice though."
and he come there and luckily he went the table to lie down .
"he had to  and sick, he was vomiting see."
well  we used to get a bucket and throw it over the over like that.
and the old men used to do it before us aye.
"you'd go you wouldn't feel it , you'd be in your glory there after after about a month."
i used to be all the lads the same age as me there.
yeah.
and then down here was all sailing ship there.
well do you see the photos of them on that  has she.
i hope.
she has yes.
i hope she's bringing them back aye.
well she will  up there.
. aye.
"they're not new houses there, they're not very old are they?"
"not relatively speaking, no."
no.
oh these are old but these are er second repair these are these two.

this was a terrible place in them days aye.
all kinds of more people living here very old you know then.
yes?
yes.
yeah there were.
i remember them  eighties and  nineties here.
and they used to work.
well they had nothing after like.
there was no dole or nothing like this they had.
there were only workhouses and like that for some of them .
how did the old ones.
eh?
how did they old ones survive then?
well god knows to tell you the truth there.
"they were er  well they were different to us, they weren't going nowhere from here and er they had no best clothes only same clothes mostly for days and sundays isn't it, same."
er there were some like  look here tell you what's made the difference .
"i remember well, ten pubs in here, round this quarter."
ten.
good heavens.
and there's only two here now see.
there in  and er where's the other?
"on the beach there, the ."
oh yes.
and that's bigger now.
"that's that used to be the part there that's gone big there, was sailors ."
"was given it i think, all the sailors used to old sailors after they gone too old, was going in there all the day and a big fire there."
well i've been myself.
"going there, big fire  used to smoke pipes like that, in there."
there used to be  used to shunt them out didn't they.
and the lads were glad to go there.
"well i wasn't married but i used to go in there and i used to come home er say in winter if i come home for a week or two, i go in there, and sit by the fire and have a yard."
and they tell us which boat  old men been and what see that's how we learned didn't we.
i see.

what happened when things began to to go down the ships then?
oh everybody was going poor wasn't they .
"some  well i myself i was lucky i had a job with my brother in law, he was working there on the railway and he knew them well."

"as i say er it takes a bit of getting used to when you're just making a meal for yourself, you know what i mean you're you're that used to carry 'em about and picking after 'em and."
holiday.
a holiday at home.
"i'm holiday at home, yeah."
i've lit this i've got me dog so i'll be alright.
she.
now then.
she won't let anybody touch me.
what do you want to do about these?
because.
well well what you.
do you find they work?
"well do you think they're alright, i mean er."
"are they are they helping you, when you take them?"
"well er they they're helping me,."
yeah.
"but they're apt to make me feel i suppose that's what they're for, docile like, you know what i mean?"
"yeah, well what we."
but er.
yeah.
"i i you know i cope with them alright, i i i  as you can see doctor how many prescribed."
i mean it was october when i come and see you last time.
november actually.
oh well that's.
"when i had prescription, and er."
i think i think we've got er three choices.
"as i say er i only take them when i've got to take 'em, you understand what i mean, but i shall sit there and."
yeah.
something'll just come into me.
yeah.
"mind, you know what i mean, and i get."
yeah.
panicky wondering if.
yeah.
i can think it out.
yeah.
i know it's daft.
might think about a commercial what's happened years ago.
yeah.
"it just seems it flashes in my mind, i don't know it i think i've always had a had a overactive mind, actually, you know i've always worked."
well.
and.
we could put you on something on a regular basis to help to damp them down.
mm.
but you weren't very keen on that.
"no as as i say doctor, i don't same as i was on the valium, you know."
yeah.
"what i mean, i i i don't know whether that's a throwback doctor from er being on them, i don't know."
i think they call them flash backs don't they or something .
"yes, that's right."
"but as i say i cope alright with them and as i say doctor, i always seem i wake up with one, do you."
yeah.
"understand what i mean, so."
well.
it must be in my dreams or.
"or what we could do, if you say these this dose makes you drowsy, we could give you the same stuff but in a lower dose."
mm.
and see if that will help without actually making you.
you feel too dopey .
"feel flaccid, as you say."
"is that okay, shall we try a lower dose?"
yes please.
now if you find the lower dose isn't working then we can always go back to.
well.
this dose.
"describe them again doctor, i i cope with them, i only just take 'em when i've got to do ."
what this dose again?
yes please.
you don't want to try the.
no i don't want as.
"i say i don't take them for sake i mean as you see how many you prescribed for me, can't you?"
okay.
but er.
well i shall give you thirty.
yeah.
er and that'll last you about a year.
yeah.
and that's fine.
and this is really the ideal way to use this drug .
mm.
"it's a very good drug when used properly, and that's exactly what you're doing."
and.
"yeah, yeah, yeah."
and half the time.
as i say i don't want anything on a on a regular.
"yeah, yeah."
basis doctor .
not same as the valium was.
yeah.
"because you get too independent of 'em, you know what."
that's right.
i mean?
yeah.
i'm independent not independent.
yeah.
i getting me words  up .
just when you need it.
and we only give you thirty anyway.
yeah.
"as i same i'm i'm you know, to be a bother like, but i thought well i'd be  best to come up and see you i could have just have asked for another prescription ."
"well no, i think it's sensible."
yeah.
to see you.
yeah.
just to see how you're getting along.
"yeah, yeah ."
and make sure there's no other.
but.
problems that have.
me heart's alright isn't it?
i mean you know  me heart.
as far as we know you're blood pressure and things have been fine .
me me heart's going nine to.
"dozen as me mam'd say, bless her, but er."
you know what i mean.
that's right.
"and i think er i think it's that what worries you sometimes, you know er er if it can stand the pace, but as i say."
that that's it.
okay.
yeah.
"all being well, we'll see you."
yeah.
"next autumn or so, next summer."
"yeah, well if if i want you, i."
yeah.
"know i know where you are, doctor ."
you do you do.
yeah.
thank you doctor.
"that's okay, nice to see."
yeah.
you.
good evening.
hello.
hi.
what can i do for you?
"right, doctor i'm here for a er prescription for endoril l a."
pink?
pink capsule?
"well i'll tell you  i, i, i was here last month and you know doctor ?"
mhm.
she said she would put on the computer or something like.
mhm.
that for three months.
yeah.
now i couldn't quite remember.
she told me to come back to get my blood pressure checked again.
right.
and i couldn't remember whether she said at the end of the three months or.
end of the month.
just now?
i'm not quite sure.
every month june.
basically that's why i'm here.
mhm.
for the prescription and to get it checked.
slip your coat off and we'll get.
the pressure checked for you.
ah.
.slip that round your arm.
that's it.
right.
that's okay.
there we are.
there.
just let your arm rest on there.
doing very well.
"you're not getting any funny fits from that , june?"
er no.
nothing?
ah.
that's excellent.
excellent.
no problem.
"it did mention  in the, the sort of packet that maybe  feel cold with cold hands and what have you."
but i think i could live with that.
i haven't actually noticed.
that there's.
aye.
you'll find.
no.
that's really only a problem in the winter time.
aye.
you will be getting very cold weather.
aha.
during the winter here.
you know a lot of frosty weather.
a coincidence cos at the time i started taking them  actually trying to spare my branch  work in a bank.
mhm.
so i was trying to spare  and it's really the most coldest branch i've ever been in.
mhm.
"er the heating had broken down and i don't know whether it was  the heating or the tablets or whatever but they're, they're alright now."
yes.
well i think er the time that people notice this most is definitely in the winter.
aha.
you know if you get maybe a week of fairly hard frost.
aha.
you feel the tips of your fingers.
yeah.
"cos it'll actually take me till about half past  the day to get any feeling in it, but as i say."
i don't know if it was the tablets.
"it wasn't, it definitely wasn't the tablets because if, if it had done that to you, it would have been all day."
aha.
there'd have been no improvement.
i see.
aye.
because it works all the time right.
aha.
through the twenty four hours.
right.
"so you wouldn't have had any, so it couldn't have been the tablets  doing that to."
you .
if it helps my  blood pressure i could live with the cold.
yes.
oh yes.
fingers .
oh aye.
oh it's doing really nicely.
and we'll see you in four weeks again.
that's fine.
and get it checked again june.
okay.
okay.
thanks .
there we go.
right?
thank you.
bye bye.
okay.
right.
bye now.
are you?
yeah.
well that's what i've er she said i've got to come and see you first.
"oh i see, right, that's fine, yeah."
"right, let's have a look, whereabouts is it?"
i've got two actually   there's one there.
ee.
"it's er, yeah that should be fine, we shouldn't have any great problem with that."
"yeah, the other one?"
"the other one is this high, that's a."
"yeah, well we could do the same with both of those."
"they're both, they're both, neither of them are actually warts, okay?"
they're both rather fleshy skin tanks.
skin tanks.
"there's two ways of doing this, you can either put some local anaesthetic in and actually burn them off, but that often leaves a bit of a scar."
or you can actually try freezing them to kill them and then they just drop off on their own.
and that's.
mm.
probably the neater method of the two.
and certainly the easiest for you.
"erm i'd probably give it a go on freezing first, the only thing about the freezing is sometimes it doesn't work first time."
but that'd be the tidiest thing for you.
and we.
mm.
can get that set up.
"now i'm actually, there isn't another session now until the week after next, cos i'm actually away next week."
mm.
"er er but then we'll have more sessions booked in, we can just slot you in to one of those i should think."
yeah.
"there's someone away all august but i'm actually going to try to keep the sessions going,."
yeah.
cos there's actually quite a demand for them.
yeah.
well i'm away.
so.
er twenty second of august again so.
yeah.
"er what will you do, let me know?"
or.
"no, what we'll do is go and actually get you booked in."
oh.
"so twenty one, where are we?"
"twenty first, so if we got you booked in for that."
follow.
me.
yeah.
follow me.
as i said we may not have a  set up but if we haven't we'll set one now.
could i have your name please?
", harry ."
how old are you mr ?
ninety two.
where were you born mr ?
"yorkshire, morley, yorkshire."
when did you come to live in north wales?
erm september nineteen eighteen.
where did you work in llandudno?
the er for the electricity the the council electricity supplier.
and where was that station ?
"that's down in erm er i don't   it's where the gasworks is and that's on erm  i don't remember the road, the other end of the town."
the gas the the gasworks and the electricity were both together.
i see.
was this during the early days of electricity in the in the area?
well the electricity er er was originally er in nineteen hundred.
yes.
there when the er first electricity station was built.
it was in er going order when er i came.
i see.
there were it  came under the north wales  electricity supply.
yes i see.
and that supplied the coast.
i see .
more or less.
with the hydroelectric stations.
i see.
how many people would be working there with you at the time roughly?
would you remember?
in the electricity works?
yes.
"oh  with the distribution there'd be like like over twenty or twenty five, twenty twenty five."
what was the nature.
mr er er er mr er  and er  er  his assistant was .
and then there were these shift engineers and myself  er and the boiler room staff.
what was the nature of your work?
what sort of things did you do ?
erm maintenance on the engine room and boiler room.
i see.
on the plant.
where did you live in llandudno at the time?
er in erm here in  road.
and then er  no i beg your pardon that's wrong.
i'd been away after that before i came to the electricity works here.
i was working in burnley putting in a big textile plant in.
i see.
and from there er in i came back here in nineteen thirty eight.
and should've gone  abroad but i wouldn't go i er i er i had this position offered in the electricity works here then.
aye.
nineteen thirty eight  and i i was here about ten years er the nationalization was in nineteen forty seven.
and i er i went then when the it was a nationalized  this station was closed down and i went to dolgarrog power station.
i see.
and i was there till nineteen sixty  when i retired .
i see.
did you have to travel from your home here in llandudno to dolgarrog to your work or did you  ?
oh yes i went on the bus.
er travelled on the bus.
did you?
i got many a lift you know with  someone that were there.
how many hours a week.
but i i stayed in dolgarrog the first two years.
i see.
to be near hand because i was on maintenance on call you see as maintenance.
i see how was the electricity generated in the  llandudno power station?
well er there were erm  reciprocating engines and generators on a positive shaft right through.
"but then you see  the town was on er on er on d c. and they'd be at that time they they were beginning to change over to a c, the whole country's a c now."
and to get onto the grid  supplied by the hydroelectric stations.
i see.
and so they put three sets of converters in.
that was to convert from  from d c to a c.  to bring it er from a c to d c to bring er bring it into what the town was er being constructed for.
i see .
that was until the grid got into proper operation and the then they got nationalized then they they transferred back onto a c.  it was to bring it into line to to keep the town supplied through all the er cables that were were being constructed for d c. they had to bring the a c back to d c.  that was converters.
now there were three sets in the electricity works here and two in the substation down the town hall.
and the converters is that the er  commutators on the converters got in a bad state and er the the er mr  asked me what could you do with them.
"turn them mr , never heard of it."
i said i have.
i says and we'll do it.
oh yes he says you you get on with it.
so i did.
was it.
i.
dangerous work?
"no, no."
no?
oh no i couldn't .
i designed and made the drawings for some jigs and we made them  i'd two or three men with me and they made these jigs and  them underneath the sets.
"and then  took  er took the took the the erm  took the the saddle off and the lathe and and fitted it on top and then got special tools from clarence dock at liverpool power station  that i asked for,tools."
and they turned these  they got grooves in  where the brushes fit.
"now they should be be perfectly plain, straight and we got a i got a true cut on eighteen inches with a a  mr  was so  so he made a special report on erm what i'd done."
and i did the three sets in the er electricity works and the two  in the substation.
and they were a complete success.
so how long were you working in the llandudno power station?
twelve years.
and where did you go from here?
dolgarrog.
what  powered the generators in the dolgarrog  power station ?
oh er that's er that's erm hydro  water.
i see.
oh yes that's  that's er more or less  well it's the nearest approach to to  to er  what do they call it?
oh perpetual motion.
it's continuous  the water.
water comes through  it starts er er from er   on two machines.
high high high pressure  and it travels three miles   is three miles long and a mile wide and they've never touched bottom.
it's fed by underground springs.
"and when the heavy rain's heavy er it rises you see, well you've got to put more power, switch more power the machines down below in the station."
"we've got three sets, we've got four now  there was another put in that one when i when i was  i ."
that that one we put that in when i was there.
i see.
that   a francis turbine and erm  er the er  generator  that's a positive .
the water hits it you see well it isn't like steam.
i've been in steam stations steam turbines a long time since but with steam you can use it over again.
yes.
passes through condensers.  er and that er  and then through the er through the coolers and it its got back into the boilers at the proper temperature.
"but with water  once it's hit the wheel  on the turbine, it's finished."
yes.
but it takes it er at at er with a pressure of five hundred pounds a square inch.
as much as that?
yeah  but you can't get speed on  on water turbines that you can on er steam.
now steam there's steam turbine er the the revolutions are are three thousand to the minute.
now on water you can't get them only on eight hundred about eight hundred and ninety.
or eight hundred or eight or nine hundred.
how was the water conveyed down ?
through the pipes.
i see.
how many pipes  ?
nine.
they're nine foot diameter.
are they as much as that?
er  coming from dolgarrog from  when they start.
yes.
and then there's big  mesh  wire meshes  to stop any foreign matter coming through.
they start at nine foot diameter.
yes.
and by the time then the er diameter's reduced all the way in three miles and the the the drop is the drop is twelve hundred foot.
that's  down the mountain side.
the last drop.
and when it hits the turbines it's the diameter's ten inch.
so you can imagine what's coming er pressure's coming.
yes.
all that weight of water's coming through all the time.
what was the.
and then it goes it it runs away into the the the through the er  bypass into the er er river conway.
now you said the pipes were nine feet in diameter?
yes.
what's  were they made of metal?
metal pipes?
oh yes.
how.
high tensile steel.
high tensile steel.
oh yes.
how thick was the steel?
er   inch inch and inch and three quarters.
would be  well you can see them pipes.
and then there's flanged  they're every  six er every er twenty two feet i think it is.
and then the the flanges.
the flanges are two and half inch and then they're bolted together er corresponding er fluctuating bolts one after the other.
"all the way round and those bolts are eight  eighty, eight by one and half and two inch."
were these pipes examined  by anybody?
oh yes.
periodically or daily ?
oh yes erm    er  er the hydro-electrical engineers  london.
they're the consultants for the hydro stations.
but you know what they're getting now.
er it's er ffestiniog.
all that water that goes that goes down through the machines is all sent back to top.
recirculated?
er oh yes er the er it's it's a permanent shaft right through.
i can show you it.
it's a positive shaft right through.
and it er   and the pumps  the pumps at the bottom  are one hundred thousand horsepower.
really?
that sends the water back to the top.
this is what it looks like.
that's the pump storage.
i see.
there's the there's the turbine  here  and there's the generator and here's the pumps.
i see.
that sends it back back to the top.
that's the dynamo there on the shaft isn't it ?
"yes, yes."
yes.
yes.
i see.
that's very interesting .
they take er they take a bit of if you'd like to take that to look at you can do.
thank you very much.
i'll bring it back i'll keep it.
er.
safely for you.
there's no hurry no hurry.
thanks very much indeed.
it's very interesting .
well in fact you could keep it if you want.
no i er.
i can get another.
no i'll bring it back for you.
i can get another if you er.
no it's.
.
but er it   it'd take a bit of time to er if er i explained it all to you.
yes.
how it's er how it's operated.
"you see the the inlet pipes and the outlets  and this you can't see a thing of this, you ought to go and have a look at this place sometime ."
i'd like to very much.
i'd like to.
did these pipes ever break?
mm?
these these conduit pipes  did they ever break ?
no.
no.
was there no accident with them ?
too solid  constructions.
this this is the main this is the er the station that was only opened in nineteen sixty seven.
i see.
you can take that if you want.
er er.
oh thank you very much.
now er in the in the   an engineer if you've any engineer friend engineering friends i could explain it all to you but it takes time.
yes.
if if you've if you've got  they'd be able to explain that to you.
because it's all  it's all set out.
er i take the the er dynamo itself in the powerhouse was erm.
well they aren't dynamo er a a dynamo's obsolete.
mm.
they're er generators.
i see.
generates the current.
how how was the.
it's like like this you see.
er er er it's it's one magnet working against another.
i see.
is there a coil of wire round it?
er oh yes the lot.
"you see the out the er the rotor  and then there's the stator outside, it's massive coil millions of thousands of miles of wire."
and then there's a gap between you see.
the higher the the voltage the closer that gap is.
"you can't adjust it, it's way it's originally designed and made."
"and that produces the the er electrical you can't see it but we know that, everybody knows."
you can't see it but that's where it's generated the those two.
that's  now it's it's it's working  the  is working against  the power.
"you see   you see that's the generator  and these are the these are the coils, that's the rotor that goes round."
i see.
and the electricity's generated in the centre.
this is all the apparatus that goes up to drive it.
"and then there's governors and all that sort of thing to regulate it, to keep it exact."
to keep it in its place so all the engineers knows what they're doing.
anyway if if you've any engineering friends they'd be able to explain that to you.
i can do it but it'd take.
thanks very much.
a long time it'd take a long time.
ooh aye  er it's it's er highly technical  and i.
yes.
i mean i i it's a long time since i left it.
there would be somebody on duty twenty four hours a day ?
oh yes.
"continuous, they never stopped."
it's a public what they call er mr  here used to say.
it's a public service that must be kept going.
they worked all night sometimes on breakdowns you know.
they're inside boilers  and the coal passing through you know.
"but now in these big new super-stations like drax in north yorkshire, one of the biggest stations er in europe, coal-fired and ferrybridge  in cheshire."
you see the coal now is pulverized.
the it comes straight from the from the er mines and it's it's sent through chutes on these  merry-go-round railways that go slow and they stop over this  and then it's all pulverized with heavy steel balls into powder and coal and into the furnaces it's just blown in.
at a terrific pressure.
and that's the furnace that creates the steam and the steam goes then to the turbines and a matter of half a million er  drax  drax power station and ferrybridge  their units are half a million horsepower   half a million or six hundred five hundred million horsepower.
tremendous.
i used to have a little stick.
cherry wood.
oh i did all my all my working days i i used to keep it keep it in my pocket you know.
and er i could yes i could hear well then.
"i could put it in it were only about ten inches long and i i made it and tapered it erm on a lathe, i put it my ear and  side of casing and i could hear all what were going on inside."
if there were a fault i could detect it.
is that right?
aye.
they've got instruments for doing it now but i used to stick to my bit of stick.
"they used to say, that bugger's coming here with his bit of stick."
he knows more about it than what we know with these instruments.
how they used to talk.
it was a primitive form of of stethoscope ?
was this thing going then.
when i said that?
i'm sorry er what were you ?
it was a primitive form of stethoscope?
like a doctor's stethoscope.
yes yes.
or er i used to use them too.
did you?
"stethoscopes, yes ."
did you really?
oh yes.
but i used to i er used to stick to my bit of stick.
i got better results than what they did with their with their fancy gadgets.
what else can you tell me about er the generation of electricity in dolgarrog?
ooh i could tell you a lot.
oh  i could keep you going all day.
there's some things that used to happen.
"aye  going going flat out you know they're  er heavy rains  the machines are going flat out er at the one night i i sat i sat er all night and nearly part of next day at side of one of governors, to make sure it didn't  shift  no more than about a sixteenth of an inch."
er if it had gone over  would have thrown the whole lot er gear.
they're that sensitive you know.
are they?
"oh they are, very sensitive is er is those machines."
they are.
er.
your normal work  what did you do in your leisure er leisure time?
oh i'd a little workshop and used to make stuff.
what sort of things?
oh er i'd made one or two little machines and and machine tools and stuff like that.
there's one on on on the board er in the er engine room at at dolgarrog in the machine room that i made.
and i i last time i were there i went there for erm  well  to put it  fairly straight  i went to consult  on something that'd been done.
ooh it was all  that that  do in these  commutators that .
"and i made them jigs and whatnot.   when they come to do it at dolgarrog  when they come to want them doing i said to the  to the  the chief engineer i said, he told me about they were going  get these commutators done here  machine."
they're massive machines you know.
"oh he says  oh i says, well what do you do ?"
oh  stones  made by martindales.
now that's er that's er er a carborundum stone  and it goes  it fits on a jig at side of machine.
now there's the machine is there  the laminated copper  er these commutators and it's on main shaft  that goes right through the generator and the turbine.
and they've got to be kept true.
now you'll never get a true surface with a commutator stone.
with a com stone.
because it er er the machine was grinding the stone away the stone wasn't grinding the the the copper.
i stuck to that theory all the way through.
oh yes it does.
"oh no it doesn't, i says  but you do your er have it your own way."
but it made awful mess.
and i told them about this job i'd done here.
oh he pooh-poohed it.
"i says, well  alright that er  very very nice chap to deal with and oh i i got on alright with him but he wouldn't have this."
"so  oh after i retired  some years, we have a dinner every year you see it'll be it'll be coming off in december."
and it's er er we go to ffestiniog power station to have a drink and then come to er  er well we've been at royal hotel at betsy-coed these last years or two.
"but anyway that  i said to mr , he's the head over all the hydroelectric stations  over this erm i said mr  these commutators  i told him  doing the ."
"oh, he says, i never heard of anything like that."
"he says, next time we have them to do at dolgarrog we'll  send for you."
"and the maintenance engineer at ffestiniog, mr , i know him very well, he came here  er like you did downstairs, come to see me one evening."
oh aye he says er  you come dolgarrog tomorrow?
"i said, bit short notice isn't it?"
well he says   want you to come and see this  idea that we er how we do these commutators.
i says what do you them with?
oh he says we  a jig and er  a diamond tool.
that's that's no good.
"i says, that isn't same as what i said."
we turn it er turn them  i said with a er cutting tool.
"well, he says  he says, we're we're doing it with a with a  with a er a diamond tool."
i  i went  to dolgarrog   came for me with a car  and mr  couldn't be there.
but he asked me if i'd send them er er a full report of it after day after they'd done it.
i wasn't doing it.
i went to see er how they were doing it you see.
oh .
er  says er it would  that diamond tool were only sending dust  copper dust.
it should have been a a  a erm a  copper coming off with turning tool.
and i asked the man in the engineering .
"i said, what speed are you going on?"
"oh, he says, a hundred."

to what er they show some of the old films like they had in them days  some of these circus pictures  and travel pictures  now i'll tell you something  that's rather remarkable  i'll i'll tell you as briefly as i can.
when i one time when i was wounded in france  i was on the somme you know.
were you ?
and ypres  and them places.
"paschendale was later, one of my cousins was killed at paschendale."
"but one time er i'd been er i were wounded and i 'd come er they bring you to clearly stations, thousands   got into one  i  in this  ward er  tents and best way they could you know  and nurses there and all."
so near the line   they're the only ones that went near front line.
"but anyway i remember one time and it er i think it was christmas time, and there was a german  they brought germans in just same as us you know  fritz."
"and he were in next bed to me, the truckle beds you know."
er the next bed to me  and he he were trying to talk to me and i er he   and he wanted one of my buttons of my tunic.
gun buttons.
the royal artillery had a regimental  button.
so i  give him one  here you are er i says you can have it.
i says what you gonna give me?
"ooh he says  his pocket, he he got a german field postcard out."
you know we had we had field postcards in all them days.
"and this were a er field his regiment with his regiment on, and he wrote his name on  and where he came from."
in hanover.
he wrote this on .
and i had that in my pocket for years.
and then  when my wife died and i had to sell all you know it er i think er it got away with er some old stuff you know.
you lost it?
i think that's where lost lost it.
but there a sequel to it.
"long after i came to the army as i were telling you i used to go to pictures, i were in the in the savoy down mostyn street one one night i went  and there in the programme there was this old  er travel picture er some town or other ."
and that that night the travel picture came on and it said  hanover.
and it all come to me then.
i remembered that german lad at er sat at side and i gave of one my gun buttons and he gave me this postcard.
", hanover."
and a beautiful  town you know.
showed all all about it.
remarkable that i.
it was.
you never got  round to going over to visit him then?
"no i er i said er if i'd have kept that postcard it there were his address on you see i could have i could have found him, but  no."
but you know when i when i last time i came from france and i came came across the  widest part of the channel  er i got done once  i had a b written on my board and then they come and  crossed it out.
and i  back up the line i had to go.
but some months after when i was er i were badly hurt that last time.
i got it round here you know.
in your head?
"aye er and er  i got to the  now   on the  and  steamers  go so far up, past le havre at the mouth  le havre we disembarked when we went out to france first time and we took guns and all sorts."
. but coming that time i was dumped in a  in a field.
"thousands wounded you know, you couldn't get you into these into er huts, they were army huts you know er and taking them in er out in rain and er best best you could."
but eventually i got in.
oh i could tell you a lot about this but i'll i'll just tell you a little bit that's all.
er we came  i was er  the doctor put a big b on my board at back.
blighty.
oh i'm alright for  i'm going this time.
and they didn't cross it off.
there were one night  the door  and we'd been in quarantine you know for that three weeks.
but that's where there's a lot more stories attached to that.
he said  he shouted my name out.
be ready for england at two o'clock.

and it were er early evening then.
and i were ready.
got my uniform on and everything.
"i could  walker, i were a walker."
i could walk you know.
i wasn't i were only bandaged up.
and we crossed from  to southampton.
that's the widest part of the channel.
and night before they'd sunk a hospital ship.
u-boats.
we came across in broad daylight.
we got to southampton alright.
and i'd written the postcard on boat er they gave us all postcards to send home.
but i  er i never wrote it till we got to other side.
"and i wrote it because we  there was a new great western i remember this quite , new great western hospital train on,double engine  on platform at southampton."
wonderful train.
six   six  of beds.
and the corridor down and two or three kitchens that were  we we went er i asked one of the attendants  i got a i grabbed the  another chap with me we  we'd come across together.
"he said, let's get in here and we got in, he got into one bunk at one side and i got in to other."
right level with the window.
you know you could see out onto platform.
and we went from there from southampton to aberdeen.
"that's a long way, fifteen hours on the train."
"and it only stopped once and that were at er unless it stopped to change engines somewhere, perhaps it would, but it stopped in birmingham for twenty minutes and what a twenty minutes it were."
they let the people in you know  ooh my  by time we set off i er it were like christmas.
"my bunk and  all the others were piled up with stuff, cigarettes, chocolates, money, magazines  anything you could wish for."

"say about, about half a day a week."
that's all you went for.
did other schools use.
cos all the other schools they filled in the rest part of the week.
so you were all different schools?
"all the different schools had cos then we had, used to compete against all sports and we used to get an afternoon football we used to march from  the  and erm play football but we didn't go up there until at half-time at erm play-time so they went to school at two o'clock and at half past three then that'd be our break, then we'd go erm football till five o'clock."
was five o'clock your usual finishing time?
usual finishing time at school five o'clock.
what time did you start in the morning?
at eight o'clock.
"we start our school at eight o'clock, at nine o'clock it used to be prayers in the hall."
they were long days?
they were long days at school.
how old were you then?
"how old was i then, nine or ten."
and then from that school you went another one?
"i went to hemel hempstead  er a school called  in hemel hempstead that was only from the august till december when i left school and then the erm then the headmistress, cos we had a headmistress there cos it was a mixed school, and she recommended me for this here errand boy's job, his name was ."
you took the job?
pardon?
you took the job did you.
"i took the job yes, ten shillings a week."
where was this?
that was in hemel hempstead.
did you like it?
"no i didn't cos i was on, i used to be on a oil card delivering paraffin oil round the countryside and then cos i used to stink apparently and then i got this job at er  on a pushbike."
"unclear lot cleaner, i got ten shillings from them and a shilling from the next door for cleaning their windowsill every morning."
that's a small little homemade bakers then on on the easter.
thank you.
my father come to see me at  one holiday and the easter time he see something happen and they didn't like him and cos all my  as cabin boy.
so you came straight back to ipswich?
come straight back to ipswich.
and you then started work?
i started work on the dredger.
"mm mm what did your, what did your father do when you were a child?"
pardon?
what was your father's occupation?
"oh he was on the river he was always connected with the river my father and in the first world war they towed the dredger from here to ramsgate and er he was, he was in the army but he was connected to the inland water transport and cos they were dredging out the harbour at ramsgate."
"i have known him to come home  he's had a weekend off with a kitbag full of fish, beautiful fish he used to bring home cos  no sooner on the train and right home."
mm mm.
"and they all come home lovely and fresh, plaice and different types of fish."
and that all used to end up on your dinner plate?
that did yes.
was your father a dredgerman then?
"he was a dredgerman yes, see he was on the river first then he went on the dredger and course that's before my time and that was during the first world war he was he was at ramsgate."
"course then he finished, they finished dredging at night on, at nineteen thirty two cos they said it was costing too much the  did and erm they were building some new cranes down there, so i said to my father, and he was very friendly with the harbourmaster, he said erm was there any chance of getting one of them cranes so when he went and saw the harbourmaster he said no he said the boy don't know nothing about electricity either so he said no nor did no other buggers he said they didn't know anything about it so he got the job."
he didn't want to know anything he wanted to drive the crane so he give me a start.
"so when you started at the dock, you started as what?"
i started as a cabin boy on the dredger.
what did that involve?
well  that erm keeping the galley fire  which i let out several times.
was it a coal fire?
"coal fire and er scrubbed the cabin out like that, soda water and soft soap."
when you let the fire out did you get into trouble?
yeah i just swore at my father  did well i said getting up at six o'clock in the morning every day and then go to work till six at night cos during the day i get tired so i use to lay down on his bunk  then he'd lift his little hat a way up and he'd say er  bloody fire's out.
cos he'd want a cup of tea.
so you cooked on the fire ?
"yeah cooked, we done everything on the fire."
mm mm.
"yeah old galley stove, galley oven just like the oven it was, so you had your full hearth and used to bake in the oven and you cook on the top, and you had about five different rings cos the fire is to put the damper in the chimney to make the heat go round the oven."
you used to cook all your own meals on that?
"do all our own meals yes, my mother she used to mix up, to say that we want er suet pudding and erm she had mixed up ready and put the cloth on top and all i got to do is just boil the water and just stick it in."
that was handy then.
"she used to make me a  plum duff, the old currant duffs and  anything like that my mother would make for us."
you never went hungry then?
"never went hungry, no my mother always have a good, always used to have a good table, very good, we were a very lucky family, anybody used to come in our house on a weekend they always thought there was a party every weekend."
well my father was earning a good money.
"i mean women, men in the warehouse they were on about two guineas a week."
"now my father was earning five pounds seven and six, twelve and six a week so there was a big difference in money weren't there and then you see be that list when they finished dredging he had to drop right back two pounds thirteen a week."
what else did you do just as a cabin boy ?
"what else if i, i have to go and relieve er if i want er to only work down the cabin and it come to meal times cos we carried on dredging from six in the morning we do all the winters round cos they eat on the dredger they used to eat three winches four winches on the dredger cos they'd heave the dredger across the river and back again,when they come to meal times i used to have to go on and relieve the man what was driving that winch and i used cos the er er chins coming round the barrel of the winch they used to override and i used to have a handle to knock them clear."
why did you have to knock them clear?
well if you didn't there'd be so much change on the bail that they all start to fall off and there'd be all one big muddle cos that and as chain coming down that used to come right down into the chain locker to the bottom of the ships.
what was the chain locker?
well a chain locker is where all the spare chain used to like coil up.
so it  came in and it went round.
"round the barrel about three times round the barrel then right down into the chain locker but if you kept, let it ride what we used to call let it ride well  well now it get so big then you have to run it all off cos you had one lever, that's what you had and the steam valve could have all steamed."
all the machinery was.
all steam.
operated by steam.
all even the engine room was steam cos you had the bucket  depth of dredging on that ladder was thirty six feet that's what  dredger can go down so far with the buckets going round and they used to dredge about thirty six feet.
actually go down and thirty six foot of water?
down yes.
dredge down?
could do yes.
what do you mean by the ladder?
the ladder is where the buckets er er run on you see  that's the ladder like that from what they call the top tumbler what used to be the top tumbler used to have five sides.
what do you mean by tumbler?
"well a tumbler is where they, the buckets used to go over the top and empty into a chute into the hopper  and er went cos it was on a continual chain you see cos you had a bucket two links, a bucket two links, a bucket two links, all the way round and that's how you used to dredge all the time round and round and round and that's how it went over to the top tumbler cos you had a bottom tumbler on this layer and a top tumbler, otherwise  you couldn't dredge otherwise and that top tumbler, i am certain it had five, five sides to it because at one, at one time you'd tip a bucket on one then you'd get two lengths  so it kept the tumbler more or less equal all the way round the wear and tear of it."
"and , would you lower the, the ladder into the water?"
yeah you'd lower that down.
my father used to have what they call a lead line that used to be a wire with all marked with feet and fathoms on and  sound and.
so you had to.
"and then when you dredged across  again cos you used you always went er, you always had er er say every foot he had with a piece of spunyarn in the wire."
spunyarn?
"spunyarn, yes."
what's spunyarn?
"well that's like er tarred rope  that's what it was and er used to put a piece through the wire every foot and when you come to six feet there'd be a piece of leather, cut cut  one piece of leather."
"then you had this next fathom, the second fathom had the leather  cut in two and then have different colours at every feet ."
"and this, so these were attached to what?"
just a bit of wire.
just a piece of wire?
"and he used have it in his hand in a loop and he used to top it over the side with a big lead weight on and that  and he, he'd know how much deep the er river was."
was that recognised tools.
pardon?
what that a recognised tool for judging the depth?
oh yes yes you  that yes.
"see and then in the finish they went on the wire, they went to chain."
and how did they use chains?
"well they chain just the same way, just marks on it and."
was there any benefit in changing over to chain?
"well i think there's  the stretching of it you see, i mean wire after a certain time it would stretch."
yes.
"where a chain wouldn't, that'd wear a little bit but not too much."
so as a cabin boy you had to relieve.
"i had to relieve, relieve the other deck hands for their meals and i started cleaning their cabin out ."
did they all have their own cabins?
"well they had one big long one, they did."
and you had to clean.
and i had to clean them and i had to  get a bucket of water and sluice it down with a hard broom and .
i used to go down the villages.
into the villages?
yeah.
what are the villages?
the villages are at the bottom of the ship.
cos then you come to your floor and then your sides used to go up  villages on a ship.
and was the water there to go down into the villages?
"yes, cos they usually all water underneath there and that used to be pumped out, the engine room would pump all that out and to heat any water up  the cabins there used to be a, a small pump what used to pump the fresh water into the boiler and i used to have a  a piece of er copper  off that and just turn the steam on put it into a bucket of cold water and then driving the pump that'd go into the, the er bucket and heat the water and boil it."
and that was your own invention was it?
yes.
"but the hoppers they used to be, er two hoppers we had two of them hoppers, we had the er one called the."
"hello, hello girl, yes please a dozen, yeah, er no i don't think so, no i don't think so mate, no, yeah are you on holiday this week?"
"oh well might have perhaps  will you have a spare day  no i  want to go out for a meal  no, but i been home  but at dinner time just ."
yeah alright  yeah  i mean if your car's in you can take mine do it a bit of good.
right oh see you later.
cheerio .
"that's john, me boy, he's a docker down the erm down the dock he got a weeks holiday this week, so i took me other boy and me daughter out  last week and erm we'd left her with dogs so i said we'd take them out one day perhaps when he get his holiday."
oh i see so you are going out with him later on?
yeah  he'll see what his wife say.
you say he's a docker?
he's a docker.
actually handling the cargo?
"well he drive these, they they don't handle much now."
"they erm, what they do they drive these big tugmasters now with these lorries they plant all these erm forty foot trailers with er with er erm with a container on and place them on the ship."
so they load the ships down there now.
oh like the roll on roll off.
"roll on, exactly yeah."
ferry?
"that's right, yeah."
it's easier now isn't it?
"oh it is easier cos that all they have to do is run on, drop 'em come off again."
"going back to your life as cabin boy, what other duties did you have to perform?"
on the .
"well  shipping angus, so you know when the dredgers go on er er er creeping ahead, see we used to have er what we call the head wire there used to be a wire which was all stretched out say about half a mile and what you and erm and all according what erm how much mud you were dredging for the depth of water and then my father would give the signal to say right, cos on the, on the head wire used to have a pull, we call the pulls and they were like er a jutted piece off the wheel and he'd say five pulls ahead and we'd say one two three four five right and we went ahead with it and then when we were dredging sidewards you see, used to  sidewards, you never went ahead with it, not all the time you you  went sidewards across the river, and erm once you got  ahead your side chains they  moving up cos you got so far ahead that the side chains weren't much good to you, so you had to then move your side chains so you got off the mud in an old boat and then re  further up the river."
you say pick your anchors up in an old boat?
yes.
"you see well the point was when you pick 'em up erm we had a we had a big boat, what we called hanger boat, a very heavy boat and that used to have a wooden  so therefore we used to pull it up by hand and pull it on a little barrel with a hand power that's what we used to do and once we got the anchor in board we'd pull the chain in by hand and then rerun it again right the mud and on the anchor again."
so you actually had to go a smaller boat?
"smaller boat, yes."
go up and get the anchor.
that's right.
and pull it in to the small boat?
"pull it in to the small boat, lay it on a box and then we'd pull the chain in by hand and then we'd rerun it further up the river."
why did you do that?
"well  i mean if you er, if your chain was going too far astern you might pull the dredger astern too much so gotta keep your chain up the river, that's what you got to do all the time."
so that was your job ?
"that was my, that was part of our job."
wasn't that hard work?
"that was hard work all the time, my hands  my hands used to chap on the backs, used to chap hands and that was only, i was over the wind, i  wind and, and er when i used to scrub the cabin out which was with washing soda and soft soap and when you went along cos that was you get, you get erm, ordinary washing soda on the back of your hands and they didn't supply  anything then."
"the docker  docker mission wouldn't supply you with water boots  we had to supply our own, now today they supply them with everything even underlinen i think nearly now."
what was the wages like ?
our wages?
as a cabin boy?
well i got thirty five shillings a week and i was doing six twelve hours a day from monday till friday and twelve and a half on a saturday.
and how old were you?
fourteen years old.
was that good money for a fourteen year old?
that was good wages then.
apprentice apprentice boys in in the foundry were only getting five shillings a week.
"apprentice boy, my mate he er our friend  dead and gone, he's a good turner that runs er er reels, yet erm that's all he got was five shillings a week after er no seven year's apprenticeship."
so you were on really good money?
"so i, i was earning good money."
do you think that's why they asked you to buy your own protective clothing or was that normal  ?
"unclear get to buy your own i, i er didn't have rubber boots, i had big leather boots me thigh, that's what i bought and that leather then they didn't have nails in the shoes in the, in the bottom they had wooden pegs, the, your leather was held by wooden pegs and the  and the leather at that time were the thigh boots, you could roll them right the way down,."
were they specially made?
"specially made, yes."
did you have them made in ipswich?
"no, we bought them all secondhand well they used to come round with this, not secondhand stuff but all new stuff and he used to go round the dock selling different er water boot socks and sweaters and he  dealer."
how did he get round the docks?
"oh he used to have his pushbike, go round."
what bicycle with a box on?
"yes, never had a motor car then, nobody had a motor car then only the harbourmaster and he had a little old austin ruby, the harbourmaster did, but other  duty harbourmaster he had a motorbike and sidecar."
he used to go to work on pushbike.
he lived in  at that time just over the road er down the road here  and then something went wrong during the war  that was over my father and er cos when my father come off the dredger erm the harbourmaster wanted to give him er he give him the push and  turned round and he said  my father name was .
?
", that was his nickname and er he went into the office and he told the harbourmaster he said if you don't employ  back again he said i'm off and  out and he took me father back again."
he got his job back?
"he got his job back, you see, and erm."
do you know why he was called ?
"no i don't, no that was just a nickname they give him for years ago, i  the other day, i was walking up   and he called me , so i took me father's name you see, nickname, that was ."
"extraordinary, isn't it ?"
and me other me other uncle he was called .
so the nickname followed on really?
"that followed on right through the family but my boys they haven't got that name, cos they older they, old  all gone now, old doctors and that."
going back to the man with the pushbike.
did he come round every week?
"oh yes, that was his living unclear."
"so he, he was er."
"anybody want anything he was there, his name was  and he used to run up like er tally, tallyman he was you'd pay at the most ten shillings down about two and six a week, something like that."
what credit?
"yes, so that's, he was round after his money every week."
oh i see and  got what sort of things did he sell?
"i mean, he sell anything in the clothes line, anything."
i know these boots we bought off him they were three pound twelve and six they were.
"i mean they were lovely boots  i mean a pair of water boots three pounds twelve and six and we used to put them, er make 'em soft, we used to do them over with text oil."
"that was like er er what you call a linseed oil, they call is text that's some animal's erm oil i think the house and cos they used to, used to rub that in  and you could  them down lovely."
also made them waterproof ?
"waterproof , yes."
with the oil in them unclear.
yes.
did you have to wear any other sort of special clothing?
"we, when we were dredging, we were dredging now from cliff quay and er used to get all this er grey mud and erm and the chalk and when we used to dredge, we got down to chalk er, more or less the depth we wanted to go and anybody dredging down there today if they dredge the chalk at cliff quay that's the depth of water you want and erm then we dredged erm just below erm  and then we went to freston  freston we were dredging peat."
pondoes well you got pondoes one side and you got freston on the other and we were dredging up .
"in that peat there used to be deer's teeth, everything, parts of the jaw, horns, what we were dredging up, then we went further down to erm downham reach, that's just before the cattoes and we were dredging all green clay."
green clay?
green clay we were dredging and sometimes you know that wouldn't leave the bucket.
"the clay wouldn't you couldn't clear the buckets, so we used to  what we had a grafting tool, that was like a spade but that was, er, that was er, narrow at one end, the spade at the bottom end was narrow so you could cut cut the  clay , out the buckets and that was a hard job too."
that was difficult?
yes.
was it your job to do that?
"well that was, that was the crew's job you see cos you used to have, they used to be erm, they used to be the master of the ship, my father, and they would still have a mate , he's dead and gone  and there was myself one side on the starboard side on a winch and we had two men right on the after winch and they used to have to look after three chains."
cos you had a stern chain and two side chains.
because you had to have the stern anchor to keep the buckets off the face of what you was dredging cos if you didn't your dredge'd go ahead too much and er you had big problems there and you wouldn't be able to dredge.
did your dredger have a name?
just the.
"that was just the , yeah, dredger  and the tug was called er nine 0, the ninety."
"then after that they bought another tug called , then they had another one called the , that was a diesel tug."
what were the other tugs?
er steam.
steam?
and they  sorry.
"cos the the reason they, they er done away with the steam tugs and had a diesel, because a diesel you could start up and er when the dredging finished they tipped the tug at ipswich and er if they want they  one of the big ships up the river, cos then they could start the diesel up quite, right away, whereby a steam tug you  a fire there all the time."
"i mean a steam tug you got to have coal and you got to have the old boiler, old boiler, you got to heat that up for the steam cos that didn't pay then."
"that was a, that was a  tug."
did the steam always work with the dredger?
yes.
what was that to move her about?
"well no, that's to, we had two what they call, two dumb hoppers the roxanne and the sandbank and those dumb hoppers had to be towed to sea and take."
what do what do you mean by dumb hopper?
"dumb hoppers well they ain't got any part, everything was hand."
and why did you have them?
"well that's a, that's a thing of that particular day, at that time and life erm and then they get  what they call, they bought a steam hopper, so the steam hopper would say, could get to sea quicker in half the time the dumb hoppers could and so we were rotating all the time, there used to be one dumb hopper go to sea, one steam hopper and we'd be loading the other dumb hopper and then course the steam hopper would be back in half the time we'd  that and that's how we rotate, day to day."
by the hopper you mean carrying the soil?
"carrying, carrying all the soil to sea."
oh erm it was dumped at sea was it?
"yeah it was dumped at sea off the cork, cork light  erm cork lightship."
"they used to have an imaginary light er an imaginary mark from cork lightship to walton on the naze and er the men who bought the cork lightship, they would take notice every time that hopper went out there, they'd see when they were dumping cos if that was, if they were cute, some of the boys, they'd dump short of the dumping ground, that's what used to happen, cos they'd report them then to harwich, harwich will report them to harbourmaster at ipswich, then there'd be a."
and who would get into trouble for that?
"well the skipper of the hopper, he get into trouble for that cos he should have gone out to the dumping ground."
and did that often happen?
"oh no that didn't, and  cos they got a good job, i mean five pound seven and six a week a skipper's earnings."
"the mate used to get erm on the dredger the tug and the two dumb hoppers, or the  dumb hoppers they used to get four pound five shillings a week  and erm and my father got five pound twelve and six and then it went so long we were given near the end of the dredger and er in the harbourmaster's wisdom he cut us all down five shillings a week, so we get three pound fifteen shillings."
why did he cut you down?
well cos  they were getting short of money.
when was this then?
this be about nineteen twenty nine.
why were they getting short of money?
"well cos the government had allowed them so much i suppose and erm that was costing them so much on wages and that, so they had to cut them down on wages."
so this was a particular project just to  river?
"that's right and er at that year, that er time, we had a drop of five shillings a week and he had an increase of fifty pound a year."
harbourmaster did.
how did that go down ?
not very good.
that's what he got that was  little irishman.
were there any problems that?
"no we couldn't say nothing because i mean that was a time when you had a good job then, unemployment was just the same in the nineteen thirties."
"i mean nineteen thirty, thirty one was a bad time for  employment."
so this job was coming to an end about this time?
"that was yeah, that finished in nineteen thirty two."
you were all concerned i suppose?
"we were, yes, cos that's when i went the crane driving  in for a crane and got it you see, that's why i finished up as a crane driver until i went stevedoring."
"so going back to the dredging, did you eventually take over from your father on the dredger?"
"no, no, my father he finished his dredging  harbourmaster, and that's when they finished dredging then."
what else did you have to do on the dredger?
"well anything what was going, anything, change the buckets, on the   that used to be every saturday afternoons, they used to be home ."
"we used to work there from half past twelve till five o'clock at night, taking the bucket out and put another bucket in because the buckets what they used to call the bushes what were connected to the links they used to wear and we used to have to take them, one of them out and used to have a big chain go right the way round and bring the, bring the buckets backwards and they used to loosen up all the, all the pins what used to go through the buckets in the, in the links, so we took them out  and then they used to go the dock and they put new bushes in."
used to bring them the dock.
used to bring them the dock.
and put them in a boat and bring them back?
put them up in a boat yeah.
"they used to, cos they'd put a couple in the old anchor boat what we  weren't using it, put a couple in there and they'd tow 'em the dock."
"how would you get them into the boat, because they must have been heavy?"
"well we had old wooden crane aboard the dredger,that was all hand power, that's just the old wooden derrick and when they got the, the dock, they had a, cos they had a  crane paint with it or a steam crane."
and they used to come the maintenance workshop.
"maintenance workshop and be done, that used to be the job for the fitters and blacksmiths."
did you have to wait for it to be done?
"no, no, cos we always had so many spare buckets you see."
oh you carried spares .
how large were the buckets?
i would say they be about erm three feet across.
"that's, that's  i'd say three feet across."
and how deep?
"oh about erm three feet deep i reckon they were, i mean to load up er eight hundred tonnes, which we average these hoppers out at, er er we were getting a good soil we'd load up eight hundred tonne in an hour and a half to two hours, between hour and a half to two hours we'd be loaded, that's all depend on what you was dredging, you might be interested in  and, and go quicker, if you were dredging greenfly that's be alright you'd, if you dredged peat well that hopper would be full but it wouldn't be half it'd be half loaded you see, be down to the plimsoll mark."
"so, so much lighter?"
that's lighter stuff.
"if you er dredged ballast, did you used to dump the ballast?"
"yes that used to  but sometimes they used to bring it up the river and they use a lot  the ballast we er did dredge for erm, for the first part of cliff quay, used it when they built that."
you remember cliff quay being developed?
i remember it yes.
"well before i went to hemel hempstead, my father was dredging the first part of the quay at six hundred feet, what we call a six hundred feet, the first part and er i used to take his dinner down, because he'd, he wouldn't have anything cooked aboard the ship."
why was that?
"i don't know but he wouldn't, he wouldn't have it cooked aboard there, my mother used to cook it for him and i'd stagger down in an ordinary shopping basket, in two basins there'd be vegetables in one and his pudding and gravy in the other and i used to take that down for him and he used to come ashore and he used to then go and have it."
"that that weren't far from  to er cliff quay, do it in about ten minutes on your bike."
how did you get out to the boat?
"well they used to have a little rowing boat and come after it, he used to get one of the lads  while they come ashore and got his dinner."
did they take you back or just the dinner?
"no, they just they just take the, the dinner back."
did you used to want to go over?
"oh i, i'd gone over several times, oh yes."
excuse me.
"i got swore at many a time, i did."
"well i tell you what i was doing, i was in the stern of the boat coming ashore with one oar in the stern of the boat, i was  like hell you know, and i was standing on the  sculling."
on the.
"on the seats we'll call it, on the seats of the rowing boat, i was standing on that and my father said to me when i got aboard, don't do that no more, he said, cos he say if that paddle, what we call the paddle, come that sculling hole, he said you'll go over the side and the boat will go you, he said, you'll be bloody well drowned, which was right  never forgot it never."
"now it was the truth, i mean when you scull the boat, they call that sculling, rowing, they usually do a figure of eight with one oar and a figure of eight, that's how you do that, that's a hard job to keep that into that here hole at the back of the boat, because."
where was the hole then.
"the hole on the stern of the boat, see you got your boat come round like that,."
"from, from a point erm."
from the point down to the stern of the boat and then there was a hole in there like that cut the wood.
just like your u shaped .
"that's right and put your paddle in that and you scull  you had to come down every time and many a time people'd learn that that paddle will come out, but once you got the knack of it you could do it one hand, cos you was cutting down all the time like  that's what it was."
"so you were, in fact, going backwards, backwards  the boat was going forward."
"that's right, yeah, that's right  you was back to where you were going."
did you ever have any accidents?
"no, no, i  scull one hand, like that."
but you used to get in trouble for standing on the seats?
"for standing on the, on the seats you see, which i mean my father was right he'd got the experience to know that several men had been drowned like that."
what else did you get in trouble for?
"oh nothing else, no nothing else, well we daren't because i mean my father was so strict, you know you gotta do as your told."
"on the dredger what other jobs would you have to do in the way of maintenance, you said you had to repair the buckets."
"buckets, well every night time, when we finished dredging, you had to wash down, wash the decks down cos i mean that the decks used to be covered in mud and slush, so all we had then was an old draw bucket on a bit of rope, over the side, there weren't no hoses then, we used to  the bucket and then we used to swing all the mud back in there, in the river."
just wash the decks down.
"so you used to put the, drop the bucket down the side."
"yes, on a bit.. on a bit of rope."
then haul it back up.
"haul it back up, then chuck it down on the deck."
and scrub your decks after.
scrub the decks  clean.
"where was the mud coming from, falling out the bucket?"
"fall out the bucket you see on the  when they  over the top tumbler that'd splash on into the chute, there used to be a chute, take it right into the harbour."
"when that gone down they used to splash cos that used to come underneath the buckets and our cabin hatchway was facing that and many a time that'd come right down the cabin, the mud."
actually fall down inside the ?
that would i mean that'd splash down there.
so it was quite messy ?
"oh that was messy, you're telling me  was messy, i've known cups of tea, you put a cup of tea on there the other cup of tea was there, well we never used to have saucers couldn't afford them, that'd be there a mug of tea and that'd move like that off the table that'd come cos the dredger was shaking so much."
actually vibrate the whole boat?
that vibrate the whole boat that would do.
was it noisy?
"noisy, helluva row."
and you liked working on there?
"oh  i really enjoyed it, yes."
really enjoyed working there.
became a way of life for you.
pardon?
i would have thought it became a way of life?
"well i think it was  i mean that erm when you dredge from the causeway i'd say near the harbourmaster's office and we dredged all the way to botterman's bay just below pinmill and that botterman's bay was  that's a place where they had  and that's where the big ships used to moor then and they used to get.. be lightened, like all grain goods and that used to be loaded into barges by hand and then when it goes so light they used to  the fish with about three thousand grain in 'em and then they used to fill them up in the dock, on the same method."
how long did it take you to dredge that length?
well we dredged them from nineteen twenty five to nineteen thirty two.
and you were dredging all the while?
"all the time yes, say about six weeks, used to come in in the winter  to repair the  do maintenance on the dredger and then the old harbourmaster would say right, we should have been here for six weeks, he come after a month, he'd say, paint the  cover the rust up he said and bugger off out again."
"start dredging, see he wanted to get the job done."
"i know that on sunday i was on, on the  watch, this weekend, and there was so much ice on the river, our anchor boat which is all made of wood, that's moored up alongside the dredger and when i went along and got, that was about twelve o'clock in the mid-day."
"that was half full of water and the ice had cut through the wood  flow down the river, cos the water was coming in like hell and er cos one thing i had to do about it, had like a chain in the, in in the boat, so we pulled the chain out, i pulled the chain out first and just got the, the erm hull just above water so i  bail the boat out with a bucket chuck it down the side right quick."
that's how i saved the boat then.
"otherwise it'd er fill right up down to the side the, the top of the boat, that was on a sunday."
were you working this particular sunday?
"well i was on watch, weekend watch, you see."
what was weekend watch?
"well  i went to work on the saturday morning at six and we were dredging until half past twelve, then we would, then do repairs till five o'clock at night and then five o'clock at night, when the other crew had gone home, when i start to stay there then from five o'clock saturday night till monday morning six o'clock all the time just to keep watch on the dredger, i used to sleep mind you during part of the time and erm used to have a big old tortoise stove down the cabin and make good fire."
when you say tortoise stove.
"well that was what they call it, tortoise stove, used to be a big stove and that ain't got no grate in they had er they used to feed it from the top,."
what with?
"coal, and then rake down to the bottom and that's when you open the little door for the draught to go up and they they call them tortoise stove."
is that what kept you warm?
that what kept us warm.
"i didn't sleep in my father's bunk i used to sleep on the table, i er had an old flock mattress, that's what i had, an old flock mattress and a flock pillow."
why did you sleep on the table?
well the  was right near the fire.
see we had a fire right in the middle of the cabin and i used to chuck this here er flock mattress on the table and the blankets over the old flock pillow and go to sleep that way.
what were you keeping watch for while you were ?
"well we had to keep somebody on watch there was any damage, say the ship was  up the river and a chain broke or they hit you, so you had to put your navigation lights up and to put navigation lights up we had hurricane lamps, we had a red and a white one, they should have been six foot apart, they never were they was about three foot."
why was that?
"well, that's the quickest way to do it, we used to hang one below the other on the dredger,be put up at sunset and we used to take 'em down early in the morning, but you always had, you always had erm navigation lights up, must."
so this was part of the job at the weekend?
"that was part of your job as a watchman, you have to  all the little paraffin lamps, that's all they were, sometimes they'd keep alight and sometimes they wouldn't, they'd go out but there was  there was never much erm work at night times on the river, might be an old barge."
"i remember one time er these barges, old barges when you used to come up there, they ain't got any engine in 'em because now they got motors in 'em, but erm, at that time, i was asleep one night and er these barges had been up, they'd been down the  the engine room, cos the engine room and the stoke hall was all in one and and then i was so sound asleep they'd filled the sacks up with coal and took them up over the  and took  the only thing they did do they didn't take the shovel they'd used, cos they bought their shovel from off the barge and they left that downhill that's how they'd pinched the coal."
it didn't make any difference to me.
they actually came aboard and pinched your coal?
"they'd pinched the coal and that didn't make any difference to me because it weren't my coal,."
did you have any coal left after that?
"oh yeah, we had plenty of coal, plenty of coal."
i didn't mind them taking any coal.
and you were asleep while they did it?
but i was asleep while the  while they took it.
but then you gained their shovel anyway.
gained their shovel.
"cos their shovel was different to ours, but that weren't any good to us cos that was er, cos what they used to  trim grain with, now a grain shovel was made of tin and cos our shovels what they used to feed the boiler with were all steel shovels."
so that wasn't strong enough to shovel coal?
"they weren't any good to shovel coals no,is to give it away again."
"did did that usually happen, come aboard and steel ?"
"oh very often, yeah, very often."
"now we used to clean the bottom up cos  used to be a big boiler in the dredger and erm we used to close down every six weeks, which they used to call blow the boiler down, that mean that they open the valve and the heat used to take all the water into the river, so er, that used to be blown down friday night, come saturday morning we'd start at six o'clock and chip all the fur off inside the boiler, cos the boiler was made with all  and what we call the crown, that used to be the two furnaces, cos they're double the big boiler were a double furnace and we had to chip all that fur off them, well it used to take us now from six o'clock in the morning or say seven when we got there  had to go down the tug and er go down the tug and erm, then we go aboard and strip off."
"you didn't want any clothes on, you put a pair of trousers on, that's all you want and old thin shirt and chip all this stuff off the  what we call the crown."
was it hot in there?
"that was hot, yes and there used to be  that's where your furnace used to go in and come back and up out the chimney and that they put them the  in there to heat the water quick you see and yet they ought to be, they had to be sliced out with a what they call a slice, cos they used to get furred up and we used to give them nineteen and sixpence for that  to fill the boiler up again, we had used to have take  pinmill and they used to have to  come up  to get fresh water into the anchor boat and we used to pump it up by hand, into the boiler."
everything was done by hand?
everything was done by hand.
everything.
"when you got water, when you came the docks to get water, where would you obtain that from?"
well they usually out  the er hydrant on the quay cos the hydrant on the quay there used to be a water main the water main used to go along there and we used to put so much water into the boat and now we come down and used to pump that out and then go back after some more.
was that a hydrant available for the use of all the steam boats?
"yes that was, oh yes."
were there many hydrants?
"oh yes, on, on cliff quay."
"you get  i reckon you get one about every fifty yards, something like that."
maybe less than that.
you've still got 'em round the dock now.
where are they now?
on the edge of the quay.
do they still work?
"they still work  i  they've got  there used to be one man er employed to erm give these er boats water, fresh water drinking water."
what would ?
"what would he be called, what was, what."
he just call him the waterman.
waterman?
"the waterman, and he had, he had a clock his hydrant, to say how much water the  the  the boat taken."
soon did  they soon take up enough he used to go with his book and get it signed by the mate or the er captain of the ship.
and is  do you know how much they were charged?
"i don't know but an ordinary barge used to have a little wooden crate and he want to have a little tank, they put a fixed charge on of two and six pence that's what they done."
he had a small pond ?
"if he had a small pond it used to be  was two and sixpence that's all they used to charge, but the other boats, now the boats that used to come from rotterdam they wouldn't fill up there and they were dutch boats, they wouldn't fill up in water the rhine in rotterdam, they always wait until they come to ipswich and got fresh water."
why was that?
"well it was better than what theirs was, cos theirs come the rhine."
which wasn't very clean?
"weren't very clean and er course ipswich water's all nice fresh water, they always filled up with fresh water at ipswich, the dutch boats which was the  we had three boats there, they used to be the ipswich , ipswich progress and ipswich pioneer."
"they had them three boats and then they used to take  do away with the small boats and they had one big one, the ipswich erm pioneer progress something like that."
what did they do?
they used to bring all general cargo from rotterdam to ipswich.
when was this?
"oh about erm, let me see about ten years ago."
oh you're going back ten years ?
"yeah, about ten years that's all."
"going back to when you were on watch on the dredger over the weekends, did it ever feel lonely?"
"well we had er,there always used to be one man aboard the dumb hopper,they used to leave there for monday morning and they used to him, a man with him."
"with me there, but he'd be aboard the dumb hopper and i'd be aboard the dredger and i remember one man, he turned round, his name was  ex naval man he was and er i went round on the sunday morning and he didn't speak to me on the saturday."
"i went to him on the sunday morning i said morning charlie, he said morning and i said i said goodnight charlie, he say goodnight and that's the only thing he said to me all the weekend."
that's true.
yeah.
"he used he used he used to take about half a dozen bottles of beer on the saturday morning with him and that's where he used to be in his, in his galley and he wouldn't move out that galley all the time."
he wasn't a talkative  .
"oh he weren't, no."
"coo charlie  i always remember him, ex naval man."
so how did you fill in your time?
eh?
how did you fill in your time?
"just sit there and do anything, do a bit of fishing."
fishing?
"yeah, you could fish in the river then."
what sort of fish did you used to get?
"small little dabs, dabs and eels."
did you eat them.
yes.
you used to cook them ?
cook them .
"i know, i went, i got some whelks once and that was in  bay, they were lovely whelks and i put 'em in a bucket and er didn't think and now i used to put some flour in with 'em."
"if you put flour with 'em, with the whelk they used to make 'em nice and fat and tender."
"why, because they feed on it?"
"they're feeding on this here, on this flour."
"anyhow, the next morning i got up they were all over the deck, they crawled the bloody bucket."
they crawled out the bucket all over the deck.
that  my first experience of catching whelks.
how did you catch the whelks?
"well you had used to have a hoop net,and that used to be a like with a hoop."
"that used to be with er a piece of net in and across the top used to have two piece of wire, one way, and two piece the other and you catch a crab open the crab open and they used to put the crab between there and the whelks used to feed on the crab and then when you pulled it out, they all went to the bottom of the net."
clever.
that's how we used to catch the fish like that.
earlier on you were talking about erm the dredger bringing up fish or your father.
"oh yes we cos when you're dredging, you see when the eels came in the mud, eels always go in the mud in the winter time, you don't, many eels swirl out, they go in the mud and when you're dredging and they're going into the hopper, cos they used to get stunned and they used to swim round right down the top of the water and they used to come the side, and if they come the side you could have your  knife and just come here, cos they were stunned, pick 'em out."
what you lean over?
"no, well there weren't much to see if your hopper was full, you ain't got far to go cos they only come about a foot off side, you see you could just kneel down there and catch 'em."
did everybody take fish?
well there were them what could get 'em.
they won't be interest to someone.
something go a hang whether they had cut the fish or not.
where was the best place for bringing up fish on the river?
"i reckon the best place is finn mill, cos that was cleaner, see your river, now cos that's polluted now and er all you get in the river now is you get  flounders or eels, that's what you get."
"at that time, i mean, i have known when my, when i was a dredger and they used we used to clean the bottom, i have known er mussels on the bottom, used to feed on, be on the side of the ship, good mussels, but there used to be cockles, winkles."
mm.
"winkles down at finn mill there used to be well thousands, millions of them, winkles and the ships used to come round from the blackwater from colchester area, come round, stay round the finn mill about a fortnight and they used to have what they call a well in their boat and they used to have  fill up little sacks like a sand bag of winkles and take them round there and cultivate them."
now there's no  there's no er winkles in the river today.
there are fertilisers gone down the river and they kill them all off.
where do the fertilisers come from?
fertiliser factory down here.
what on the dock?
"yeah, cliff quay."
when was that built?
oh  was built oh that was built nineteen thirty odd.
mm mm.
and course they used to dump further down the  there.
"not in my time but they used to be all branched off, there used to be a lot of oysters."
now they're all gone round the colchester area.
"cos they're finished, they call them the oyster beds."
"when you were on the watch for the weekend, did you used to get extra payment for that?"
"ten shillings from saturday morning, from when they  when the men left off at half past four on a saturday till six o'clock monday morning, we got ten shillings and if  and if we were on watch on on the night time, cos we used to do one watch one week and one night one week and two nights next, cos there used to be the mate and erm three more sailors, used to take turns, well there was only four nights so the man who done the monday night, they done the friday night."
"so he got two nights in one week and the others done the monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday."
that's how they used to work around all the time.
so it was watched all the while like that?
you got to have a watchman all the time on the dredger.
did anything ever go wrong when you were on watch?
"no, never."
no.
the  the boats coming up would have passed if  if you were down the river.
any boat coming up would have come fairly close wouldn't it?
"that would do, but they should ease down when they come past, but they didn't, they never took no notice."
didn't they?
"oh no, my father stand aboard there when we have been dredging, you know, and they come up there at speed and he stood there and he swore at  at that part of if, call them all the crazy buggers  my father."
but they never took any notice?
"yes, there was one pilot down there, his name was george  and er, my father was in  one sunday and he said to my father, he said  he say you only think you know the river."
"cos he'd report there was there weren't enough water inside the place, so he said to my father, say to him, he'd say er don't you tell me  all thick he'd say, i dredge the bloody river, he say."
you keep in the channel he say you  the ground and that was the truth too.
he  he went out the channel went on the boat.
how wide was the channel?
well it was all different widths.
"the widest part, i think, is what they call near the  just below the, that's er what they call  that's not in the book now."
hall point they dunno where that.
is that hall point?
hall point that was called.
h a double l?
"and then you had one at pinmill, now they've got erm the  in there  in that book now, well that was called  point, one or two of the old names are there like deer park lodge and the river in foxes bottom."
where was foxes bottom?
"foxes bottom was just below pinmill, opposite  bay."
going ipswich?
"on going ipswich on, yes, on the pinmill side."
"cos you got nagden the other side, right opposite nagden chorlis."
"the cat house, where was that?"
"the cat house well that's at , the cat house, that's that's where the house used to be, where in er  time erm, that's where they used to put a cat in the window for the smokers."
what a real cat?
"i dunno whether it was a real cat, i don't think so, as a matter of fact i was just finished reading  the book which is interesting, tell you all about the river."
why did they put the cat in the window?
"well  smokers  all clear or not i don't know but that even mentioned in that book downham reach and that talk about the priory farm where  was cos that was all walking about  all these smugglers at that time  but the book i, the history i thought about  don't seem the same in the book now."
so you used to dredge all that length right the way down.
"all that length, yeah."
right up from in the dock.
right to the dock yes.
right the way through?
"yeah, what we call a new cut, we dredge right opposite the harbourmaster's office and we dredged all and we used to do that tide time, had to work at tides, when it's high tide, cos that  otherwise there weren't any water there ."
"that's when the erm, the pleasure boats used to run from there, the suffolk and the norfolk, them, they were erm, they were sharp both ends, the suffolk and the norfolk."
sharp both ends?
"yeah, well they got  they were, they were sharp both ends, they weren't, ain't got no stern, them paddle  they were paddle boats, so there you got one  they had a rudder each end so they had to keep one rudder shut and the other one used to steer ."
"that was the old railway boats, suffolk and the norfolk."
where did they go from?
"they went from er the new cut, near the harbourmaster's office, the stations are still there, a lot of  on there now."
"then you had the city of rochester, that was another boat, after the war, that used to run from ."
"there used to be three, the essex, the suffolk and the norfolk and the suffolk had two funnels and the er the norfolk had one funnel."
where did they go to?
"and they used to run from here to harwich, felixstowe, that used to be their run, all run by the  you could  you could get a bus oh you could go down  go on them boats and you go to harwich, felixstowe and then get off at felixstowe and come on the bus if you wanted to."
and these were pleasure?
that was all pleasure boats.
"pleasure boats, but people could use them for just getting around anywhere?"
"yes, yeah there used  there used to be one go down, another one used to be coming up."
was this every day?
every day.
what what did they charge for a trip ?
oh goodness be about one and ninepence.
to go to harwich?
"to go to harwich, yes, they erm, the salvation army, once a year that's where they used to go on their for their treat."
they used to go from here to dovercourt.
"all people that went to the salvation army in  they  they always used to have their treat there, other church always used to go to felixstowe, that used to cost us ninepence to go to felixstowe on the train."
on the train?
yeah  felixstowe.
why did they bother going?
"and at one  one erm, they was er the other one was the clements church hall used to go to felixstowe but the er, the other one the memorial hall down the bottom of  down er  that was just off er  down there we they couldn't afford to go to felixstowe, so we went on cobbles meadow down here, that's what we had then."
"when you say cobbles meadow down here, where do you mean?"
"well that's near cobbles , that's where the, there is a football pitch down the bottom of cliff lane."
oh that's down by the dock?
"that's right there's a  that used to be an old meadow, that's all it used to be, course now, they've got a nice football pitch on it now."
is that  place now?
place.
that's their football pitch?
that's their football pitch there.
going back to dredging.
you talked about the new cut?
"yes, well the new cut, you see, years ago,they used to be the entrance to the dock."
"cos if you if anybody go down there now they could see where what we call the pier head, so ships had to go up there and turn in to the lock gate."
"now, the lock gates are right,the river, so they can come up  straight in, previous they used to have to go up, up the river there, new cut and then turn into the dock."
so there were no lock gates originally ?
"there were no lock, no lock gates this end."
"no, that's a long while before my time."
did you have to do any dredging up there?
"yeah, we done dredging up there."
we just skimmed it off.
when did they put the  the new.
the new lock gates?
yeah.
"oh goodness knows, i mean that them gates have been renewed and i remember them being renewed, these gates what they got there now."
"they must have been renewed somewhere about the erm  i would say roughly round about nineteen twenty seven, twenty eight and that's been renewed as lock gates, cos they took 'em out and they had a big crane come from rotterdam to lift them up and er  things  do now well that's surprising what they do do now."
"i mean, that i known, these people down here now have  the old dredger what they got here now."
"they  they fix it up with wires and they got so far and as the tide rise, cos the ship come up and  they take 'em out and take 'em to the dock, take 'em out with a heavy crane."
mm mm.
"see  lot of these jobs are done by the tide, say you take a ship now what's been sunk in the river, at low tide they'll put the wires underneath, make them fast to the ships and when the tide  when the tide rise out come the ship, and they can take it where they want to."
how many feet does the tide rise down at this dock?
"about, roughly round about er twelve feet in the river."
in the river?
"and rise and fall about twelve feet, they tell you in that new book you've got there, the rise and fall."
how deep did you used to dredge it out?
"well we dredged it, alongside of cliff quay, that was twenty eight feet of water at low tide, that was  that's what they guarantee, what they call  and then  two blasts off, two ships was laying  that'd be at twenty eight feet, then that would rise ten feet below what they call , cos all in metres now."
what's a docksill?
a docksill is what that  takes.
"whatever the tide states at the lock gates, the the channel is  dredged ten feet below that."
ten feet deeper.
"and who used to work all this out, your father?"
"no, the harbourmaster used to do that."
"he'd tell him, he'd get his orders from the office, cos the deputy harbourmaster he would go down all the sound  he  sound in river and see what wanted taken out, then he'd say to my father i'll dredge at so and so below docksill and docksill what they used to do they used to, my father what he'd do he'd put stakes on the mud, a short stake and a long stake the tide and he'd, he'd make an imaginary  on that stake, then he'd go ashore at wolverston, phone up  what have you got on your docksill, the fella might say it's ten feet, well he'd say right we'll make that twenty feet, so that's er, that's what he used to work dredge the river."
"used to dredge the channel out, how, how wide did the channel have to be?"
all different widths.
"what, why different widths?"
well i don't know that's just  enough room for a ship to get up.
"i mean the narrowest part of the river i would say is er where hall bridge is, that's the narrowest part."
and how wide is that?
"well could be about seventy five yards i think, that's to see that."
and you did this with a three foot wide bucket?
yes.
so it must have taken a long while?
"yes, surprising, it's surprising how far you went ahead."
"i mean seven years continual dredging for seven years a month they in dock and you were taking out eight hundred tonne every hopper load and some days you were doing five loads and sometimes four loads, was a lot of mud  we dumped so much mud out at erm near the cork lightship, now you would think they would level theirself off wouldn't you and if they didn't that  up."
"what they have to do, have to go further off now, when they are dredging now they have to go further off into the sea, north sea."
why did it build up?
"well cos at er, there weren't enough tide to take it away, i mean you you get clay well that's, that's solid and the amount of stuff i was dredge  they use and use it, now we're not the only ones got it, they got people from harwich, people from felixstowe, they were all dumping out there."
that silts up again then doesn't it when you dredged it up?
"and that silts up  and cos you get the silt, well i think it silted up about three feet in about three years, that weren't much and the.. course  to come up now."
"with  with dredged up pieces of rocks bigger than that erm machine, bigger than yes, that one yeah."
bigger than the sideboard?
"yeah, bigger than that."
what's that about  three foot by two foot?
yes.
and you've dredged up pieces of rock?
"and we'd dredge 'em up and they  and they used to pick 'em up on a bucket, go in there, pick 'em on a bucket and them going over, the tumbler, into the harbour, we used to have to put a chain round and  'em off, cos if not they'd have gone over them, tumbler and damaged the chute."
er what sort of  just ordinary ?
well they've got them all outside the erm lock gates now.
up on the shore what we dredged up.
do they?
yeah.
outside the lock gates?
"outside the lock gates, just as you go into into  near the erm customs hut, the customs place, near the lock gates, all the rock  now is what we dredged up years and years ago."
"i didn't know that,."
yeah.
just sit there.
"that's still there now, cos they used to take it up there and dump it when it weren't any good."
did you often dredge rock up?
"oh goodness yes,we if we dredged up, we'd have a say a piece of  on deck, we used to land them on deck until we got room, so we came up at upper dock."
"there might be a yachtsman come along and he'd want a mooring, so he'd say to my father, can you fix us up  yes, get an old bit of chain and put round, put some wooden wedges in tighten 'em up,up, that's his, that's his mooring, he'd take it somewhere in the river, have it dumped, put a buoy on it, that was, that's like his anchor."
so that was quite handy then.
"handy, that was a little bit of did it."
perks of the job?
yeah.
certainly had.
you spoke earlier about dredging teeth and bones up of animals.
whereabouts were they dredged up?
preston.
at preston.
the peat.
"now er clay pipes, we used to dredge up and they got dredged up down opposite pinmill, and they were a long pipe, but cos the, the stem a lot of them had been broken off and how they got down there nobody know, i think they used to be like in ballast with the  ships, i think."
like there weren't any old boys on there they used to wash 'em out you know and clean them up then smoke 'em.
an old clay pipe.
did they really?
"then you used to be able to buy clay pipes, i don't think you could today."
no.
"but er a lot of 'em used to erm,used to smoke 'em."
they used to come up with the dredging spoil.
with the dredger yes.
we we dredged some off erm halfway to the by the  near pinmill.
what happened to the bones and the teeth you you collected?
the teeth there used to be a man come down about once every three months and er where he came from i don't know.
"whether he come from this  or not, but erm we were dredging the west bank cos er the kind of ship we got there then were the big tankers and there weren't enough room for them to swing round, so we had to dredge part of the bank out to make the swinging berth and erm there we dredged a bone up about that size."
what was that about.
and.
four foot ?
"yeah that's a big and my and that stuck out the bucket like that, well going over the top we had a hood over the top tumbler to stop the  flashing, so my father stopped, thinking that was a bit of wood and were gonna break the top of the tumbler, so he stop and  out and scrubbed it and found that was this bone and i think if my memory serve me right that's in the, the fleet museum now."
you don't know what it came off?
"no, they reckon that was an elephant, i don't know  so the yarn went."
all we see all different bits of bone.
what else did you get?
"lot of sewage but the, the, the, the sewage ."
"that was terrible that was, cos that's where a lot of their stuff was dumped, in the river at one time, cos now that's all taken to sea."
"did any of the, the teeth and the bones erm."
like a deer's like a deer's jaw.
a whole jaw?
"yeah, a whole jaw."
"you  part of the horn, you dredged them up, cos you used the only thing we saw  taken out, then this old fella used to come down from the museum or whatever he was and he used to be pleased he'd stay there all day and pick up them all."
did you get many?
good few.
do you know if they still dredge them up these days or.
oh i think they do.
mm.
"see well the dredger they get now, the little dredger they got now that should hold about four hundred ton ."
"the mud they put out now there is lucky if they put two hundred ton in and that's only had by grab and course they'd make a hole there, then course that fill up again."
that's how they do  dredging now.
they make the hole?
"yeah,when the grab go in, you see them, that's making a hole isn't it."
mm.
"and course then the sides cave in again  and that's the idea they can keep it down level, or try to."
so is that a better way of doing it?
"no the only, i would say personally, i would say the best dredging method is buckets because you can, you can keep a level, you could keep a level with a sucker dredger but not a ground dredger  unless  like grabbing  out the hole."
"er er in hole that's like that and you're grabbing out, well you're only making a hole and fill in again but they  into that one place don't they."
"like down at the erm, when i was crane driving, we used to have ships coming from casablanca, with phosphate in and then there be a, another part there was  sulphur , then they used to be erm, there's green oar, what we used to call."
green oar?
green oar.
what's that?
"well that's a very heavy stuff, that's a er is er like er erm, oh a heavy little lead."
is it a metal?
"er a well i don't know, i feel that there used to be something in that, that  used to burn it up now what they call their top site and when they burned it they took all the acid it, and there used to be all yellow stuff come out the chimney and that, when they finished burn that was always red and the germans used to come after that before the war, second world war, they used to come after that and they used to reckon they make paintwork but now you done something else different with it and they i tell you we used to give it the name of green oar or parites."
parites.
parites yeah.
do you remember the second world war at the docks.
what it was like?
"yes, i was a crane driver then."
you moved on from being on the dredger?
no i was made off .
i moved off the dredger in nineteen thirty two and i was crane driving from nineteen thirty two till after the war.
why did you finish on the dredger?
"well cos they finished, they ain't got enough money."
so they.
"they, they packed the  and sold it."
so this was the dock commission?
"yes, dock commission sold the dredger, they sold the hoppers and then last the steam hopper went from here to harwich and what they done at harwich they, on the foredeck,see a big hopper, what we call hopper number three, they put a crane on there and use it as a  hopper then and."
and did they continue dredging?
"and the dredger went to erm hull, that's where it went to, to be broken up."
who did the dredging after that then?
well the .
"they're a big, they're a big dredging company from london."
if they want their dredging done they got them people in which cost more money.
that seems odd really that they paid.
"right, yeah it does, i mean there were,that's how things went."
was that er erm a depressing time at the docks.
"that was, yes."
at nineteen thirty two?
"that was because i mean you take now the, the, the dredging company what they call the  in their funnel they used to have erm a square and in halves that used to be a blue and a yellow."
"that was our marking, all our ships used to have the blue and er i think blue  and yellow in the square, cos they hired these  the people who do er you know suppose hire them off now would be the erm the dutch people cos they're the people what er, they deal in all that type of thing, big dredging, that's how rotterdam was built."
by dredging?
by dredging.
reclaimed land.
why was times bad in nineteen thirty two for the dock?
pardon?
why were times bad for the dock in nineteen thirty two?
"well that's one of those things, like it is today you see, unemployment and new trade coming in and all the rest of that."
why wasn't the trade coming in?
"people didn't want it, weren't the money about, investments i suppose."
"so from there you moved being, being a crane driver?"
i went crane driving.
mm mm what did that involve?
"well the first crane i drove was a  was only  at that  so i was stuck on one of them and i had to sling me grab all the time and this, this bridge come round and miss the bridge and go over it and rush it  down to the hold."
was that difficult?
it was difficult cos you only had what they we call the joystick behind me and i used to work that and i used to be.
"turn the crane round one way then the other and he got on the same lever but today they got, cos they got big lovely cranes where they stand there with four levers, four controls they've got and it goes up and down."
and the jib goes up and down quite easily.
"i see what sort of crane did you call them, the new ones?"
these are luffing cranes.
loving?
.
luffing?
l u f f i n g .
they're the modern ones.
"they're the modern ones, luffing cranes."
the old cranes sounded quite dangerous.
"they were yes, well you could swing them grabs out and come  the wire still."
were there ever any accidents with them?
oh goodness yes.
what.
i done plenty of damage.
you did?
i got threatened with the sack once.
what did you do?
"well i went through a ship's bridge, broke the wheel up top, i did, cos you, at that time, see  how things improve all the time, now  jib and all , that's thirty five feet long."
"mine was only twenty feet long, the one i was driving, twenty feet long jib."
"now on that twenty feet long, now i'm up about say, you can say anything like about fifteen feet up in the  in the air, might be less than that and then you got twenty feet up like that, well then there used to be wire and used to have a big wheel in top, which you couldn't go over the top and  with a wire, then i used to have a sling chain, my main hook and that was thirteen foot long and you take that and on, on working the lorry, see you got to be so careful and there's men working on that lorry , course i broke the  wheel."
what happened?
"they got a new one, they had another, then they had another idea then, they came round and had erm, had, turned round and said, right they done away with part of the wire and they got another big wheel so you can go right over the top next time, they done away with the big hook, so you could shackle your, your chain the wire, then you could go right over the top and then they get the old short chains like that."
"thirteen foot six, they got little short chains like better."
did you get into trouble for breaking.
"trouble yeah, trouble i got put off for a fortnight, on the dole, then he, i was on the dole for a week and er he cos at that time you had to appear the erm, what they call the court of referees at the labour exchange, that was their committee."
"you had to appear them, well this, i'd been off for a week  and the old harbourmaster old  he sent for me and he said erm, you can start work tomorrow as i ."
"right i said i'll start tomorrow morning, i go to the labour this afternoon, court of referees."
"yes, he said, i should go, and he wouldn't come, cos he ain't got no answer to it you see, anyway i went and i started back the next morning, he called me back."
that one alright.
was it usual to be stood off if you did something wrong for the ?
"oh goodness, yes  for the damage and you had to go the harbourmaster."
this was the ipswich dock commission ?
ipswich dock commission coo dear.
"and they would generally stand you off work for a while, that was your punishment?"
"that's punishment, yeah, they would either do that or there was one driver down there  he broke a wheel, that weren't his fault, and he had to pay for it, he had to go in the office like i did once."
"i had to go in the office every friday night and i was only earning about two pounds seventeen and six a week and they and deputy harbourmaster, captain , he say, how much you earned this week he  say, three pound, i'm asking you four he say, well they'd take it off you  and er you'd be paying it now, takes about six months, and he  old harbourmaster see you about the quay he said."
want you in the office and he'd give it all back again.
did he really?
"he only done, they only done that to learn you a lesson."
yeah.
"dear oh dear, cos he weren't allowed, he weren't allowed to stop money, cos that's against the law to pay for damages."
didn't they ever get caught out then?
"no, no, he daren't say anything cos if you got, you said anything you got the bloody sack."
did you have any union?
pardon?
did you have any union?
"oh yeah  yeah, i had a union."
"and didn't, didn't the union question why they were taking money?"
"no  well i did, old, old erm what's his name now coo dear  there was one old boy he, he, he well he  union on this court of referees and er cos we got to hear of it."
"somebody said, well the harbourmaster's not coming, i said, right  go back to work and that's the time i, that's the time when we had the first baby and erm, that's the first one we lost and anyhow they put me off for a fortnight and erm i went down to, i say go up the board of guardians, that was like the d h s s but lower and i just start to buy this house  soon as i said to this bloke, he live in the council house this bloke, what was interviewing me."
"where do you live, i say  oh you're buying your own house?"
"i said yeah just started, course if i'd have paid money off i said  lived on it you see."
mm.
"and there be twenty eight shillings a week, that's all i allowed him and because that was even better than labour money and so  the day, they, i had to keep that they stopped all me labour, so cos i had the money you see."
they stopped that?
"they stopped it see, so i didn't gain anything it, me mates at work they made a collection for me in their way ."
did the union act for you at this particular time then?
"oh, they did yes oh yes."
"what i was wondering was when you said that the dock stopped the money for payment for damages, they'd paid it back to you."
didn't the union question why they ?
"no, no, no none of that, union didn't know we were paying."
"because i knew, the fella that done the damage before i did  the same thing, he said to me, he say you carry on  you'll get it back."
and so you never told the union?
so i didn't tell the union.
how much.
"so he say they'll give it to you back  so that's what they done they give me me money back, cos they'd already give him back his, you see."
yeah.
were there ever any strikes at the docks?
"oh, goodness yeah but now they, even today, i mean they have a strike and that's settled just like that."
is it?
"yes, goodness."
was it not settled quickly before.
when you were there?
"no, no it weren't, not when a general strike in nineteen twenty six, that was a bad one."
that's when everybody came out together was it ?
"everybody come out, yes."
well were there ever any strikes that have just affected the docks?
"no, not really."
i mean i've known little strikes there last about a couple of days and they all got over it.
they always used to give way to 'em.
"what would, what would they have been over?"
"anything, more money, that was the main thing, more money."
and they wouldn't last that long?
"no, no, cos you had, see they, these big people they didn't wanna be into it they  same getting their money, like  and  and ,,, they didn't want strikes."
"they always used to, all used to finish up down here any rate."
alright give 'em it.
didn't that encourage more strikes though?
"no it didn't, no the people,the dockers were pretty reasonable, they were  now i will say that dockers  pretty reasonable."
"that's what i say to a lot of people today, they moan about dockers  but they're only fighting for their rights."
that's all.
mm.
i mean lot of my children go over the limit but erm they stir up too much .
but that was er.
that was er.
give and take.
"give and take, was yes."
"cos there's some, they used to be carrying timber down the dock  all one length and what  already slung, already stacked for 'em and the way it cost, the way it go  put the wires on me now and there ain't much to let now."
you mention  a little while ago.
who were ?
they were timber merchants.
"they used to saw timber down for planks and that, they had er place in hull and a place in ipswich."
that was.
where were they positioned on the dock?
they were down at cliff quay.
"they were, that's where  is now."
"cos , they sold out the , that's all  now and i think  came from yarmouth, they used, they used to have a big place at yarmouth and we came through the other week and er i see their sheds are nearly all empty now, there."
what at the  yarmouth?
at yarmouth.
"but as i say there ain't er, there ain't the timber used to, what there used to be ."
"down at  there was one ship down there, that  six weeks  move."
"what was, what were you unloading?"
"timber, that were all loose timber  that was during the war, six weeks, six weeks that took to unload that ship."
that's a long while isn't it?
that was yeah.
"that always used to be a fortnight to three weeks to unload a ship but this one  ship, that was called, i remember that was called the  lovely ship and that had been bombed, that had a bomb drop right on the ."
"course and the bomb gone on the  broke the winches and that, and that had gone so far, you know, that timber, that has crushed the timber all, more or less all together."
all the cargo inside was damaged?
yeah.
where did this happen in the channel?
"in the channel, well, it was coming over i suppose from america."
did you have many boats coming in bomb damaged?
"yes we had one or two, we had one coal boat come in,damaged."
hello.
hello doctor.
hello anna.
what can i do for you tonight?
"so help us,in here the back of my neck, and across here."
elbows.
oh oh.
neuralgia.
and all down my.
"down my, see even here doctor."
aye.
my fingers and that you know?
right.
sometimes i feel i cannae stand it.
down there.
excuse me.
.
"see in here in my neck, too."
aye.
mhm.
"it's sometimes when i  turn round, oh dear aha."
you feel it.
aha.
catching there?
"aye, right."
mhm.
aye.
"that's a that's a neuralgia, a, a slight."
is it?
inflammation on the nerves.
mhm.
where they come down there.
aha.
and they go through.
.
aha.
right.
okay.
i'm not going to  poke about.
aha.
but er that's right.
"right down here, across here, right there, here."
that's right .
"and i thought across here too, terrible  here."
here  it was gonna .
and see my elbows?
like a toothache.
my elbows were sore.
that's right.
that's right.
"and everything, you know in behind the ear here, i felt my head was."
aye.
swollen.
"from here, right up over."
aye.
"the top,."
aha.
"and then from there right down the back,."
yeah.
across the.
aha.
"shoulders, around the front here,."
aha.
"down here, into your elbows,."
aye.
with a toothache and then right down  your fingers.
"then your fingers, aha, aye."
"now doctor, i was up, i had that terrible pain across here,."
mhm.
"i thought i was taking a heart attack, but er doctor  gave me a rub of that."
diflam.
diflam?
diflam.
yes.
aha.
that's right.
"so would i, would i still use that or what do you think, painkillers or what doctor?"
"no there is a, there's a special stuff i'm going to give you."
is there?
to get rid of this for you.
now the other thing that very often goes with this is  a  crunching noise.
that's right.
"when you, when you move your neck."
see sometimes well not all the time.
no no.
no.
but sometimes you feel it's going to jerk you.
"yeah, that's right."
you know you're not going to be  able to move it any.
and it's going to stay that way.
"no, anna, you're alright."
you're alright.
now   you're still working?
"yes, aha."
"ah, right."
take these tablets just at bedtime.
aha.
don't take them during the day.
"just two of these  you can either take one after your cup of tea, and one before you go to bed."
"bed, aha."
or you can leave them both till bedtime.
aha.
that'll .
yeah.
aha.
"that's fine, aha."
okay?
"right, doctor , that's fine."
"that's er  but that is where the, the nerve."
aha.
"from up here,."
mhm.
where it splits into all the.
mhm.
aye.
wee bits.
is that  that kind of a swelling you get that swelling ?
"aye, that swelling at the side there."
er this is the fourteenth of the fourth .
there we are now.
that's fine doctor .
that should get rid of that for you.
"now, this will come back."
mhm.
"it might come back in six months, in might come back in six years."
mhm.
nobody can tell you.
no.
but it keeps coming back .
i thought maybe it was a kind of arthritic you know kind of.
no no.
"an arthritis kind of a thing, you know."
well it's not.
it's not.
"er the other, the other thing."
"cos i've a gammy knee ,."
"see when i kneel see when i kneel a lot,."
let's have a wee look.
i can hardly.
and see what you've done to the poor thing.
"i don't know, there's a young doctor, but i cannae remember what she says, but see when i kneel a lot, doctor."
mhm.
it's awfully hard to straighten them you know?
aye.
"just let your, let your foot rest on the floor, anna."
yeah.
you can see there's been  a wee bit of damage to that ligament  just where it goes down over the top of that bone.
mhm.
just in here.
"aye, well it's just."
over .
i mean it's not sore when i'm walking or anything doctor.
no.
"no, that's right."
"it's just, she's, i think, i cannae remember what she says, something about nodules on the kneecap or something."
"that's just a wee  nodules on your kneecap,."
mhm.
"she says they, she said they wouldn't really do anything with that unless."
no.
the knee bent and you couldn't straighten it.
"no, leave that alone."
mhm.
leave that alone.
"they'll come and go as well,."
right.
"they'll, they'll, they'll not ."
they won't they won't come to that.
"as i say, it doesn't bother me constantly all the time, doctor  you know, it's just i feel  i was carrying some shopping down the road."
mhm.
"you know,keep  secret."
oh!
that's right.
that's right you feel you want to rub it all the time.
goodness.
terrible isn't it?
this is old age coming .
old age doesn't come itself so they say.
och well.
"och well, that's it."
"if that's all, if that's all we get for getting old,we'll do ."
that's it.
"well that's fine, we'll do."
we'll do.
"okay, look after yourself now."
right.
thank you.
right?
cheerie-bye.
cheerio now.
books are are written by ex-examiners and  have a have several specimen answers.
they have here is an answer is too  in an exam.
this one's excellent because these are the .
alright yeah.
"this one erm he tried hard and put a lot in, thinks he should get full marks but he's not going to get very much because he's missed this, he's not answering that properly."
yeah.
and he said that.
"but it's very good to see where people go wrong and to er help you get it right, and that one is the one ."
is it like that in this one?
what's that?
my.
"ah  , are showing how people answer different, how they got."
erm yes er yeah .
how  marks.
"and right, electricity."
okay what's erm the difference between a metal and a non-metal?
erm metal and non-metal.
erm  a non-metal is  a metal's a solid no?
most metals are solid.
erm can you think of a one metal which isn't a solid at normal temperatures?
no .
find it you might find it in a thermometer.
mercury.
right.
right.
so  solid  non-metals .
some of them are solid some of them aren't.
er physical properties of metals.
what will metals do?
what can metals do very well that non-metals can't do?
erm  well they're hard so they can erm  make things.
because they're.
you can make things.
right.
.
you can make things with them.
solids .
good.
they're hard you can make things them.
erm a lot of them are shiny.
how do you make  erm how do you make wire?
with metal.
okay.
how do you make it with the metal?
what do you do with the metal to make wire it?
heat it melt it.
you don't need to heat it they just there's a bar of it and they pull it.
oh right yeah .
pull it through a tiny hole.
stick it through a dye.
mm.
so it's if you can pull it out it's ductile.
mm.
have you ever tried hammering any metals?
no.
lead or soft metals you can hammer them into shape.
seen anyone beating a car panel it's got.
yeah.
a dent and they're beating it.
yeah.
so they're malleable.
you can hammer them into shape.
right.
they're ductile malleable don't need the proper words you just say they can be pulled out.
"if you try that with erm a piece of wood, you try to pull it out into a long thin wire it would just break."
try it.
yeah.
with a piece of china or something like that it'll just break .
right.
"all metals will stretch out, it'll get thinner  ductile."
malleable you can batter it.
right.
into shape.
so those are the some of the physical properties.
have fairly high melting points.
some of them not as high as the non-metals but most of have got to get to a few hundred degrees c before they start .
erm some of the uses of metals.
tell me some.
"oh erm, the uses of metals."
what actually what erm oh god.
what could you use metals for?
er anything computers.
right right.
so you can use them for it's cos you can draw it out you can make wires it.
you can shape it into almost anything.
you can make very specially shaped  for.
yeah.
almost anything.
but there's another another use of metals  erm two sticks about say about  one's made of wood and one's made of copper.
erm someone's going to heat one end and then hold the other end.
which one would you rather hold?
copper.
wood.
oh!
we'll try it.
no the wood one.
why?
"because wood takes longer to burn, copper would  just you would you could you would feel the heat you had if."
right.
you held the the end.
the wood would be the first to burn but you wouldn't feel much.
wouldn't feel anything.
no.
holding the end of the wood.
but holding the copper after a few seconds the heat all the heat'd be transmitted through.
yeah.
to your hands.
conducted it.
mm.
so metals are?
conductors.
good conductors of?
go on.
good conductors of what?
good conductors of.
well what's it just been conducting?
electricity.
"good, that's another one."
good conductors of heat.
heat yeah.
and good conductors of electricity.
mm.
"or we sometimes just say, good conductors."
so what about the insulators the non-conductors?
can you think of any of those?
"materials which are very good at stopping electricity, stopping heat getting through."
"if if a material conducts electricity well, it conducts heat well because it's very there there there they work on the same process."
if it's an insulator it stops heat getting through and it'll stop electricity getting through .
mm.
so can you think of any good insulators?
erm  erm.
oh oh yes.
erm.
erm have you got an ironing board?
yeah.
got to put the iron down on .
on plastic.
so there's a special little bit that you put the iron down on.
oh metal.
is it metal?
i dunno.
erm sometimes it's asbestos.
right.
er  the plug and the cable going to any electrical appliance.
mm.
erm how does it conduct electricity?
what's what's what's inside that wire that conducts electricity?
a fuse.
"no, that  what's the wire made of inside?"
erm no it's not zinc is it?
copper?
okay good copper.
it's a metal.
"inside there's a metal, but it's not just two bare wires is it?"
no.
so what's wrapped round the bare wires?
erm protector so it won't it doesn't erm it slows it down.
does it slow it down?
cos if you had just if you didn't have the thing erm over the wire it would just burn right through very quickly.
so  is it you've seen you've wired a plug haven't you?
yeah.
well.
you've always got something covering the wire haven't you ?
got something covering the wire.
what is it?
plastic.
right.
so the plastic is there because it's a good insulator.
yeah.
if you covered the wire with more metal say you put two pieces of wire spare wire.
mm.
"or wrap some aluminium foil round these to protect them, not going to be much good."
no.
aluminium's a good conductor.
yeah.
very good conductor.
erm so plastic is an insulator.
mm.
glass ceramic most of the non-metals are good insulators.
somewhere in are a very interesting group called semiconductors.
have you heard of those?
i have yeah.
yep and they're probably nowadays as more important than the conductors.
and that's what we use for electronic circuits.
so semiconductors are things that sort of conduct and don't.
yeah.
erm.
.
they just need a little push to make them go one way or the other so.
mm.
"that we can control, we can say turn on turn off whether they let the electricity go through or not."
"erm so semiconductors  erm tell me about an electrical circuit, how it works."
well you have if you're doing an electric circuit you've got to have a er a bulb and a switch.
mm.
and batteries to to do the circuit and you can have erm volts in it .
okay what are what are volts?
"volts erm it's a term used for electricity,."
okay.
volts.
"right, what sort of electricity?"
currents.
the current of the electricity.
good.
doesn't have to be current but it usually is.
best thing to do is to draw a little picture erm  so what does volts measure?
the amount of electricity that's going.
yeah.
"it measure the the potential, erm  i've got a three volt battery in there, somewhere cos i'm working."
"i'm going to make you hold one end there's the there's the battery, going to make you put one finger on one terminal the other finger your other hand on the other one."
mm.
one and half volts.
is that going to kill you?
no.
no.
erm drive it with erm a hundred and thirty two thousand volts?
yes.
okay.
the high voltage.
why?
what's what's the difference then?
well it's got a higher voltage.
yeah what's what does that mean?
why is that.
it's.
going to be?
well it's higher on electricity it'll give me an electric shock.
mhm.
how does it do it?
it goes through your nervous system.
okay.
into you're arteries.
right.
and your heart.
right.
"so it'll go through you and it'll paralyze your muscles, so you stop breathing and your heart stops."
mm.
"and effectively, it's like drowning."
mm.
erm  get your heart started again.
so that's another good point erm you know what to do if someone's had an electric shock?
don't touch them.
right.
cos they'll still have electricity.
okay.
on them.
"you don't touch them, what do you do?"
turn off all the mains.
good.
erm get a stick or something.
right.
something like a wooden.
wood.
stick or.
yeah.
a rope  rope and loop him round.
drag him the actual.
right.
mains.
okay.
and then what do you do?
"when you've got them the mains, what d'ya do with them?"
erm god i've done a first  aid course.
erm  what do you do?
right erm.
could you still touch them if you've pulled them the mains and everything?
yeah.
once you're sure you've pulled them away.
"but as you say, switch off first and then still use a stick or something to get them away because it maybe the switch doesn't work and maybe that's why they've been electrocuted in the first place."
cos they thought it was switched off.
yeah.
and it wasn't.
so get them the mains and then what do you do?
erm do the quick a b c.
"right, good and erm."
"check the airway , check the breathing, check."
yeah.
the circulation.
and just treat it as a.
yeah.
erm.
just try and get their heart beat started.
get them breathing started because the the longest they've been paralysed er.
try and get some oxygen in there.
get that going and  ring for an ambulance.
yeah.
erm  so what's volts all about?
"well it takes a while to explain, but i'll try and do it quickly."
"erm let's see  this is a reservoir of water, right?"
mm.
erm if the water's very high and say we have a little a little pipe coming through there in the bottom .
what's that?
that's the dam.
"oh right, yeah."
so that's the that's the wall and this is the water.
right.
"now if the water's water level is fairly low, there'll just be a little trickle coming out here."
mm.
"if there's a lot of water in the dam, right up there, just pull the plug out here it's going to really shoot out."
yeah.
be a lot of pressure there because there's a lot of height.
mm.
of water.
well you can think of the height of the water as like a voltage.
mm.
"it tells you it's called potential volts, measures potential."
"it measures electrical potential, you can just call it potential."
"and if you think of what potential it's got erm like this squirt, if you like."
if you.
mm.
"now if we have a little hole in there, we'll only get a little bit of water coming out, sort of."
pressure isn't it?
"well let's say let's say we've got a fixed pressure now, we're not going to mess about with the height of the water, it's a constant hundred feet or so."
so if we've got a a tiny hole not much water is going to get out.
what does.
no.
come out will be really squirting out.
but not much water will get through.
"when we had a great big hole in the bottom of the dam,."
more pressure.
a lot of water would come through.
well that hole is like resistance.
yeah.
"right, so if we've got a lot of volts, so lot of volts, that gives a lot of current."
and what's current?
"current you can think of as the amount of water that actually gets through, the."
mm.
"amount of the amount of electricity that actually gets through,."
mm.
and the resistance.
"if we've got high resistance, what do you think will happen with a high resistance?"
they'll be a lot of current.
"with a high resistance it's resisting the current, it's stopping the current."
"oh right, yeah."
"okay, so high resistance gives low current."
low current.
and obviously a low resistance.
will give a high current.
gives a high current.
a low resistance is a big hole.
a high resistance is if there's a tiny little peep hole.
yeah.
it was trying to force through that.
yeah.
"the current is you can think of it as the amount of water goes through, it's actually the the current is the amount of electrons that get through in a second."
so i've got someone here on the the dam counting the electrons as they go past.
"well  lots through to day, cos there's the big hole or there's a lot of pressure."
"so if you have a lot of a lot of pressure, a lot of a lot of volts."
mm.
"and a big hole which will give a low resistance, you get a terrific amount."
yeah.
going through.
if you have a big hole but only tiny little voltage then you won't get much going through.
so.
so it's er always the opposite.
volts the more volts the more current.
yeah.
"but resistance, the more resistance."
stops it.
the less you get through .
yeah.
so the current.
reduces.
the current is going to be something like multiplied by the voltage.
right.
"so if it's got ten times the voltage, you'll get ten ten times the current through."
which is why one and half volts you know won't do you much harm.
no.
"but assuming your resistance stays the same, your resistance is about one mega  million ohms."
so if your resistance stays the same and we keep increasing the voltage at some stage you say ooh it feels tingly.
mm.
ooh i don't like that.
"that's around erm sixty seventy volts you can say oh don't like that, ninety volts  stop."
erm two forty volts.
"so current times the voltage and then divide by the resistance, so current equals v over r ,."
r.
you've seen that before.
yeah.
you don't usually write c for current because it gets confused with lots of other like capacitance.
so we use i.
erm.
yeah.
that's  but that's basically how electricity works.
and it needs to have a path to get there and back.
so you have a battery  and two terminals on it.
then you have say this goes round to a light bulb    amps.
mm.
doesn't light up.
"the you say oh the electricity can go round there and if it gets  light,."
no  it's not it's not connecting.
but can't flow through it and get back.
so it's not quite the same as this water analogy cos it's got to have somewhere to go all the way round.
yeah.
which is why we call it a circuit.
okay?
erm so if you can try to think about where is the circuit?
"where does it start off from, what what started the battery what pole of the battery."
can it get all the round and back to the  it'll work.
mm.
"if it can't get all the way round cos someone's pulled this wire out, or opened a switch."
that's a short.
or.
"circuit, isn't it?"
it's an open circuit.
oh.
it's an open circuit if there's a bit of a circuit missing.
"oh right, yeah."
circuit is missing.
a short circuit is when somebody takes a short cut.
now there's the battery.
"that's fine, yeah."
"right, there's the battery and electricity's got to go we usually talk of positive current going round this way."
"goes along here and through that big resistance, it's a high resistance."
right?
so it's a little tiny hole it's trying to get through here.
mm.
and it's stopping it.
not much electricity's getting back.
"you've got a big  thick piece of wire across there, join it up."
you're not going to get much current down there .
no.
most of it's going to take the easy way short cut.
"because this looks like, something about this big."
that sort of pipe.
yeah.
so for the the water to go down the current to flow through.
mm.
"so it'll take the short cut, the easy way, making a short circuit."
"won't go the long way round, a short circuit ."
no.
"erm and if did that with a car battery, erm it'll probably explode."
"i've seen erm  a spanner, metal about that thick, vaporize, on the terminals of a car battery."
"it's erm when you start a car, have you ever been in a car when someone's started it up in gear and the car moves forward?"
yeah.
well that's just the battery doing that.
oh right.
so it's got enough power stored in that battery to do that.
"and in a few in a fraction of a second, if you try and if you short it all out, give it a very you know great big wide pipe to rush through, the virtually the whole contents of the electricity of the battery tries to get through that, and a spanner is like that, very."
mm.
"little resistance goes thorough there, heats the metal very rapidly, melts the metals and then turns the turns the molten metal into vapour."
mm.
and explodes.
and usually the battery explodes.
mm.
so don't drop lumps of metal over batteries.
very very dangerous.
yeah.
okay that's the bit about electricity.
let's see.
alright.
where we can pick up some marks.
now tell me what erm  what sort of preparation you did for this.
"well erm we had books like these, topics that we had to cover."
yep.
and er i told mum the other day that in double science we've still got to do one and a half topics.
"and she couldn't believe it cos like, you know, now we've gotta start down getting  some revision,."
mm.
we've still gotta do one and a half topics of these books.
"but erm i looked through the books and erm i wrote down notes and things like that, and i looked through my exercise book."
and erm at the end they have er questions at the end of each topic.
okay.
which helps you.
this is all about the solar system and that.
and erm i just basically did that.
"when you're revising you said the other night, you cover the answers up and try the question."
it's erm really about the only way to do it on problems.
yeah.
"because if you look at a problem, and you read through, have someone to work it out you say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, and that's yeah obvious."
"erm if you have the just the question, and you've got to work it out,it's not so obvious."
mm.
and it's a good way to check if you know it.
right question number two.
nought.
we'll start with that one because because no because should get nought on a question i think.
because there's always something you you think you know something you about it.
a bit of common sense will usually give you some answers.
mm.
like erm people always know a lot more than they think they know.
and they don't want to put down what they do know cos they think it's obvious.
yeah.
"but put it down, they get some marks."
we haven't done about  about circuits.
"ah, right."
"see, mum and i looked a bit up in my book."
right.
"each lamp is fifteen watt, thirty volts."
they arrange them in series and plug them into the mains supply.
"draw a diagram , you didn't."
no.
so you didn't get anything for that.
what is the current through each lamp when they're switched on.
show your working.
two forty volt.
now right okay.
that's  definitely give you one for that.
all fuses can be bought.
which fuse should they put in the plug?
i put  thirteen .
"well,."
mum said usually it's three.
well erm.
"cos there's a lot of  bulbs to light up, so i thought thirteen."
looks.
give it a higher.
it it doesn't really matter erm there's only  give reasons for this choice.
"if stronger   circuits,another bit of."
okay erm  protective device.
what's that oh is this the teacher's?
no i put that in yesterday .
later.
right.
a fuse is not an insulator okay?
it's a conductor.
right.
a fuse again.
it's a deliberate weak link.
let's say you're going to tow erm one car with another car.
"and you've got this good towing rope, you don't want it to snap."
you know when towing ropes sometimes.
mm.
jerk  and they snap.
so you have the towing rope and then you have a little bit of old rope that is weaker than your rope.
mm.
and you use that somewhere in the and you tie that to one car and then join that up.
"if something breaks it's going to be that weak old rope, not."
yeah.
going to be your new tow rope.
well you can think of it like that.
i was i was telling you looking at it from another point of view last night of the  what happens when you put electricity through a wire?
may i pinch one of your cigarettes?
ooh look at that.
yeah.
oh  erm having to put electricity through a wire.
erm it'll either stop the.
little bit of electricity and then make it more and more.
it will increase the electricity will increase through the wire .
right.
okay.
"so you're increasing the electricity, and what happens to the wire?"
melt.
right.
good.
"before it melts i mean we don't normally melt the wires, what but what happens?"
"you notice the erm you've got an electric fire running, what happens to the flex?"
the flex?
what's the flex?
the flexible connection.
the cable.
erm.
the wire that goes to it.
well it won't won't work because it'll be.
it's gets.
too hot .
"so whenever electricity whenever electricity goes through a conductor, usually a wire, the wire gets warm."
mm.
"erm the electricity every every bit of wire has got some resistance and erm electricity will be struggling through, warms it up."
"er what happens in a light bulb, when you switch on?"
the electricity flows through and lights.
the bulb up.
why does it light up?
because electricity's been there's a bit in the bulb that.
how does it how does it make light?
how does how does it light?
the little bulb inside the actual glass bulb.
"right, something there's something inside the glass bulb and what happens to it?"
well electricity flows through it.
right and what happens when electricity flows through this little coiled coil of wire ?
lights up.
why does it light up?
i don't know.
"i mean the erm your hair dryer doesn't light up when you put electricity through it, does it?"
have you ever seen your hair dryer light up?
no.
you have actually i'm sure.
have you ever looked down into the hair dryer?
heat.
right and you see it red.
yeah.
especially if it's if as when it first turns on or if the the fan heater is not blowing very much.
"and the you see bits of the element glowing red,."
mm.
"if you if you don't with a hair dryer if you weren't blowing the air over it, what happens?"
or say a fan heater erm a  fan heater in the bathroom.
mm.
it happened to that the other day.
erm as i say it turned the the element on but no fan blowing air over it to cool it.
did it melt?
"overheats and it would melt, so that they put a little protector thing cut out a thermal cut out to stop the current flowing."
mm.
or it would just melt.
"so light bulb, when you turn on it gets warm, then it gets hot, then it gets red hot, then it gets white hot."
it gets so hot it's giving off a lot of light erm light bulbs are hot to touch.
mm.
"yes, so they're."
yeah.
giving off heat and  quite a bit of that heat is coming off as light.
right.
so they're deliberately made so we get light them.
"erm  that's ohm's law is part of the question, question two."
and to work out any of the volt or.
right.
"amps amps is current, right?"
yeah.
so we'll go back to ohm's law here.
current is volts divided by resistance.
"right current in amps, let's give you two, volts and do you know what we measure resistance in?"
erm no.
i do know but i i should know .
okay.
on her majesty's service.
ohms.
ohms!
yeah that's it.
called.
yeah.
who's law it was.
now so on that one.
"well  they give you they even give you from that by manipulating then equations you can derive other equations, you come up with other equations."
that's one of the equations that you come up with.
okay?
so  current is equal to volt is equal to power divided by volt.
mm.
right.
erm  current which one.
how many marks next question?
three.
okay.
erm   there's quite a bit to go into with that but that's hopefully given you some idea of how electricity works.
mm.
the equations they will give you in the book are in that one.
erm they give it er you just have to know what power is.
power is the wattage.
mm.
so erm  electric motors are measured in power.
wattage.
mm.
mopeds.
"you know when you've got a moped,plate on it?"
mm.
and it'll say so many kilowatts.
mm.
it's just a measurement of power.
right.
so instead of measuring horsepower you're measuring kilowatts.
erm okay.
let's have a look at two papers.
"right, you've got a lot of twos on that one."
couple of fives on this.
five on number five.
"right again electricity here, you didn't get two marks   electricity board could use wind generated power in several ways."
so when there isn't any wind you can use the thermal power stations instead.
you're something funny by using .
saving.
yeah.
erm   i mean i wouldn't necessarily agree with all these markings because everybody who marks the markings are sometimes slightly different.
yeah.
but erm that's a that's a reasonable answer.
two three.
what fuels may be used in thermal power stations?
"two three there, so fossil fuels, nuclear reactor, wind and what's the other energy source that you can use?"
well not wind.
solar.
"yeah, what fuels need thermal power stations?"
solar power.
erm thermal is the fuel that you're heating.
so that's like  erm they use gas power stations .
yeah.
so they're probably looking for both fossil fuels which includes gas.
"okay, so i think you've got, definitely got the idea there."
yeah.
that's okay.
now are you alright on charts?
bar charts?
"yeah, if you turn over i've got eighteen twenty two."
brilliant.
good that's good.
because that's that's a thing that will apply to all subjects.
so if.
mm.
you're good at that you can get marks in lots of subjects.
yeah i'm i'm alright on that.
just on that.
okay.
"that was all about smoking so   oh yeah, what's a load in a river?"
i've got a question.
l o a d?
"yeah, there."
yeah.
i looked it up but i couldn't.
erm if you look at a river that's working  running quickly down from the mountains.
mm.
to the sea.
"it's carrying with it a lot of soil, bits of rock,."
mm.
that's it's load.
"i put the impact of the river, she didn't."
mm.
give me any marks.
no.
no.
it's it's also called the .
it's what it carries down to the.
mm.
sea.
"when it gets to the sea, it slows down."
when.
mm.
"it slows down it drops a lot of the silt, mud and rocks."
so higher up it's dropping the rocks.
mm.
as it gets slower and slower it can only carry smaller and smaller particles.
mm.
"by the time it gets to the sea then it's slowed down a lot, it's usually carrying very fine silt ,."
mm.
which it drops as mud.
and the mud creeps out further and builds a delta.
mhm.
er the nile delta or the ganges or the mississippi delta.
yeah.
okay so that's what the load is.
the.
right.
stuff that it's.
the stuff that.
just the load it's.
carrying .
yeah.
erm   so you could pick a few up a few marks on that.
hmm.
"yes, good answer."
take it to an expert who'll tell you what's happening.
but the question is you have to design the experiment and you have to be the expert.
oh yeah .
so we get some crops and put a hedge.
well i mean that'll that might be worth a few marks.
mm.
erm yeah.
don't give it anything to eat.
give it just cereal and see if it eats it.
if it doesn't  i'm not touching that.
hedgehogs are obviously not eating the the wheat and the corn.
no.
should be something else.
but.
mm.
"if it does start eating the wheat, well okay."
"now we'll give it a choice of a few other things,."
mm.
and see if it eats it when he's not starving.
erm  and the earth's crust.
iron is one of the most important metals.
"so of the metals iron is very important, so is copper, because we use it a lot in circuits, erm."
is that right?
write in a write a word equation to get   is that right?
well an equation has an equals sign in it.
"oh right, yeah."
so it's one thing plus it's the in this case it's iron plus oxygen gives iron oxide.
"oh right, okay, yeah."
erm so it'll be f e plus o two will give f e two o three.
yeah.
erm or f e three o four.
there are.
mm.
two types of iron oxide.
erm so you just say the symbol.
"first of all you just think of it in words,the iron plus the oxygen gives iron oxide."
if.
okay.
"you wrote that erm well for one mark, you'd probably wouldn't get."
probably get.
anything because you want the you they want the equation.
they want the yeah.
what three things can be done to prevent it?
"erm keep it dry, keep it covered, erm."
i put it.
i wouldn't have given you the mark for covered.
definitely a mark for dry.
what do you mean by covered?
you usually say erm protected by paint or galvanized.
yeah.
but it needs to be you need to have oxygen and you need water.
keep it oxygen is another one.
make sure there's no air around that'll stop it rusting.
right.
iron ore.
right.
"iron ore, it comes up every year, erm an alloy."
right.
an alloy is when you've got two or more metals mixed together.
so.
right.
erm bronze is copper and tin.
an alloy is best when it combines the best of it's component metals.
now we don't we don't need to work with iron.
the thick frying pan is cast iron.
it's black because it's still got a lot carbon in it.
and.
right.
it's brittle.
"if you hit that hard with your hammer, it'll just break."
yeah.
"erm a steel pan, if you hit it with a hammer, it'll dent."
mm.
"so stainless steel, is an alloy of iron."
two reasons  pure iron to make car exhaust pipes.
"right, there's an easy two marks."
an easy one mark.
why is stainless steel called stainless?
have you seen stainless steel sinks?
yeah.
okay.
do they rust?
no.
so why might it be a good idea to use stainless steel for a car exhaust pipe?
because it won't rust then.
so you won't be replacing your exhaust.
well yeah.
every year cos it won't rust away if it's stainless steel.
"erm okay,right."
fancy a   what would you do to produce a movement of the ammeter needle?
turn the switch on.
size of the movement more coils put more batteries.
"what would you do to reverse the direction of the ammeter needles first movement, b?"
you wouldn't reduce the batteries to reverse it to make it go the other way.
you'll reverse the battery.
turn the battery round the other way.
"oh right, yeah."
in the circuit and then the needle will jump the other way.
yeah.
three marks here.
electric currents.
"induce currents,transformers work by induced currents, pick out appliances that use for  transformer ."
okay a  pack is one.
"erm a drill,electric toothbrush probably use a transformer because you want to lower it er an electric shaver would use a transformer."
you i think these are what would you run off a transformer.
"so reading lamp, toothbrush and three marks so we're looking for three of them."
electric.
yeah.
shaver you run off  and a toothbrush.
yeah.
"erm things you would and you wouldn't want them connected to the mains, stuck in your mouth."
yeah.
right.
"so some of them you can work out buy if you know what a transformer does, it steps down all of the current, it reduces the voltage."
mm.
"so instead of dealing with sort of high  trying to push everything  so if you bring your voltage down from two forty volts to say you could get a a transformer, a battery eliminator, for a tape recorder."
if you that runs on one and a half volts.
mm.
"three volts sorry, three volts."
"so plug two forty volts into that, just not."
mm.
transformer to bring it down to a lower voltage.
so lots of things like that it transforms.
right.
erm.
that one i that second paper she put the answers in so.
okay.
my teacher put the answers in.
erm right.
a number of materials including metals are superconductors at very low temperatures.
they've got very low conducting's the opposite of resistance so the good conductors.
you have a look at the chart.
mum seems to think i was right.
"right,what is the the critical temperature of superconductor wiring?"
"oh no, not that one."
"i've got the wrong one, sorry."
so minus a hundred and twenty  there i mean that's they're just the there's not a lot of difference really.
"oh no, that's not right."
i.
no.
wouldn't give you any marks for that .
no.
because you didn't put the minus in.
yeah.
that's why.
"there's a chart in here, hang on."
no it's in this one.
there's a chart and mum seems to there it is.
read that then and i i put forty two.
right.
"four weeks january seventy eight, windmills and electricity demand in california, four weeks of january."
so that's the electricity demand.
and that's the power   what's the highest  for jan seventy eight.
so the highest  forty two.
"erm  forty one,forty two."
it doesn't go.
right  forty forty two.
"forty two,maybe forty three but it's very close especially that they haven't given any scale."
no.
to read it.
so that's the electricity per  so that's fine.
"yeah, but i got that bit wrong."
forty two.
okay well they get they've got lots of them to mark and they marked quickly but i   looks alright to me that.
hmm.
"sorry, i just wanted your opinion  i mean  ."
mm.
i mean it might be wrong but i can't see.
okay.
you don't know much about heptane and ethanols.
oh no .
things .
right erm oh it's late to get into organic chemistry.
yeah.
so i'll.
now are these.
"yeah, her marks were."
complete complete combustion of ethanol.
erm  still haven't got any oxygen.
"that should be a plus, that's what's wrong with it."
mm.
so should have put a plus there.
"ethanol plus oxygen gives carbon dioxide, water."
right.
erm so  change that.
this is your paper isn't it?
good evening.
hello.
mary.
"she said when i came in, there's only two you."
and you know i've been sitting an hour.
"she says, there are two in front you."
now then what can we do for you this time?
well  remember you gave me tablets for this leg?
mhm.
"well, was it last ?"
"last tuesday night, my leg was awfully sore and  home at night ."
see that there?
that was  that there was a lump the size of a tennis ball.
"that and it's still, that was last tuesday night."
"it was the size of, it was a way up."
aha.
and my leg's been that sore and badly swollen i just don't.
that's the clavitis again.
oh no.
not again.
is that what it is?
ah.
"but it's just on the surface it's not, it's not the same as the other one."
it's.
aha.
that's right.
well you should have seen the size of it.
yeah.
tt they're an awful worry.
and my chest's been right sore.
"and this about half past two the day i, i was that sick, vomited and then i took the bile."
mhm.
and that just finished me.

i don't know what's wrong with me.
mm.
i just don't know what's wrong with me.
oh but you should have seen that.
"on my conscience, me."
i had a feeling that's what was you know the clavitis.
yes.
back.
oh aye.
"but, cos my knee's awfully sore."
yes.
sore.
it's bound to be.
aye.
"but that they see this, mind i told you before that this brace was awfully sore and that painful."
it's still the same.
you know?
in spite the tablets?
aye.
it's.
they're not making much difference?
it's just all sore and   i've been taking a pain here this week.

will it?
mhm.
i feel done today.
you know?
mhm.
i really feel.
yeah.
done.
"see your tagamet that's one of the side effects it, you get very occasionally with it."
it gives you tightness.
ah.
soreness in your breast.
oh gosh it's been murder.
er  i i think er i think you should give yourself a week without it to get the  a chance to get away.
without what?
tagamet.
without your tagamet.
aye.
okay then.
cos er it's only gonna gradually get worse and worse.
aye.
and worse  if you keep in with it.
i just feel done today i've never felt like this before you know?
but i just feel real  mm.
but this er leg annoyed me last week because you seen the size of the lump.
and it's not i hadn't knocked it or anything.
no.
no.
no.
no.
it just comes up itself.
aye.
and agnes'  .
mhm.
"oh and give her that ointment please, i haven't got it down and put this for the nurse."
mm.
.right.
i've given you something to get that leg sorted mary.
aye.
you take it after your food.
after my food.
two.
two a day.
after my food?
after your food.
okay.
and that'll get that scattered for you.
"it's funny it's every so, every other year this  starts."
yeah.
it was eighty six when i was sent with it.
that's right.
and then it finished up.
with lots of blood in leg so.
well let's hope it's.
i'd get pretty annoyed you know?
aye.
we'll stop it going to that.
how's mrs  doing?
is she.
oh is.
just the same?
see the hands she had?
well the nurse has been coming in every second day.
she's got them pretty well cleared up.
but oh my my.
was she scratching it right enough?
oh she was .
oh my my.
i never saw  hands like them.
and er.
"and that tablet, that ointment that's for the doctor."
the nurse.
i don't feel my  my dinner but i don't feel.
no.
when you're like that.
certainly wouldn't.
here i've given her four tubes.
okay.
of that .
right then.
thanks very much.
yes.
that's fine.
they'll.
that'll keep her going for a wee while.
keep her going.
aye.
and you look after yourself.
"i've been looking after myself and i got  together her lunch at  sits, i sit all the time."
mhm.
but i don't go back out again.
oh no.
no.
no.
till i'm gone home.
oh aye.
and sometimes if some of  folks are round they give me a lift down you know?
mm.
well that's not so bad if you're getting a wee bit of help with her but er she's a.
"oh she's  do you know she's  and she'll do as she, she'll do as she pleases ."
and  she sits and she talks and she talks and she keeps repeating the same thing again.
you know you  because she's not talking to me.
and  a wee .
i could  her.
how long will that take to go away?
never mind anything else?
three or four days mary.
aha.
you'll be back to your usual .
i'll come back if it doesn't help her .
oh you'll be back.
.
no doubt about that.
i'll still be here.
anyway thank you very much right?
i'll still be here.
right.
right mary?
cheerio.
cheerio now.
hello sir.
how you doing?
not so good.
what have you been then?
oh i think my health's breaking up.
it's my ears and er  my back.
i i was in and seeing the doctor.
mhm.
"and he's given me pills and that for it, but it's my ears ."
"this is one that's been, i've had appointment and for three times i'd had to cancel it ."
buzzing in ears when i go to bed at night.
mhm.
i'm not getting to sleep.
"it's taking me oh quite a while to get to sleep and, and i'm not hearing too good."
right.
let's have a look in and see if your brains are expanding or what's happening in here.
no wonder you're not hearing so good.
no wonder you're getting a buzzing in your ears there's a big lump of concrete in there.
is there?
let's have another look at this.
oh my.
for goodness sake.
there's a wee man with a pick and shovel in.
oh aye.
it's solid.
is it?
absolutely solid.
i've been putting drops in it too.
aye.
quite regular.
aye.
"i'll, i'll need to give you some special stuff to loosen that."
aye.
because that's.
because it's.
right?
it's caught in the hairs.
mhm.
in the inside here and if we try and syringe it out it'll pull hairs out.
aha.
and irritate the skin.
aye.
i'll give you some special stuff to get rid of that.
cos i've been trying and trying for ages.
to get that.
no.
"it's the, it's absolutely solid."
"the, the drops are not  not doing anything."
seeing doctor  the other week.
my back absolutely killing me.
and i'm falling asleep every time i sit down.
we'll need to do something about that.
that's not right.
between that and my back and my knees it's.
.
two drops of this.
aha.
in the morning.
a wee bit of cotton wool just on the outside.
same on the other side.
same at bedtime before you got to bed.
aha.
couple drops and.
mhm.
cotton wool.
and that'll.
gradually loosen that up.
come back down in about a fortnight.
aha.
and we'll just a wee gentle syringe and it'll all come away.
smashing.
no problem at.
right.
all.
now then.
thirty two.
grove.
grove   .
now is your insurance line due in about a fortnight ?
aye.
aye.
right.
here we are then  and they'll have to get that sorted for .
great.
thanks.
okay.
right.
cheerio now.
cheerio.
i've come of a new.
please.
let's have a look.
this is the noraday yeah .
noraday yeah.
everything okay on that?
"yeah, fine yeah ."
periods behaving?
"erm sometimes i have a a good period, like."
yeah.
i used to on er.
yeah.
other pill.
yeah that's right.
but sometimes i don't have one or.
yeah.
sometimes it's just one.
yeah.
day.
"yeah, erratic ?"
er yeah.
but.
"right, okay."
no problem .
"yes , that can happen on noraday waterworks?"
bowels?
breasts?
yeah fine.
all behaving?
yes.
"right, now what we do need to do today is to get your blood pressure checked."
yeah.
how are things going on from the other point of view?
erm it get's.
mm.
off still .
yes.
yeah.
we we still haven't heard anything.
from the psychologist?
"er no,go to see him ."
"you've you've got from them, certainly."
yeah.
yeah.
but you're still in limbo as far as the.
yeah.
the civil action is concerned?
"erm even no second inquest, nothing ."
oh.
but er apparently  got a solicitor.
er we haven't had to see anybody about that and he sent us a letter saying that he'd like to see us and we went and he says it there might not be a second inquest.
oh.
might go straight to court.
ah.
"and then we had a phone call from the police, about a month ago."
"oh right, good."
"saying that it had gone straight to court, it was in court, you know,."
oh right.
but we haven't heard anything.
oh well i mean they may have been adjourned or a.
.
it may have been referred to a higher court.
you think so.
erm.
"i mean we we haven't heard anything directly, i'm only glad that the police are actually telling you something."
yeah yeah.
"it it was a big shock that day, when we had that phone call."
mm.
"but it was you know, to know that you haven't got to fight,."
"that's right, yeah ."
to take him to court.
erm.
but it's a long process.
"i mean we have dealings with solicitors for all sorts of things, asking for reports and we send a lot of notes away to have a lot of er  medical opinion reports and they take ages to come back."
"and that's a these are the preliminary things that the solicitor must go through before they get near court, so."
yeah.
the people.
yeah.
who it's actually they're actually dealing with are waiting months and months and months and er.
yeah.
it looks like that in your case.
we.
"we may well have to provide the medical report on your behalf, yet."
god.
but no-one has approached me to do so.
no no.
so er but it wouldn't surprise me if some sort of medical report on how you are doesn't reach court.
"it erm mr  who we see psychologist erm the first week i went to see him, oh ."
"it certainly, you know erm."
yeah.
it's very.
erm.
hard.
"we do you know when we start doing something, we'll do it and we do things different  gonna say?"
we thinking well why are we doing it this way ?
mm.
"so er everything's pulling at us,."
yeah.
you know.
"we seem we do something and we  we are absolutely drained ,."
mm.
you get we want to push ourselves.
that's right.
"but do you know, once we start doing something we're just drained all the while."
in some ways you're in limbo cos you've you've got nothing to aim towards.
you've.
no.
"got i mean if you had a date to aim towards, it was six months hence, that would help you, you could."
yeah.
aim towards it and work towards it.
yeah.
but er and i think it's most unfair on you two really and the whole thing.
"and you you come off worse than anyone else and er but there's no real way of speeding that up, they can't give."
no.
"dates and they can't say what's going to happens  they have to go through, sift the evidence, arrange it all in a certain order,."
and then go and.
"rachael, she's coming home well she was she was discharged friday from hospital ."
mm.
oh right.
"and er they thought thursday they'd have to do an operation on her by taking a piece of bone from her hip,."
mhm.
and putting it in the leg.
but they said it was knitting together lovely.
good good.
"but then they took the pins out,."
ah.
"let her go home friday, discharged her the day after."
"she'd put too much weight on it, and she's back in hospital, she's broke it."
"well they'll probably have to put the bone in there, it's a bone graft."
they've put it in plaster at the moment .
"yeah,."
"but you know she she's mending, it's erm."
"she she's coming okay, i think."
mm.
"you know to see her , that's you know."
mm.
but we don't go as often now.
no.
"erm,."
right.
"lovely, and."
the six packets of noraday.
"yeah, yeah."
your smear is due in december.
now i'm going to leave that with you.
"if you really don't feel like coming up for a smear at that time, that's fine and we'll understand why."
and there's an awful lot.
yeah.
"of pressure on you from an awful lot of other sources, so don't worry about it."
and.
yeah.
but er you are.
actually officially due in december and obviously we'd like.
is that me three years?
yeah.
yeah.
we'd like.
yeah.
to get that done.
yeah.
don't seem like three years.
"oh, no i'm sure."
the psychologist will continue to see you.
and if.
yeah.
"you want to pop in and have a chat with me that's fine, but i'm not here next week."
"yeah, yeah."
so that's that.
er and i hope everything goes a smoothly as possible.
"if there are any medical reports to do, we'll get them done as soon as possible but you know,that's very much our hands, and."
yeah.
"we can only wait on your solicitors, their solicitors, there's the police, the court, the entire system."
"you see we haven't notified any solicitor , it was."
no.
just when we got back off holiday we'd got a letter from.
well it's if the police are doing the prosecuting then you may.
yeah.
not have to bother.
"well it it apparently there is a clause in lee's insurance er that got the solicitor,."
yeah.
and he notified us.
right.
and he said he would represent.
"but then he mentioned, when we wen to see him, he says  we will deal with this but you must get somebody for civil."
yeah.
action.
yeah.
and we asked him if he did civil action .
"oh right , yeah."
and he said yes he'd.
mm.
he would you know he hasn't the records haven't got to be released then to.
no.
anybody else.
he he will be able to get them.
"but it's just hoping that everything goes right, but we."
haven't got to fight for prosecution.
no no.
"that should go through, but er it's a question of when it's going to be though."
"yeah, yeah."
do they usually take time like this?
yes.
yeah.
yes.
"things from er data whenever can take ages and ages and ages to and you know doctors get sued every now and again, perish the thought,."
oh.
perish the thought but when.
"you when you keep hearing reports in the medical journals about doctors being sued, and it can be several years after the event that the case comes to court."
"now it won't be that long in your case, but it just goes to show how lengthy the whole thing can be ."
yea yeah yeah.
and it's er.
but it's so.
but.
"much hurt, you know ."
that's right.
"but pete he he still getting up very early, he doesn't sleep."
mm.
very good .
yeah.
yeah.
i mean in some ways.
and.
i think he's more effected by it than you.
and.
i like erm psychologist said erm.
there's a lot of anger there isn't there?
yeah.
"he says i'm still with denial,."
yeah.
and pete knows it's happened.
mm.
"i erm if i try not to give way, it leaves so much up here."
mm.
i can keep thinking it's not happened.
yeah.
that's right.
but.
you know.
but.
"working through it all, it's very very painful."
yeah.
and it's easier in the short term not to have  in the long term you get more problems.
yea yeah.
i i've found that.
"you know, like i say, i try to do some things different, and then that don't work sometimes cos i think well why am i doing 'em like that."
mm.
i wouldn't be doing this if it hadn't happened.
do you do you.
mhm.
do you now what i mean?
so like you say it can cause.
that few more problems.
but erm probably if we wasn't  so much and.
mm.
i think he 'd be.
i think sometimes he's still being protective.
yeah.
he's still being protective .
mm.
that's right.
and erm dunno.
"the police i know, went to see rachael, and they still can't understand why he didn't use an islander, you know?"
no.
and it's just unbelievable.
mm.
but everybody's allowed a mistake but.
"when you've got a big articulated lorry ,."
bit of drastic mistake to make.
you know if you you know i can't stop feeling that morning he used that lorry as a weapon.
mm.
you know.
"er i don't  i think as it goes on you do start and get that anger that anger so bad, but erm but i'll leave you to get on doctor."
and.
started with this device  this is the thing i made it at the grammar school when i was working there.
"it's like a a wooden box with a glass lid and inside looks like perspex, is that right, perspex  wheels."
"yeah, that's right."
switches inside .
"there's a a motor been on here, it was  ring the school bells."
that's like a a sort of electrically driven timer.
"yes, that's what it is, and in the grammar school they had biology wanted to have plants growing in the dark but provide a light for them."
"one plant had to get light for eight hours per day and the other one had to get light for sixteen hours a day, so  another wheel at this end did this job when this went around so many times."
aha.
ah so that controlled the lights to your plants then.
yes.
i see you've made several versions of.
"yes, that's right."
this one had a whole lot of switches on so it can be altered from outside without going inside.
that was  what looks like a satellite dish what on earth is this?
it's a very.
"yeah it looks like a satellite dish, it's only a yard in diameter."
the focus of this is about fourteen inches from the centre and if you put a microphone here when this this thing is outside it's ideal for picking up bird song.
you can pick up birds from  a mile away.
we'll have to have to get a few of these in radio orkney i can see.
yes it's quite good for long distance.
"it's ideal for birds with the high frequency voice, but for people they the speech is lower in frequency and doesn't work quite so well."
so you can't use it for eaves dropping.
no.
did you make this thing?
"i had a satellite mirror found in a quarry, and took used this it was a mould for this to get it a perfect parabolic shape."
and it's made of fibre glass is it ?
fibre glass.
yes i see.
"and er underneath it here we have a a glass box, i see."
there's a mirror inside there.
frosted glass screen on it.
yes.
so when i take this out and pout this through the window it shines straight up and you can look at the clouds and you can tell which direction the wind is.
ah i see.
ah right so the the direction the clouds are moving in against this frosted glass screen.
yes.
you can use as a.
just see them you can't see it today when there's just one cloud.
ah yes it's continuous.
a continuous cloud.
and you can tell by the speed they're travelling what speed the wind is.
aha.
"i see , so that measures the speed of them across the screen this way you can time it ."
"yes,i had a seconds timer there as you can see."
so the the pendulum you've got set up here you can use as a a timer against.
yes.
that.
it's a simple timer.
yeah.
well simple minds can simple things.
i never had any education since i was fourteen so i used the very simplest things when i find the very simple things can do very complicated jobs.
yes.
"so on the bench here we have a a device on a a tripod, again, it has wheels on it where marked off in what looks like degrees."
am i right ?
that's that's degrees yes.
aha.
"two wheels, one on top the other and a what looks like an eyepiece to look to look through."
what what's that for sandy?
"yes, well, it's at at an odd angle, you noticed that  because we are in latitude fifty nine, so the centre of this has to look at the pole star."
"it's an astronomical device then, yes  i see ."
"and er this has to be thirty one degrees to the level, er you follow the stars as they travel around the sky, because they're always highest in the south and like the sun and the moon they're always highest when they're due south."
"so this is the same idea and if there's a star something that i did see a wee while ago, i saw a a light very close down to the horizon and i said i've never seen a star so bright way down there."
"so i looked through this device and er found what the reading it gave, so i went to my map and i found that that's where mars should have been."
so i assumed that this was mars.
when i got my telescope to look through it was gone.
"so it was on  look for it later, so i traced it up and it was mars."
so you can use to identify stars.
stars.
just from their position in the sky.
and er the sun doesn't always travel at the same speed it goes fast and slow so  we can also measure the  the sun.
"i see, so you take that top wheel off and you have another one underneath where alternative reading."
and that's and that's in hours.
", yes i see."
and er the sun can be as much as nearly twenty minutes slow or fast.
so you can adjust for the the differences there.
the sun is only at the correct time four times in one year.
the earth doesn't take a circular path around the sun so it passes it quickly sometimes and slowly at other times.
it makes the sun appear to vary in its time keeping.
so you've built this machine to incorporate that error so you can compensate for that.
oh i see .
"i canna look through the sun at it, but i see the the the shadow of the one on on the other."
"ah yes,."
"eyepiece , it's painted white so it gives a shadow."
and it also tells me how high it is in the sky.
so it's like a sextant almost in a way.
"oh well  aye , i suppose."
it's an interesting machine.
this is the same idea .
oh yes.
"and the camera goes on there and a wee electric motor over yonder, which drives it around at fifteen degrees per hour, which makes it follow the stars as they move around the sky."
"oh, so it's so it's for photographing the star and."
yes.
well it's a time exposure.
"if you take a time exposure of the stars with a static camera you just get streaks, the earth's movement, and i should make the device follow the stars at the correct speed, you can get an awful lot of stars that's completely invisible to the naked eye."
it picks up the very dim stars.
so this this allows you to follow them along while the camera's shutter's open.
"yes, that's right."
you can take an hour's exposure with this one.
i've never done any fifteen minutes.
have you got any photographs that you've taken by this means?
yes i have indeed.
"i took my early ones in black and white, but the later ones i took in colour and er i saw to one side of orion what looked like the plough."
you can see the stars there are quite bright.
i've looked with binoculars and i can't see them with the naked eye.
these are so faint and they only show up the long time exposure.
"i see, so so a way of seeing stars that you otherwise would not be able to see ."
you can't see.
here's the the belt of orion and the sword.
you can see the centre one is red.
tremendous.
is this just an ordinary camera you've used?
just an ordinary camera.
thirty five millimetres?
yes thirty five millimetre.
"ha, gee you wouldn't have believed that was possible."
and this is the the picture of the moon.
how big the moon appeared with this.
"it fills the frame, yes."
"but er the only problem here is we're too low down and there's too much shimmer in the atmosphere, difficult to get anything really clear."
"i see, presumably this is why all the big observatories are near the equator, is that right ?"
"yes well , they get mountains if possible to get rid of the shimmer."
the moving hot and cold air.
now i'd i notice there's a an enormous telescope behind us here .
what size of telescope is this ?
"er it's er it's a ex w d lens, after wartime they sold these things they sold them in catalogues and i sent of for this one, and it's about a stone and a half in weight."
and er.
that's a size.
the glass is six inches in diameter and is a thirty six inch focus.
i have another eyepiece on the end which is suitable for looking at the stars and planets.
it's also a piece of ex w d equipment and gives a right-angled viewing and turns the picture right side up.
most astronomical telescopes view everything upside-down and er i drew two hundred lines to the inch inside this eyepiece.
the lines are so close together that two of them can be seen crossing the planet jupiter at any one time.
the lines are about eight point eight inches apart at a distance of one mile.
i notice we have a chart on the back of the door here a circle measured off in angles and er this is lovely it's got venus.
yes.
well.
"earth, mars and then it's measured off in."
"saturn , saturn is as far as we can see."
"this is  already erect now to find the the planets and stars when you're using the telescope, yeah ."
yes well they would.
"well brings us very very conveniently to your your first choice of piece of music sandy, too is this."
yes.
part of the planets suite by holst.
yes.
astronomy god then sandy?
oh well it must be my before i was a teenager.
and i very young days.
"living on the farm we were quite isolated, we had no street lights outside, there were no lights very many lights anywhere at that time."
and we had very clear skies and showed up the the stars quite brilliantly.
"i found a lens in an old box and i used, i got another two lenses, and i fitted them together in an a tube, i had no tubing but there was an old bicycle at the house and i cut up the frame and put one lens at the one end of the frame and the seat pillar, i used the seat pillar for focusing."
"and my pictures were but i could see the rings of saturn with it, which was more than what galileo saw first when he looked, he thought there was two stars at either side of saturn."
if he'd had a bike he would have er done better then.
"we found then that the bigger the objective lens was the more light could be got and the bigger you could make it, so as i got bigger and got er the chance of making my own lenses and building up lenses of various kinds, i found that i could get quite a good magnification."
how do you actually make a lens?
i got a porthole from the fulforn when it was being sent off for being scrapped.
and it was about ten inches in diameter.
"and i had to get another lens, a piece of glass about the same size, to grind it, because you grind the glass with another piece of glass with a grit ."
grit and water.
carborundum powder and water.
"and you rub backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards, and i ground like this for several hours every night, after i came home, for three months."
that's a long project.
and that took the centre of the glass down by maybe a a one and a half millimetres.
that was all of the glass that was worn away in that time.
"but er it did not do bad, got a fair good picture with it."
now we've got some interesting photos here now in this this album of people standing beside themselves  i would say .
"ah twins, yes."
how did you how did you achieve this?
"well er i had a lot of friends here and there, and when i've had a lot of photos to develop for them, and then when i got everything done, you felt a sigh of relief at getting it all done."
so you tried then to do something to use up the rest of the developer.
and there's one here with a a group of people and i found that a stone wall makes an ideal thing to trick photography with.
because you can join it anywhere and it doesn't look messy.
ah yes.
i er see the the way the the two parts of the photograph are joined on the.
i.
the stone wall.
"i turned out the the negative to do the other half, which makes 'em look keeps the  the group equally."
"yeah, it looks like a large family group."
four sets of twins.
and over the page here we've got got some more.
the borry jungle this this photograph's called .
yes.
"this was a a real life picture with great big trees and a real forest and it was done by it was a footpath through ferns, and the."
i see.
ferns are only about two feet high.
"or rather less, but the jungle track through the centre helps to show you it's a a roadway, though it's only about a a foot wide."
so the camera was right down on the bottom.
"now there are a few branches there, there's one that's lying kind of horizontal, it'll be an idea to set someone that."
"so we have this in the next picture, and it was another one vertical, we got one to grab a hold of it."
mm.
lean on it.
yes er it looks either like tiny folk or enormous ferns.
yes.
this is done in two exposures presumably?
yes.
that was done a different way from the other pictures.
"you actually take the peoples' photographs first, cut them out and plant them on the original."
rephotograph it.
this got me into some problems too  with a chap in braigh who was very fond of black polled cattle.
"knew a fellow somewhere in evy that wouldn't be seen dead holding a black polled cattle, so er he er came along to me with er farmer's weekly, and a black polled cow on it, and gave me a photograph of this man."
so  he wanted it me to make this man hold this cow.
"anyway i had to photograph the man, i photographed the cow and i had to photograph a background."
and i had to merge all these pictures together.
"it looks very convincing i must say, it just looks like a farmer."
the.
holding the the the halter or.
feet of the cow was not in the original photograph so i had to go a a farm and ask for straw to hide the.
the the animal's feet.
you went away with a photograph to show us.
"yes, and i never heard of this  and there's another lady that brought me a picture with four generations in."
"but a fifth person appeared in the reflection of a window, can i remove them?"
"so i had a shot at this, but if i cut it out that part of the window was black, it didn't look right, so i put a shade over it."
"now it was a fairly white, it still."
aha.
didn't look right.
"so oh i say, i'll cut it out and make a wee hole and transport part of the wood work across the window."
"the window was completely boarded up, it took me a while to do that."
the next thing i got was an order for twenty of them.
i.
whole thing twenty times over.
"well, what's your second choice of music then sandy?"
well er.
this is a photograph of you as a a young fellow walking the high wire.
"yes,that's right."
oh where did you get this high wire to walk across?
"well this one here is a water pipe, it's er what?"
an inch and quarter or something in diameter.
"i found it in hoy, and there's some deep gullies there."
"there's ditches where er the water has run away all the boulder clay and left maybe a ditch, this one was nine feet deep."
"and i put balanced it out across this, and i set my camera down er down below, on a time exposure which runs off in about one minute, so i had one minute to run up the side of the thing and get out here and balance myself."
"i had another l pipe, piece of water pipe, which i used as a balancing device, but i found, with the watering pipe you are so stable you feel it's a shame to be seen holding on."
i say you don't look very stable.
"to me up there, i must admit sandy?"
aha.
"so you took the photograph yourself, ?"
more or less aye.
there's er this other one here with a i carried a fish box out onto the wire and set it down and sat on it.
i had no balancing pole then.
i can see that.
that looks like a bit of a balancing feat right enough.
what led you to try this?
i don't know.
it's just something i just felt like doing and i couldn't have any real reason for doing it.
well i don't think there's any better reason than that.
on this page we have the the churchill barrier.
this is er early stage of construction.
barriers were getting closed up and above water we were permitted to walk across.
"so i was still in berry then and working at the grammar school, so we had to walk across all three causeways for some time."
"there was  at near the end or the middle, number two causeway and i was crossing there one day, and the tide was out and er the big ship that was along the causeway was very close to the to the stones."
and i saw a hole in the bottom at the side of it where they had blasted a hole in it to sink it.
so i says i'll pop down and go inside to see what like it is.
"i had my camera with me and i saw there was a ladder up on the top deck and when i got up on the top deck it was quite a giddy height, not to be bit i looked at the mast then i climbed up the mast  up three quarters of the way up the mast and er the view from up there looked right down on the causeway."
"oh, i see."
i thought that was an aerial photograph some height up there.
we photographers go to daft places to get photos.
"at times, it was leonard's top seller for about fifteen years."
it's in books a few books have it in it.
"well sandy, we've only looked at a few of the things in your shed and a very few of your photographs but it's been fascinating."
thank you very much for your time.
what's your third choice of piece of music then sandy?
well i'm not awfully good at music but my wife is very keen on music.
what about the the churchill barriers?
very appropriate i think very appropriate .
yes i think that might be my .
i've got your form here somewhere.
right.
"and erm  i, it tells me what you wanted to talk about."
yes.
erm  oh that's right.
you're third year english aren't you?
"yeah, that's right."
yeah.
okay.
and er oh you er it's social work you're interested in is it?
yes.
yes.
erm  okay.
yeah .
can i get on a postgrad two year course next year ?
mm.
you mean to apply now for autumn?
yes.
i think that's very optimistic really.
"well, and what experience have you got?"
not very much.
"i mean i, i, i took er a gap year out in birmingham working for a church."
oh i see.
er.
and what did you actually do?
well it was called a discipleship training course erm.
yes.
so a lot of it was teaching.
erm but the relevant.
yeah.
bits to this would be erm i ran er a youth group in ladywood which was er central birmingham.
oh yes.
and er we did a couple of weeks erm teaching in schools and we helped run a erm a lunching club for old people.
oh yes.
"but the, the, probably the relevant thing would be the youth, the youth work."
erm.
yes.
what did you do on the youth work side?
well we  it was run from a local church but erm.
mm.
"the  the fairly elderly couple which, who started."
mm.
the work up erm.
mm.
he was ill or something or going away and erm er the church we were working for was invited to take it over.
"oh i see, yes."
"and er so we were the kind of  erm the team who were there the, at the time so."
and.
a couple of us took it on.
"did you play table tennis with them, or what  did you do ?"
well that i mean that to get them in yeah that's the sort of thing we started with erm playing pool and er table tennis and that.
mm.
erm.
mm.
and then we went more interactive things.
we had  i mean you couldn't do that much but it was.
no.
"you know a ten, fifteen minute discussion and stuff like that."
on  what sort of topics?
on on religious topics mostly.
"oh i see, yes."
i mean we did you know stuff like erm er  what's the one i did?
"are, are christians boring."
erm.
you know  sort of thing like that.
i see .
"so, so you weren't really doing anything on  their sort of personal development or their social  problems or, you know, could they get jobs or could they get work or what were the pressures on them, how."
no.
how did they  cope with their relationships or anything like that?
no.
i mean we did er.
no.
we talked informally about erm their.
oh.
relationships and things like that cos that was.
"oh right, yeah."
the sort of thing that cropped up.
yeah.
"i mean there was nothing on a, on a formal level or anything."
no.
like that  welfare.
no.
or jobs or anything like that.
no.
"so i mean it doesn't, i mean, i mean the point about social work erm  you know doing  er some experience is i think you actually experience the erm  sort of the, the group dynamics of people who are in trouble and can't cope."
mm.
"and i, that's why i was wondering  er how much you did on that front really ."
"yeah, i mean that  the youth  and i've done some at home as well erm."
yeah.
the only other relevant.
not much.
thing would be.
yeah.
erm  er holiday  schools work.
oh yes?
yeah.
which i've done since i was sixteen.
mm.
erm  but that was just group leader stuff really.
erm but  no i i need erm to get on a voluntary placement next year probably.
i think you probably.
but.
"do, yeah."
yeah.
but erm i don't know what sort of thing would get me the best experience .
well the one thing you could do is go and talk to  one or two admissions tutors of the social work  courses.
i mean there is one here .
"right, yeah."
and you could go over to  erm the social work department in  and try and you know get an interview with the admissions person.
mm.
"erm and  say you know, what sort of  idea, you know, what would you think would be good experience?"
"i mean i think it might be good if before you did that you could try and explore a bit on your own and, and have some idea but i mean."
"yeah, sure."
"in a sense, when you've done that, er it's a good thing to check it out."
mm.
erm.
"well i've, i've got a couple of applications on the go."
"i mean i've got  erm seven, well ."
but  there's one.
yeah.
er  erm it was in the church of england newspaper of erm.
mm.
mm.
"er there's a place in dover which, which'll be a residential thing for a year."
ah.
erm.
"that sounds  what, what sort of  er people have they got there?"
"that's, that's erm  adults with erm learning disabilities."
"oh i see, yes."
"erm or there's, there'll be  the other one er."
mm.
i've got contacts with is.
mm.
shad erm working in london with erm a placement with someone with a disability working.
oh yes?
forty eight hours on with them and then forty eight hours off.
oh i see.
and that's.
now what's shad?
that's single.
erm  i can't remember what.
no.
the exact acronym is.
no.
what sort of people are there?
i mean er.
erm well there're all sorts of er range groups but.
yeah.
erm it's mostly physically handicapped people.
oh i see.
yes.
erm.
well it might be good.
"erm  er is er now does that have a religious basis, shad, or."
"shad doesn't, no."
no.
"erm the one in dover does,."
"does, yes."
but it's not  erm.
"er it was, it's welfare based."
"yes, i see."
"i mean i, i don't know how you feel about it but it might be a good thing  to do something that was not religious based, erm."
"yes , definitely."
"you know, just to get in with er a different sort of group of people with different sort of motivations ,."
yeah.
erm to show you know you have the broader erm experience.
"i mean have you looked at our alternative opportunities section out there, or."
erm.
that's the yellow files.
that's the yellow files.
yeah.
yeah i did i did go through it.
yeah.
i've taken a.
yeah.
erm a couple.
yeah.
of addresses down.
yeah.
"but there there wasn't, mm, well there was nothing that seemed immediately er relevant i must say, but."
no.
i mean you've not looked at er a lot of the mental health stuff?
"i mean er people like the richmond fellowship, or  did you, you didn't find them?"
no.
"maybe you don't actually, don't want to do mental."
i don't.
"health, or."
"well, i don't know."
erm but.
mm.
"i'm not really sure what, what i'm looking for."
no.
"what, do you have any idea what sort of social work  you would want to do in the end, or not really?"
"erm  well, i had a look at probation which is a a different."
oh yes?
"but similar avenue i suppose,."
yeah.
mm.
mm.
"erm but there, there are elements of that which come into social work, i would have thought."
mm.
erm  er young work with young offenders or something like that.
erm.
yes.
yes.
i mean there are broad categories you see in a sense.
i mean certainly the social services now divide up .
"i mean  er you know the, the, the erm  training is supposed to be a generic training you learn the various erm ways of coping with clients you know, and it."
mm.
"doesn't matter whether they're ninety five or  you know sixteen, there are."
yeah.
"certain sort of listening skills and er erm the, the idea that you, you've got to get erm people to look at the things maybe they don't want to look at."
mm.
"but in a positive way, and those sorts of things will obviously apply whatever group you're dealing with."
but on the other hand i think the erm social work is now going  back again to a situation where it's really rather more specialized.
mm.
"certainly i know, somebody i know who works with north yorkshire, they seem to have divided up into the  old and the young."
yeah.
"erm so you've either got you know the, the, the sort of  or the old people, or you've got the young people, and that reaches back down the age range into things like child abuse which is now, you know, very er much er on the agenda."
"erm  so i mean i think, you know, it might be useful, well, in some ways it would be very useful for you to have erm two sort of six month stints in rather different environments then you'd keep your options open ."
mm.
"erm if you were interested in probation then maybe you could get work in a probation hostel  er you know as, as some sort of er assistant."
unqualified helper or something.
right.
"erm which would give you some contact with erm, er you know people who'd er  er just come prison or, or you know had been serving some sort of sentence or other, you know, maybe not a custodial one or something."
erm  but that might be interesting.
"i mean i'm sure if you asked erm  you know the probation service  people in york, i'm sure they could, well i mean if you're thinking about probation, you probably ought to go in and look, unless you've already."
"yeah, sure."
"done so, i mean and as part of that you could  ask questions about whether, you know there might be some longer-term  placement you could do or something."
right.
erm  so i mean that might be  worth it.
"would you do this erm  i suppose if you, well i don't know, it depends whether it's residential or not."
you you'd be  erm quite happy to do residential.
yes.
would you?
mm.
i think that's good because i think most of it probably is residential.
mm.
erm and you get  erm you know a rather more intense  sort of experience i think if you do that.
mm.
erm i mean it's not what everybody wants but erm i think it is quite er interesting.
"i mean the, the richmond fellowship things are quite interesting."
"they've got mind you they have their own training sort of regime , which in some ways is, means it's quite good experience because it is  structured in, in a, in a  way to give you some training, whereas if you just go in to do a job then erm how much  sort of training you get varies ."
"i mean one would hope you got some wherever you  went  you know,."
"mm, sure."
er but sometimes you don't get very much.
"erm and if there is erm  a sort of definite regime then that, that may be quite good."
"i mean it depends  er whether you're in a  fearful hurry to start the training  you know,and get."
erm.
qualified.
i mean erm.
"no i don't think, no i'm not in a fearful hurry."
"it's just  i've, i've done three years at university now and i, i."
yes .
"and it's, it's a subject which i've enjoyed doing a lot, english,."
right.
yeah.
"erm but it's, it's had you know no vocational direction whatsoever,."
right.
yeah.
"and erm  er now er now i want to  i don't mind training again but it, it's got to be vocational."
right.
yes.
"and so  erm  the, the experience in the work experience i get now i want to be with a, a definite view to get to, get in training."
right.
yes.
to get.
yes.
a job.
yes i see.
"yes, what i really meant was i'm, i  forget exactly but we could look it up in  you know the richmond fellowship file out there,."
mm.
and they've got quite a big place at harrogate where you could go for a day or two to observe what was going on .
"now i think, if i remember rightly, they had a sort of two year  sort of training pattern,."
right.
"which you do, and then you're er you know in their eyes you're, you're trained to some sort of level for their sort of work."
"now that's not the same thing as the  the erm  study year you know, the."
mm.
"social work qualification but, erm, on the other hand  you know it's a structured sort of and therefore you get, you know, there'd be reviews and all this sort of thing, and therefore you'd get something it."
erm it's just that er and i don't suppose you need to stay two years if you don't want to.
i mean if it was working  well then maybe you'd stay an extra year and  finish it off but.
mm.
"erm if, if you know you, you felt you wanted to go off and do start the professional social work training well that would probably be alright."
"erm i think too the thing about probation to go back to that,."
mm.
is that you have to be accepted by the home office the erm you know particular institution running the course.
i i don't mean that's er er a terribly difficult thing but it is just that that does have to happen.
right.
er that.
erm .
what sort of thing are you talking about?
about past criminal offences and stuff?
oh no.
"no i think it's, well i mean yes presumably."
i mean i.
well.
don't think they like.
"well i haven't got, well i got stopped."
no no.
for not having my lights.
yes.
on my bike once but er.
well  no i don't i don't think that's too serious .
"no it, it wasn't really that,it was erm although i'm sure they do  check that."
mm.
"but, well i think they check that sort of thing for social workers don't they?"
"yeah they do, yeah i read that yeah."
"cos they  have to be very careful, especially with this abuse."
mm.
"business you see that, er anyway, erm  no, i think it's more that the home office want to be satisfied that you're the sort of person who will make a good probation officer."
right.
erm pardon?
right.
"er yeah, yeah."
"i mean er they don't  i, i think it's more like an interview you know  er really, where they they will be trying to assess your suitability the actual institution that's going to give you the course."
right.
"so you've got two of these sort of sessions er er to go through, that's really the only point."
right.
"erm and  i mean i'm not too sure, you'd probably need to ask the probation people, what specific things they were looking for, but i suppose the probation service, i mean you are an officer of the court,."
mm.
erm which means there is a sort of er disciplinary er sort of element in it.
"i mean i suppose there is in all social work in a sense, that if you go in to look at a family and, and you're trying to assess  you know whether the children should be taken into care, well you're exercising a  a sort of statutory erm  er sort of responsibility, and as far as the clients are concerned, er if you, like that can get in the way of er  er a more human sort of relationship if you see what i mean, because."
mm.
"you know, in the one case you're, you're the representative of court the probation  erm officer and they know that if they break the probation or you erm do a bad report on them, maybe they've got a suspended or something and they'll, so you know there's a, and, and you somehow have to handle that."
mm.
"it doesn't alienate the person  and, and, and they regard you as a, you know and that's actually probably quite tricky, except that you can't just let them off, because you  are actually  an officer of the court."
mm.
you see what i mean?
and er probably they'd be interested to know how you would handle that.
right.
"erm and er the, i suspect, i mean there are probably as many answers to that as there are  probation officers ."
"er but it's a particular problem for probation, you know?"
mm.
"erm  and the, the social work thing has also something of that."
"you know, if the erm  that if the family think you're going to actually take the child off them because they're not looking after it properly, then i mean obviously they're not perhaps going to be as frank with you as they might otherwise."
mm.
and you know that may hamper you in really reaching a decision about  erm  the real nature of the relationship they've got with the child.
so you know there are some quite interesting  sort of angles.
mm.
erm  mm.
"but basically i think most courses now, not sure there's actually a legal requirement, i don't think it is, but most of them want a year's sort of full time  experience in erm, you know,dealing with underprivileged people really and their problems and people who can't cope for one reason or another, and how  er you can er er help them and what sort of relationship you can build with them , and how."
mm.
you feel about it and all that.
"and then you can talk about all that in the interview, about your motivation why you want to do the  job you see?"
mm.
"and, and probably you pick up some of the language used to describe this, you know."
yeah.
but erm.
mm.
er york apparently ask for two years' experience in.
do they?
the postgrad course.
oh do they?
yeah well you could go and talk to them and see what they  what they thought you ought to be doing in that two years.
mm.
"i mean erm  well i don't know, would you want to stay here, or er."
erm  i don't know.
i mean is it  i shouldn't think so.
"if i, if i was two."
mm.
years  erm.
yeah.
training.
two years' placement or something.
yeah.
"i mean i've, i've very."
mm.
much enjoyed my three years here but.
"yeah,."
i think it would be nice to go somewhere new.
mm.
mm.
mm.
erm.
i think one of the things is to try and use the placement to check out for yourself erm perhaps what sort of group you want to be working with in.
mm.
"in general terms, you know."
"i mean one of the problems with probation i think to a certain extent is that  er obviously if you get these people who keep going into prison and coming out again, er it's really pretty difficult to erm  er  influence their behaviour positively probably."
mm.
"and that can be depressing, i think."
"erm  whereas you know maybe with the younger people you feel, well there's  you know more, more chance."
erm.
i think you feel that you've put in more a more positive input .
yes.
"what if well that's right, yes."
yes you know there is a chance still to er get them on a  er a route which will give them a sort of positive  er relationship to society maybe a negative one.
mm.
"but on the other hand you've often got to deal with not just them, but their parents or, or people around them or the people they relate to and."
mm.
"you know er so even, even that can be  quite difficult, but on the other hand  you know there's probably more, more chance of  creating something positive."
mm.
but i mean it depends.
i mean some people actually  erm  depends what you think of as positive.
"i mean i, you know some people actually  erm  quite like looking after the older people, where."
mm.
"really i mean what you're almost presiding over is a sort of steady decline, really, but on the other hand i think some people think if you can make that as erm as sort of dignified as you can and actually give them  support when they actually need it,."
mm.
"then erm that's actually quite a worthwhile, you know some people get quite a lot of satisfaction from doing that."
yeah.
"so it's a very personal  sort of thing really, you know which area you  want to go into."
"and i suppose  it's not necessarily always the one that you've had experience in so far, you know."
yeah.
that's true.
"but i mean the, the."
mm.
"i suppose  the, the sort of things that made me think i might be suitable for social work have been coming from working  with the young."
"right, yes."
yes.
erm but you see i haven't  i don't know.
"i suppose in interview, especially with er a c v like mine, that i might come over as quite  erm  naive."
yes.
"and i, i i've had a privileged background."
you know even.
mm.
"the very fact that i'm sitting at university,."
yes .
would denote that.
"erm  but i  i want to  and i'm not sure where to go from here, i'm not sure."
no.
where to get the contact that i would need.
erm.
"well it may, it may be that."
"you, you will  it'll be a sort of growing thing, you know?"
mm.
"whatever you start with, that'll, that'll give you another  erm  er sort of experience."
"i mean i think that's why in way it, it would be good to go outside the religious context, because then you'll come up er you er you know you'll meet people who have a er a rather different motivation."
yeah.
"to your own, but you'll be, you'll understand it, you know, and you'll, you'll  erm er get to understand what, what their motivation is, which."
mm.
i think'll be very important because.
mm.
probably er the majority of your colleagues are not going to be religious.
yeah.
"i mean unless you actually do go and work for a specifically religious  charity,."
mm.
"which you, you might be able to do."
mm.
"but erm that would er  you know limit you er very much, and you did, er you would almost certainly be, be erm  having to relate to other professionals in, in, in the er area who, who were not  religious, so it would be a very good thing to."
mm.
"do that i think and, and see another  side."
and i mean in that way you might really want to go and look at one of these erm  er  sort of  er rather awful inner city areas.
but i suppose birmingham is not  er er.
marvellous  is it really  from that point of view.
that's right.
er where i was working erm in the.
yeah.
last er half of that year.
mm.
erm in ladywood erm er.
mm.
oh right.
erm the people who came to the youth group they.
yeah.
erm they were erm  underprivileged.
yes.
i mean the schools they went to weren't  er weren't really what i was used to  you know .
no .
yes.
yes.
"erm  but to be honest i, i think you're right about the christian angle because i do think that erm, although i enjoyed that year,."
yeah.
erm if.
yeah.
"if i had er if i could do it again i'd do something  erm really different from that,."
yes.
erm.
yes.
more practically-minded than it was.
"right, yes."
yes.
"erm because it was a, a sort of a student thing ,."
mm.
"and there was, there."
mm.
"were, there was bible teaching and all sorts but  i don't know."
i don't.
mm.
mm.
"i, i should think you're right, i would get."
yes.
er boxed in.
"well i, i think it would you know you there's, there's  i mean that's not to er deny the importance of erm er you know christian motivation,."
"no sure, mm."
it's it's just to get a look at the other side you can see that erm.
mm.
"and erm  i think too you, if, if you can think perhaps  for yourself, try and think out what you want to get this experience."
"you know what you want to get it,."
mm.
"er equipping yourself for erm er you know being er erm  er  well better able i suppose to, to work out  where you could make er a, a, a, a real contribution you know?"
mm.
mm.
"now what do you need to  know , you know, about yourself or about how you relate to particular groups of, of underprivileged erm or  er you know inadequate people, i mean people who can't cope in various ways,particular erm areas, i mean age groups or particular forms of erm  er maybe disability er or handicap or whatever,."
mm.
"which you know maybe you, you, you'd like to  erm  er see how you related to those sort of people."
mm.
erm  er it's a huge area .
yeah.
"erm and, and i think in a way you you know you may start the exploration and then that may lead you do something else, and, and you may spend  actually a bit of time before you actually want to start the training."
sure.
"you know before you're sure whether it's  cos you know if you get into probation you see, that's quite a specialized  area and, and it may i think actually it might be  it's quite difficult to get into."
mm.
"erm  er so er you know it may be that you would need to work, and i'm sure they would probably expect you to have worked with offenders erm."
mm.
"or ex-offenders or something in some  category or other, or er perhaps amongst young erm you know underprivileged groups who  provide a lot of the erm juvenile criminals."
mm.
you know you are trying to do that.
"er and also it's not always easy, i mean  there's all this youth work business and sort of detached youth work in  erm  er you know in the very underprivileged areas, but actually i, i think people say that the erm  er the disaffected teenagers are actually some of the most difficult people to relate to ."
i mean some people have a knack.
mm.
you know.
"but, but they really are quite  quite difficult you know, and almost you want your sort of most skilled  people   er doing that really erm."
mm.
and er it's a question of erm  how much challenge you want to undertake both during the placement period and immediately afterwards.
"but that's one of the strengths i suppose of the social work qualification, that it is a generic one so."
mm.
you can move about afterwards.
mm.
.
but.
"and the, and the training."
mm.
er i mean er especially.
yeah.
"er with it changing, i mean that's er it's very much."
yeah.
placement based isn't it?
oh yeah.
but you see the thing.
yeah.
er  that would be  erm  structured in a way that the people who are er training are making sure you've got the best it and are making.
mm.
sure you were.
oh yes.
erm examining what you.
yeah.
"were learning as you went along,."
yes .
yeah.
and erm.
yeah.
you know that's exactly what i want.
mm.
but i need.
mm.
this experience to get on the course.
mm.
and i need to ensure that this experience erm  well i  i need to make sure that i will be evaluating it in a similar way as i went along.
yes.
i think that's right.
"i think if you can  now, it may be that you could find a sort of semi-structured thing like the richmond fellowship."
now i've no   brief for the richmond fellowship.
"you know,."
no.
it just happens to be one that i know about.
mm.
"there may be lots of others which do very similar things, but i think this is a question of you working out the criteria for your placement that you want, you know,."
mm.
"and, and what you're trying to do and what you hope to get it,."
mm.
"erm and er then you know you'll, you'll have more of a, a shopping list  , and, and that may help you to erm actually define where you want to go within this huge range of  of er you know possibilities."
mm.
erm  i mean  there are erm  it's very interesting.
"cos there's also another area i know a bit about is, and, and don't take  these as  being the only areas, it's just it's easier if you actually discuss a  a sort of case, you know?"
mm.
erm  there's this erm rudolf steiner community which is part of the camp hill village trust.
"they actually set up villages, which are in erm  you know usually in rural er surroundings, and erm er they have erm  usually i mean they're mentally-disabled people there, and erm er they set up the village there are able- bodied people in there, and yet they live with the er mentally disabled people, you know they have houses and they the erm in inverted commas normal people have  erm   children and all this sort of thing, erm and yet they have erm er  some of these mentally defective people living with them in the house,."
mm.
and they have to you know  let their children get used to them and.
mm.
erm er  it's very interesting because the children grow up  probably much more comfortable around people who've got mental problems than you or i  would be.
mm.
"because they, they just know they're different and they, they learn a way of coping, you know?"
"and now that's a very interesting thing to see,i mean."
mm.
"erm now those sort of villages, there's one at botton village near danby, which is out near scarborough."
and you could go to that for a weekend if.
mm.
"you wanted to, to see what was going on."
and i'm sure you could have great discussions with the people there about all sorts of things.
"i mean, i mean there are er there are, i mean they probably  i think a lot of them probably are not social work qualified."
mm.
now i don't know what training they've had actually.
"erm i mean maybe they haven't had very much,but erm  but in, in a sense there's a sort of huge commitment on their part to that, because they actually, i remember some chap came over to do the talk and  i think he's got four kids and he said, well you know, i didn't know how my kids were going to react to people  fine you know."
mm.
.
"i mean you have to watch things , but you know basically it's a good experience for them."
"and erm  he said, i've got no  erm  pension or anything, you know i, cos they don't, they pool the money you see, they, and i mean they do things like erm oh i don't know have cows and make cheese and ice."
mm.
cream and grow potatoes and all this and probably they have bees and sell honey and you know they eat er they really try to be self- sufficient  sort of community as much as they can.
"obviously some things they probably have to buy, shoes and."
mm.
mm.
"that sort of thing, so they make some things and sell them."
"erm and er but he's worked at that you see, but he doesn't get any money for it i don't think."
"i don't know what they do about  must have some sort of spending money, but."
mm.
"you know it doesn't  they  they don't erm  exist in the social security system like the rest of us do,."
mm.
and therefore that community's going to have to look after him when he's old.
"and i don't know how long  don't know how long that one's been going for, but obviously that's another  sort of problem in some way."
mm.
but i mean there are huge ways of er you know very very different ways of giving service really.
mm.
and you might find out some  sort of interesting things about that.
"er the social work qualification's a good one because it, it  is a sort of base for all sorts of things, and, and you know you might learn specialist erm  i don't know, sort of therapy techniques of various sorts, but probably the social work qualification would be a good starting point to  to build from."
mm.
"you know, so erm."
good starting point  the  social work qualification .
okay.
"okay, well you know."
yeah.
mm.
and then you see where it goes on  from there.
mm.
but what if.
yes?
if erm.
well where do i go from here really?
i mean if i want.
"well i i think you, you, i, i would erm  er go and, and have another look at this alternative   thing."
the .
and obviously there are some of them which relate locally to organizations which are national.
mm.
and you could go and look at the local one and talk to the people there and see what they're doing and.
yeah.
all this sort of thing.
"erm  and i'd try and go and see the admissions person on the  c q s w here,."
right.
"erm and ask them you know and say, and if they want two years, say well you know i'm pretty keen on this, now what, you know i   necessarily expect you to have me."
when i come back and apply  but i mean.
you know what sort of things do you think i should be doing?
"and try and tell them briefly what you've done in that  sort of area you know, and, and see see what they say."
"and erm maybe have a look through erm some of the erm well there's a file on  social work isn't there and all the stuff about the qualifications, and get some of the prospectuses and so and."
mm.
erm  maybe go and see one or two others if you can get to see them.
"erm and er  you also try, so, so really it's a question of developing your own ideas about what you think  you want to explore and the sort of skills and things that you want to try and develop,."
mm.
"erm and also checking with them that you know you're not  going one way and no no , they'd want you to do something else,."
mm.
"erm and, and trying to er  er both satisfy yourself and them  that, that you know you're getting the right sort of experience."
yeah.
okay.
mm.
"and er, yeah."
i suppose i wanna be careful that  the experience i get isn't too specialist .
"well, erm."
do you think that matters or not?
mm.
"i think a lot of it is about  erm  how these er  people, you know how really a lot of the problems for people are in their relationships with the people around them,."
right.
"and, and if those are bad or not supportive enough or actually destructive,."
mm.
then you know they can't cope with it.
"and, and, and it's getting the idea of how that works  is very important."
"now you, you can do that in all sorts of ways."
mm.
"erm and er i think, i think that's one of the most important things."
"and also how erm if you are a, a helper  what sort of pressures that puts on you."
"you know, what sort of emotional stuff they try and dump on you,."
mm.
"and, and what do you do about it, you know when they er you know, i mean, i mean i think one of the things is you, you can start off erm you know very open , but if you're not careful you actually take on responsibility for them  you know in a, in a way which is actually not helpful to them and is probably very bad  for you."
mm.
because you've just taken on too much.
"and you, but you, you have to take on something."
"there's only  if the   person you're talking to thinks you don't care, well i mean they're not you know  they're not going to think very much of you are they?"
mm.
"but, but if, if they discover that  you know they can really get you erm er to er do all their worrying for them,."
mm.
er then maybe they will try and do that.
"and that's not very good, you know."
i mean your own aim is really to make yourself superfluous in the end.
"i mean you may have to support them through a  sort of bad patch, but the idea is to erm get them they can look after themselves, you know."
"and they don't really want to go on using you as a  a sort of prop, because i mean you can't afford that because you've got lots of other clients and you, you know really the aim is to try and get them back to  self-sufficiency."
mm.
"but  there is a lot of er sort of emotional interaction going on, and you'll have to get used to that."
and i mean part of the point of doing the training is to get the hang of how to handle that.
"yeah, sure."
erm.
"but, yeah and then, but er in the context of the training,."
"right, yes."
i'll be given structures in which to evaluate that and people will be continuously assessing me i suppose .
"oh yes, and seeing whether you'd  yes, how you were coping with it and whether you got too involved or whether you didn't get involved enough or whether you actually were able to sort of get this balance between erm  the sort of emotional support you give and the actual practical help which maybe they need in some sort of way, you know because i mean."
mm.
"i mean  erm and sometimes you can't give them  the practical help they need, you know,."
mm.
"because there isn't a grant or there isn't whatever it is and  you know and, and how you actually manage to  er cope with that yourself."
because you know you don't have unlimited  resources.
"in any helping profession you've usually got this problem, you haven't got enough resources."
mm.
you know.
er i mean you obviously have to make erm  decisions about that .
and the nature of caring is changing to the caring professions.
"i mean now, the erm  the social workers erm are care managers in a lot of cases, in other words it may be contracted out to somebody else to do the actual caring and you look at the package which the client is getting,you know it might be i dunno some old dear who needs  meals on wheels and visits every  week or something."
mm.
"and maybe it isn't you that do the visit, it's somebody else who's, who's being paid to do it, but you may be responsible for exercising professional judgment about whether that's the appropriate thing that should be happening and perhaps assessing whether they're doing it properly."
mm.
"now that's a comparatively new development but, but, but it's, it's coming in now."
erm.
mm.
"but i think you're right, i think if you, you can get qualified that's the thing and then you can begin to look  thereafter."
you do need to have an idea of  i think which area cos that will determine your placements and things you see.
yeah.
"well i mean all, all i know in that at the moment is that i, i'd i would be  most naturally drawn to youth, i would have thought."
"okay, well i should start there  you know, erm  and, and er see what options there are for getting involved with erm  you know young people, erm."
mm.
"and  but they are the toughest, that's the only other thing i think."
yeah.
except it may be easier for you cos you're nearer in age you see.
"but that, that causes its own problems because erm, you know, do you just become one of them or what do you do, and."
mm.
"erm well anyway,anyway."
"er but if that's what you're drawn to i should start there,."
mm.
"and, and, and see, but try and see what sort of various experiences there are."
there's also you can use one of the agencies like community service volunteers  to.
mm.
try and get a placement.
you know they're a  erm placements  agency basically.
"i mean they don't charge you anything, and er i don't think they charge the employers anything, but their is to get volunteers into appropriate places."
oh that sounds .
"erm  but even although that's their they've also only got so many places, so many."
sure.
"volunteers and they try and match them, so."
right.
"the clearer you are about what you want  er the better, you know, the more likely you are to get  er you know what's appropriate for you really."
mm.
so i think you probably need to sit down and try and think out some  criteria for yourself about what you want.
mm.
yeah.
"i mean  i'm sure you're right, but i just, i just don't know with the information i've got how to make those sort of decisions."
is it a case.
"of wading through files, or."
well erm  er yes.
can you only get those erm those.
ideas through the er placements themselves?
i mean i.
"yes, i see what you mean ."
"well to a certain extent i suppose it's true, erm but i suppose if you said, well  erm you know, can i think of skills that i need to develop?"
"erm  and er if i can, what are they?"
"and erm er what er you know how, how might  that be, be developed, you know."
and what opportunities would i have for that in these various  er situations?
you know.
mm.
i mean i think there is a danger  quite a number of the erm community service volunteer placements involve things like looking after very severely handicapped people who are erm in higher education or something.
mm.
i mean really severely handicapped so they really need sort of helpers with them for  you know fifty percent of the day or something.
mm.
well now i'm not sure that that's actually a very useful  sort of thing to do.
mm.
"i mean, i mean i'm sure it's useful in the sense that it gets one person through er doing a degree who couldn't have done it otherwise, but whether it would actually give you the sort of  experience you want, i'm much more doubtful."
mm.
and maybe you would know about that.
erm  i mean if you read er or somebody suggested that to you you might.
mm.
mm.
have a view about that.
mm.
"but i think if if you read some of the stuff and you said well, could i do that?"
would that be what i wanted to do?
"and then you thought well no, no it wouldn't because, and why wouldn't it, er but on the other hand there might be some good things about it and what were they,."
mm.
"and write them down, you know."
"er i mean i don't think you want to spend hours and hours and hours doing it, but  but, but."
"well i can't, i've got a degree to get ."
yeah.
"well you know, if you spent an afternoon looking through some of the files and what the opportunities were."
mm.
"er and i think also it should be helpful to go to er a tutor, an, an, an admissions tutor and say well you know, what, what sort of skills  do i need to get?"
what are you actually looking for?
i'll certainly get that fixed up .
yeah.
mm.
"and if, if you get  stuck with it, well come back and we'll have another  discussion, you know."
okay.
"i i think  the, the most suitable placement i've found was that one in dover but there, there, then there's the  the erm the christian motivation ."
yes.
i mean i wouldn't want to labour that too much.
mm.
er what was it there?
you.
it was er it's a residential place for.
yeah.
erm adults with learning disability.
i mean it  you know that would give you the sort working in a team and working with people and  erm.
mm.
mm.
mm.
i dunno.
it depends though.
"if you want to work with young people,."
"yeah that's true, yeah."
"maybe you should try, you know, and it may not be possible to get the  absolutely perfect answer either ."
mm.
"erm but i mean on the other hand if you start trying to develop your  criteria, and i'd go out and  look at botton village and look at  the richmond fellowship or something,."
mm.
and you know talk to people who do it .
"now  say, there's a social work contact we've got in york, who's."
"i've read that, yeah."
"well go and talk to them about it,."
mm.
"and try and find out what they want and what's happening to the social services and you know what they think about  er what they'd, what skills they'd like you to have and the sort of experience you need ."
"i think the more people you talk about it to about it the better, especially people who are in it,."
mm.
or doing the selecting for courses or for jobs .
"so maybe if you had a chat to the admissions person and a chat to the social work contact we've got in york,."
mm.
"and try and get them what skills, you know, and chuck in a few ideas of your own, you know,."
yeah .
"maybe that would, that would be good."
okay.
does that sound alright?
"yeah, that's very helpful."
good.
"okay, erm  fine."
well i should think that's probably about it then.
right.
erm.
is there anything else?
erm.
"er i'll make er other appointment, another appointment as and when i ."
"yeah, that would be fine."
"you know, i mean we're here, well are you going down   at the end of the week or something?"
or.
"erm no, i've got too much."
yeah.
", i'm gonna stay here through easter."
oh right.
"well we're, we're here easter."
"well you've probably seen, we've put a notice up on the front door to say when we're open and when we're shut over."
"the easter vac, you know, but it's really basically a week we have at easter and."
mm.
"sometimes there are odd days  in the vac when we do other things and we shut, you."
mm.
"know, but erm."
yeah.
"and you can always catch me, if making an interview is difficult in the time."
mm.
then you can catch me or one of the other careers advisors out.
mm.
in the information two till four every day.
mm.
"erm during term , unfortunately."
right.
"well i, i should have done all this last year, you know ."
yeah.
oh well.
never mind.
"it's, you're doing it now, and."
yeah.
erm  getting it right's important.
mm.
"but i think you do need to plan a bit, you know the fact you've got the degree to do, if, if you can spend time going to see these people."
"you know, you don't need to spend  ages doing it, but, but just take a bit of time to do it and."
mm.
"to have a look at the opportunities in the files, thinking about what you actually  might want to do and, and what's on offer."
mm.
right.
okay?
"right er, thanks ."
right.
jolly good.
"oh, now  i've got to stop this thing haven't i?"
oh  ?
er what happens er  i stop  .
erm right i'm new to the area and i'm wanting to move into the garden city.
"great take a seat, is it still as cold out there as it looks?"
absolutely freezing out there.
oh yuk oh horrible horrible.
okay so you're looking for a house or.
well i'm actually i'd like something cottagey if possible but erm i'm quite open minded at the moment erm i'm so new to the area i'm actually in brookmans park at the moment.
right.
but my house is on the market.
okay has that been on there long?
it's been on for about the past month.
and what sort of response are you getting on that?
not too bad had a couple of people round in the last week and one seems quite keen.
all fairly encouraging then.
"yeah, you know quite hopeful so what i as i say what i'm really looking for is i've got a preference for older properties but you know try not to pin myself down to too much at the moment, i've got about a hundred and thirty to spend  so ideally i'd like a cottage old style but i do need three bedrooms."
"o k, right."
erm ideally would like something in villages.
o k.
but something on the outskirts of the garden city might be o k perhaps on the northern side.
right o k that's fine.
um i've heard the west side's nice.
yeah west side is very popular and it tends to be the area where we get the older properties so that's encouraging.
that would suit me then wouldn't it?
"o k, with erm the three bedrooms do you have any particular requirements, do you need a garage or anything like that?"
a garage would be nice and as we've got two cars so although a garage is vital if we we can get them off the road that would be an advantage.
and the three bedrooms do you actually need three bedrooms or if a a two bedroomed cottage came up with perhaps an extra room downstairs or something would that be okay?
erm yes it should be okay perhaps you know if obviously if one bedroom a box room wouldn't be any good to us but that would be  consider that.
yep it's just that some of the cottages tend to be smaller it might well be that we can get you something where there's a perhaps ground floor extension or whatever okay.
do you need to be or have access to the railway station or to the main roads or anything like that?
it's an advantage but with cars it's not really a problem so.
"that's fine okay, smashing."
"what sort of timescale are you looking at to move, really just waiting to get a buyer on yours or."
well yes things get moving there then we would be ready really so hopefully in the next month or so.
"good, okay well let's take some details from you and what i'll do is i'll register your details onto our mailing list erm, anything that's coming onto the market you'll get a phone call on to let you know but also i'll then check and see what we've got that might suit your requirements at the moment."
so what's the name please?
"erm, it's erm."
okay and what's your address.
erm it's.
and the postcode there is?
okay is there a home telephone number for you?
erm yes it's erm would be.
okay and is there a day-time telephone number a work telephone number?
yes you could probably ring me at work yep that's more convenient so that's.
okay any extension on that or do we come straight through to you?
that'll come direct.
that's smashing okay.
"now you just said you've got your own property to sell and that's on the market at the moment okay, erm have you had any advice on mortgage and what we should be able to obtain on the mortgage side of things?"
er yes we have actually but erm.
is that from your own building society or.
well we were actually going to be going through the halifax but have you got any other suggestions?
"yes erm, we've actually linked with a firm of independent mortgage brokers erm so being tied to a particular building society as most estate agents are erm what they will do is they'll shop around and tell you which lenders are offering the best terms and particularly good schemes at any one time erm, it's literally free information they simply phone you up and say get some idea of what your salary is and what your requirements are and then they'll send through some information for you."
can i ask our adviser just to give you a free phone call?
"yeah, erm it certainly wouldn't do any harm, erm i'd rather not be rung at work if that's alright."
"no that's alright we try and keep it confidential so they work evenings they'll contact you, is there."
"yeah right well you know any time after sort of six, six thirty you should be able to catch me then."
okay and is there a particular evening that's best for you?
"erm, no most evenings it doesn't really matter no."
"that's fine, okay, smashing."
"right, well as i say i've got your details here so what i'll do is if you bear with me i'll go and a have a look through the drawers and see what we've got available."
okay?
do you just have the one office or.
"no , no we've got another office at knebworth which is a village approximately six miles north of here, what i will also be doing automatically is passing your details through to the office as you're looking for character property and village property they'll be particularly appropriate okay, but also to make life easier we actually carry their details here so anything that they've got available i'll be able to give to you now."
oh fine okay then give me a ring if anything new comes in.
i'll give you a ring if anything new comes in.
well thanks very much indeed.
thanks.
"okay, thank you bye bye."
", how did you did you find it, going back to a heavy engineering plant like  after having been at  for a while?"
well obviously erm the work that er one was engaged in in  was smaller than that er produced by  brothers.
"mainly because  brothers were attached to the shipbuilding industry, and the making of ships catapults, er arresting gears, er submarine work, erm telemeters for ships."
"erm but they did other work you know, which was of a general character."
er and they were what we would call medium to heavy type of er engineering.
er but the work was good.
"erm , on the  on the er catapults, we were capable of making a catapult erm that was so efficient, that on one particular occasion the americans and the british navy had a competition to see how many planes they could put in the air er in a certain number of minutes."
i think it was ten minutes.
and er the british catapult came out on top.
"erm we had a full load you know, in the air before the americans er were three quarters of the way through."
erm and that was using their own u s a er catapult.
"and was that the kind of er was it still all mainly military type of work that you, you were doing, even after the war?"
"no erm part of it was military, or admiralty rather."
erm most of it was the er for commercial work.
erm it took some time you know through the mid fifties to run down the wartime contracts.
"erm some firms needed about ten years er before the contract, the wartime contracts were eliminated."
er and fulfilled.
"er but  brothers er took time to get over that and er but at, at the same time were using their sales representatives to go abroad and to gain work you know, for the commercial aspect of the company."
and they were indeed successful.
"er they maintained the, the labour force."
er at one time there was just over about a thousand people employed in  brothers.
"that was the total complement, including the ."
"erm at the time when i took er office as a shop steward, er there was approximately two hundred and fifty apprentices and er there would be about six hundred shop floor workers and the rest er were complement to the staff."
the drawing office and the er  er dealt with the money side of the company.
finance.
"but erm the, the contracts that came in erm were in the main for the ship stabilizers."
and erm sir william  who was the designer of it er had designed the stabilizer in such a manner that all sorts of er materials were required for it.
"there was  loads of levers and, and er er crossheads and, and different things that gave plenty of work to our colleagues er including the housing you know, which was a huge er er piece of er welded equipment you know, built into the side of the ship."
"and the slides that were then machined and put into it the, the, the, the arm of the, the stabilizer could slip into the water you know."
erm was all fitted into these er containers.
"and it gave lots and lots of work to our colleagues and you know, when, when i say that er i think i made a comment that at that time, er  had made the, the, the comment about er the winds of change and that er you know we were never better off, well really the unemployment figures were so low at that time that it's to my mind you know, a truism."
"er notwithstanding having said that, er we were always of the opinion in the shop stewards' committee that if a man left, we would then go after the employer to re-engage someone else you know, or engage someone er in his place."
and the employer was quite responsive to that.
and so it was no problem at that time.
"but as we gradually erm worked our way into the nineteen sixties, er there were new technologies er brought into focus in  brothers, and the design particularly the stabilizer, was one thing that er brought about a dramatic change er not only design but in production."
"the swedes at one time, they designed er a stabilizer which was er a type hydraulic a mechanical hydraulic er er stabilizer, and subsequently all the materials that i was talking about, the levers and you know, all the rest of it, were not required, and it shrunk the size of the thing er so low you know, that er the british manufacturers had to look, because the swedes were then in the market er in a competitive way to take on  brothers or anybody else who were prepared to er produce them under licence."
er and the italians at that time were producing them under licence from .
"so the management looked at the, the thing very critically and they, they designed a new stabilizer erm which did away with the whole housing, which did away with the er crossheads and the slides and it was so easily produced er that we were then seeking to, to sales representatives to go out and look for other work."
"so that created a problem and we then found that a number of people were leaving  brothers to seek their fortunes elsewhere because the work that they liked to work on and you know traditionally they'd been on it for years, er was there and er subsequently there was a slip in the numbers employed."
"how did you feel about that yourself the, the way the machinery had changed er and your, your trade was obviously having to adapt to that ?"
well erm i took the view that er two things were happening.
"there were new forms of technology coming into existence then, one, we had moved the automatic er type of machinery to what they called er digital controlled and numerical controlled machines."
not computerized but digital controlled.
"where you know, the readout on the lathes etcetera er were easily seen and er easily operated."
"er there were new types of tools brought into being, er ceramic tools on the vertical boring mills."
erm they were used.
er.
i wonder if you could describe that in about er for the layman if you like.
"well they, they had gone into the production of er steel er turning er in such a way that er they looked for the best possible tools er in order, one, that they could produce the item more cheaply  as far as the employing class is concerned, they want to produce it as cheap as they can and probably sell it the dearest."
"erm but this is more or less, indigenous within the engineering industry, there is even inherent within an engineering mind, and i'm not  with the planners or the technical experts, but even in the ordinary lay engineer, he looks to be able to do the job more efficiently, with the materials that he has in hand er and possibly introduce a new type of tool if he can get the proper material, and likewise the employer was doing the same thing."
"erm and so therefore er they, they knew tools that they had been using since the period of the war, erm were gradually being overtaken by the new types of ceramic tools."
"er the ones that they fitted on the, the vertical boring mills, were round er in nature, bolted through the centre to a tool post and subsequently when they went into action, they were so hard you know, that they could outstrip the existing type of tip tool erm because the, the material itself stood up better to the cutting flow er er the, the tip tool which was inclined to chip."
"er and, and so therefore we were entering into a new phase of technology not only new types of machinery, but also to the tooling."
and then accompanying that erm there was the introduction of the er work study personnel.
the management er sought to change the type of incentive scheme that we were working on.
the new innovations that had been installed.
"and because also that it was er partly the, the directors' money that was being poured into it at that time, we knew all these things, and they were expecting a, a return back from it."
erm that er the er  management er agreed to introduce a work study system.
er now that was met with a great deal of er antipathy.
"when i say that er the existing bonus structure er although unrelated to time, was certainly related to the man's pay packet and it was given in the way of an advice note with each job, and a price attached to it."
a price.
"so the man could calculate exactly what he was earning you know, hour by hour if not day by day and week by week."
"erm so it was, it was a, it was a paradox."
"the money was removed and the new element of time on a job was applied, and er this wasn't done easily because when they introduced the work study consultants, erm we found it necessary, particularly the shop stewards found it necessary to have consultation with the management."
"one, to eliminate any feeling of antipathy er to the introduction of any new incentive scheme, but more so er to give confidence to our members that whatever happened, erm there would be a benefit."
"because  you know money-wise because we were not content to sit back and see er schemes being introduced that, which were going to act as a deterrent to er our members er being able to earn wages er on incentives and so therefore erm what happened was that we agreed that the consultants er head personnel manager would come down and talk to each group of people who were being put the incentive scheme, one, that he go over everything with them its application, and two, then answer any practical questions er where our members may find that there could be difficulties."
"er one, how they would operate it and secondly what would be expected of them, perhaps if they were attached to one of the older type machines and not the new machines you see."
"erm because new machines were costly and, and er you know, you're, we're talking a milling machine costing something like twenty five to thirty five thousand pounds."
"but the change wasn't radical, it took place over a period of er i would suggest er maybe about six or seven years."
"until all the old type of machinery you know, was overtaken by the new."
"and so whilst we were conscious of the fact that erm management were pursuing this policy to introduce the new system, we were just as conscious that we were going to protect our members er and have prior consultation, and that's the operative and effective word as far as shop stewards are concerned, to have prior consultation, before anybody accepted going the scheme."
"now the management agreed to that policy er and subsequently erm the, the main machine shop was the first er er department to go it."
"so the targets were set er and a new basis of working agreed to mutually with the management, on the understanding that er the existing piecework supplement, erm would be multiplied by three, and that meant that our colleagues were er able to earn something like er three and sixpence old money an hour, if indeed they met the target bonus."
"erm on the basis that er we were, when we were setting the, the targets, the time was set by the work study personnel erm and then the operator was able to obtain a trial run on the time given er and if at the end of the work, he was satisfied that he had made the target bonus, or near enough, or if he was satisfied that, given a little extra opportunity to go back onto that job should it come back again in the near future, then he would, he would see clearly that he could make fifty percent er which was the target bonus, and probably more."
"and so after a while erm we found that, one or two minor anomalies, er that our members were able to achieve round about forty seven, forty eight, forty nine percent."
one or two instances that were favouring the fifty percent.
"erm but, but the stewards were told that er er with all the changes that had been implemented, that our members weren't satisfied."
"and so erm we went up, i think it was about six months after it was introduced, and negotiated an increase on the bonus element."
and er that added er to our members pay packet something like another fourpence an hour.
and er they were quite happy about that.
they were quite happy.
"do you remember the time though as being, you, you certainly imply that it was a, a time when there was a quite a bit of unrest perhaps at the complexity of the scheme, as much as anything else."
"it was quite a new thing er in itself er you know it's, you, like i say, you've implied that er there was some degree of unrest on the shop floor."
yes.
"well one of the, you see, one of the strange things that happened at that time, traditionally engineers, and i think i said this in my previous statements to you, in  where there was no bonus ever adhered to, er our members looked at their, the daily production er er routine, that any interference as far as time was concerned, by the management you know, would be an intrusion on their sacrificial rites, and therefore it wasn't tolerated."
"erm they could have, to my way of thinking, have engaged in piecework or a reasonable incentive scheme, set with times and everything else, but er they didn't do that."
"alternately, in  brothers, when i arrived there, there was an existing piecework structure implemented, although not everybody was on it."
"and that created a difference of opinion between certain of our members who were not any incentive payment, those who could clearly indulge in it and, and, and make a reasonable er er profit it."
"erm when the work study  consultants came in, er we inquired one, whether their scheme was going to cover everybody because we were not satisfied that the existing scheme gave everybody the incentive that was required to keep people in harmony."
"and so we had discussions with them and i can tell you, you know, it was six months before the consultants ever made any specific move to introduce the system as such er our overtures to them, the fact that we asked regularly to meet them and to consult on various points."
"er one mainly being the, the fact that we wanted an overall scheme to cover everybody, including, including a payment for the lowest paid labourer in the shop."
that meant it went across the whole spectrum of the workforce.
"ultimately we were given that assurance and er we were quite proud of the fact that, you know, the members had gone us on the proviso that we had got that principle you know, to establish."
"and being successful in that, we then went forward to seek its application."
"but er one of the paradoxical things that happened was that immediately men are faced with, , someone standing beside them with a stopwatch,."
i was going to ask you about that.
how people.
that.
how people responded to that.
yes.
that kind of.
yes.
"well that created er a great feeling of ambiguity in the minds of our members, erm mainly i think the fact that some of our colleagues you know, may have been er apprehensive."
"er mainly because in the past they didn't have the proper equipment to do the work that they were engaged on anyway, and although their own minds would clearly tell them that they would identify the work with certain equipment you know, that was and you know, would make life easier for them and be able to produce more, i think some of them er er their minds were overshadowed by the fact that er there was a degree of mistrust between them and the management, that they would ever get the proper equipment to do the job."
"however er during the course of our er dialogues with the management, er and i must say this that er they did introduce er whenever asked, new equipment, new tools, they did everything possible to make life easier for our members er in that respect."
"and then it was clearly seen er that not only were the changes in the, the er financial er arrangements for the introduction of the bonus scheme, with the introduction of a further fourpence and hour, with the introduction of the time factor on the job, them starting, we'll say, round about forty seven, forty eight, forty nine percent, the movement was then into the fifty percent bracket, fifty five percent."
"and as they went on, you know, it was gradually working up and so therefore the graph, each man's productivity you know, was rising."
and er we were quite happy with that.
"the result was that other departments er particularly the fitters er who were still working on the old scheme, wanted to, they then wanted to come onto the scheme."
"and er that was with a great deal of persuasion er on the shop steward's part and argument with the management, and pushing the management to introduce it, er that we moved into the fitting departments."
but er.
"the management were, were clearly trying to identify the, the whole process the machine shops first of all, when they did move into the fitting er departments, they would have all the materials there necessary to, to give our members the, the feeds you know, for, for producing the er items."
"erm from from your experience in the, the negotiating of that, that kind of er deal and just from what you saw of it working in factories, er do you think that management quite explicitly sought to, to create some division or was the division that arose you're talking about the fitters being on a different scheme from the other members of the workforce?"
"well can i say that er if i might say so first of all, i think that the, the antipathy that existed for a period actually came more from the workshop, the management."
"the management er clearly desired to implement the scheme er with the minimum amount of frustration er to anyone, although you've got to understand that as an engineer working a, a big milling machine , if someone comes along and said er, you know you could stand that job on its side different to what you've got it at the moment, and you could do two faces one you know, by turning the table and you know, by use of various tools er decrease the time factor, there was the, it was a fear that our members may work themselves a job."
and i was quite conscious of that.
"but er at that time there was plenty work coming in, erm there was, there was no need for us to be apprehensive, and so therefore we had to convince the management that in the best interests of everybody, having agreed that the scheme would go on across the whole spectrum of the workforce, was to move reasonably, you know, quickly through the various machine departments and introduce with a minimum amount of frustration."
and we had to keep pushing them  all along .
it was an incentive i would say for the shop stewards.
"one, to protect the members' you know, interests in each department to see that they got the, a, a time limit you know, to go onto the scheme, that the consultation took place."
"so it was done in that manner and it was fairly reasonable er and eventually you know, everybody but everybody was, was on this scheme."
"do you remember any specific instances of er people being particularly aggravated by the fact that there were these blokes on the shop floor suggesting this job might change, and timing jobs and that kind of thing?"
"oh yes, er."
did people get aggravated by it?
"i would, i would have to be absolutely honest and that and er i wouldn't exclude myself from that particular er way of thinking because when they moved in, when you got a time for a job, erm there was one particular job that i was on erm and i thought that i was doing it reasonable accurately and rapidly, erm and they wanted to introduce a new fixture you know, i could do the whole series of faces on it."
"erm and i could see what they were after you know, an engineer has in his mind the plan and how to go about the thing and, and get it all done in a one-off situation."
"so speaking personally, when the work study man comes along, and he's timing you lifting a spanner you know, to tighten a bolt, erm and things like this, er it's a strange feeling to have someone standing looking over your shoulder and i personally er didn't see any need for that."
"er it would have been better had he perhaps said, well there's the time for the job, there's your card, there's all the operations listed for you, from one to sixteen or whatever it might be, and each one itemized you know, how long it might take."
"have a go and i'll come back in an hour and a half and, well what the work study man wanted you see, was to define whether his assessments were reasonably correct or indeed absolutely correct you know, or whether they were too loose."
"er and that the, the final analysis er time, was reasonable, because you've got to bear in mind that there was money attached to that, and if his figures are out, and your bonus effort could be increased by ten to fifteen or even twenty percent you know, then his time was considered by the management to be much too loose."
"but er yes there was a, there was er a change invoked that type of er scheme which er initially was felt by each individual er when they were work studied."
"but after a while, when they got a variety of jobs to do, they, they took off on their own initiative and in fact some of them er without even advising the, the planning department er introduced one or two minor innovations which made life easier for them the work study man's er schedule."
"and that's where engineering you know, knowledge, comes er to bear because an engineer looks for that, he looks for the easy, simplest you know er method of production er which gives him an effective er machining operation throughout the whole job."
"er and to be able to pick it off the machine at the end of the day you know, as a first class, simple object at, at a competitive price."
"and, and that's how it operated."
do you think er work practices became any more flexible with these changes?
"like did er er people begin to be asked to do different jobs whereas you described in the older days, you were very much , pinned to one machine if you like?"
yes.
"well one of the variants that, that was applied, you see under the, under the old er er time workers' er arrangements where it was only the foreman who by visual contact you know with the amount of items produced at each machine could make any reasonable assessment the individual's effort."
this was introduced in a more scientific way and subsequently erm times on machines can be measured.
"if you want to turn an object on a lathe erm and you go from one end of a shaft to the other, no matter, supposing you do it ten times, erm the machine will take that cut in exactly the same time."
you know it's a mathematical er er fact that it won't take any longer to go along.
"er and, and having established the measurement of combined with the time, er people seemed to accept the fact that this was more you know, scientific."
"and er it was accepted, but erm the, the whole structure of the system was geared to efficiency."
"and through time, the establishment became very efficient."
"not only the machine operators, but there was other things that entered into our discussion."
"timesheets, they were finally discarded and replaced by er a schedule which was a work study schedule applied to each job."
"there was a card which you received from the er clerk at the desk, they were introduced, the clerks were introduced to note everybody's time."
"erm your time was made up, it was then applied to the sheet you know, and, and there was hardly any er personal allocation you know, of, of duty filling up the timesheets."
so that was removed.
other major things er doing away with time consuming exercise travelling even to the store for tools.
"erm the tools were made up in a kit and er every time there was a work study exercise done on a job, er the tools were all numbered and laid aside and registered for that particular item."
"they were then made a sign in the store, and if the job came up again, all you did was to go down the store, and it was a one-off exercise, travelling back and forwards to get a particular tool, erm er that was all eliminated."
and you had the whole kit.
"it was easy erm, so other, other things were brought into  too drawings."
"drawings were altered er getting a whole sheet of a combined er er part of a, a steering gear or whatever it might have been, er they were all itemized and reduced to part pieces, and it was much easier to look, examine and find out what sizes were required than, you know, three dimensional er drawings."
"so it was, really everybody was brought into this."
er the only thing is that er it was the people on the workshop floor that were paid from it er the er planning er personnel or indeed the drawing office.
who came.
"in at a much later stage by the way, and presented a claim for the management you know, that they were now part of the, the whole scheme."
"did you not find that er the work them became very compartmentalized if you like, very specific people were doing bits of jobs a feeling that you were all part of a much larger thing ?"
"you know,if you see what i'm getting at."
yes indeed er there was no doubt about that.
"er i was fully aware of the fact that er you know, some people  say, particularly in the fitting departments where experience had taught the fitters, having been given a free hand, er that they accumulated all the parts for a job, or even part of the job, they did certain assemblies you know, until they got all the part pieces assembled ready to combine it into the main unit, erm that experience er was being overtaken by an introduction of smaller units being assembled you know, bit by bit as they were being produced in the machine shop."
"and this created a, a, a degree of efficiency."
"er there's no doubt in my mind that it was efficient erm and it was, it was controlling time."
"but it must have changed the, the."
and.
"the atmosphere of the job quite, quite considerably."
and.
you know.
"yes er although let me say this, that er there were many things which the management were required to do, , when we, when we went to our monthly meetings with them, we established monthly meetings with the management, one, to try and control from our side, er the, to have some control on the production er side of things."
"one, that the old type of arrangement you know, would prevail, and that subsequently if people were going to have assemblies, part assemblies before they assembled the whole unit, then whole areas would have to be cleared, new benches would have to be built, the departments would have to be totally gone through you know, and all the rubbish cleared out and, and access and egress you know, to every department to make life easier for everybody."
"er and so, to our credit er the management did this."
"it took time, it took time, it took a period of years till they got it finalized but when we got it finalized, we had er welding areas, in which was allowed in unless they were a welder you know."
or were given permission to go in.
"and the fitters worked happily in their particular section and they had everything at their disposals you know, more or less er er in the one unit."
we had the machine shops divided into the main er machine shop and the other sections.
"it was much more efficient and, and pathways and er alleyways were all cleared and lined and kept clear."
"all the er all the moulds and the part pieces were all kept, you know, in a safe position behind the lines the it was easy for people to walk up and down without fear of accident."
"and so we were complimented by some of our colleagues on the shop floor you know, that, what a difference is on the place."
you know and that this is what they were saying.
mm.
"it seems like quite a, a radical sort of transformation of the whole work environment."
"well radical in the sense that er it took, it took time."
"er but radical certainly as compared to how things operated before, when you went into the fitting shop, you know, you could, you could only walk a few feet."
mm.
before you were er trying to jump over cables and.
mhm.
and old plates and nuts and bolts and all sorts of things.
"whereas the men, the men were taught to be more tidy erm although let me say this that er if you asked jimmy  who was an old established fitter in  brothers, where you would find a certain item, you know, in the fitting department, er he could go and get it, erm but er when the new system was invoked er everybody knew that they were stored either you know to the north of the department or to the south or whatever."
everybody had an idea where they were.
yeah.
"erm maybe you could describe how er i mean, was it a big open plan type er set up?"
i mean you've described it there was over a thousand employees er and  a large operation ?
yes.
"well there was no division between the, the, well if i might say so, when the there was a fire took place in  brothers in the early sixties and it was an awful unfortunate thing."
"although, perhaps it was fortunate in one sense that er it completely destroyed the main machine shop and er it, it all happened over a period of about twenty to twenty five minutes."
room.
can you remember.
i remember er the effects of er working in the department er after the fire.
"erm we were asked by the managing director er a man called w p  whom i had a great deal of respect for, because he was a, he was a design engineer by trade and, and craft."
and there wasn't much that willy didn't know about the business.
"but that he, he was a, he was er humorous too by nature and er he was, he was quite free if you made an approach to him, and he understood that you weren't there just for fun, he would set up a meeting and discuss it with you, er and go into details and at the same time, give you an answer at the earliest possible moment."
"but after the fire er willy  er  requested you know that er the men should carry on working and, and we gave him our assurance that we would do our utmost you know, to keep the place er going."
"er but having said that er his  it was, it was terrible."
"the, , where i worked i had to bale out you know in the morning about thirty pails of water, you know before i could even see my footboard."
"and these were the type of conditions that our members worked in, whilst at the same time the management provided plastic roofing you know, but it wasn't efficient and it was cold and bitterly cold if i might say so erm for a long period."
but er to their credit er they got the contractors in and they commenced by putting up new pillars and new roofing structures and it took them about twelve months i think to actually build a new machine shop.
but during this twelve months you were still actually working ?
we were still working there.
"er but er and, and the they negotiated er a payment er for working in these er cold conditions for the men who were in the machine shop."
"but er at, the fire there was, there was a division between what they called the, the catapult shop, er the machine shop and the fitting shop."
so the new planners thought well why waste all this available space between the various shops?
"we can, we can put it all under one roof, and the the design came out er good erm you could walk from the end of the, the machine shop was extended and you could walk from there into the catapult shop directly, or straight into the er fitting base, and thence down onto the welding sections."
"erm and they, they installed heating equipment er which our members accepted with a great deal of delight."
erm because hitherto it was a very cold shop especially in the winter time when it was snowing you know.
"er i don't know if you've experience of steel but when you feel the handles of a, a lathe first thing in a morning it's like lifting pieces of ice and er the heating arrangement took about four hours before it built up you know, to a reasonable working degree."
"whereas the, the heaters that were installed went on thermostatically controlled and er when you went in the morning, the place was nice and warm and you could apply yourself to work right away."
"so when all these changes were going, going on with the, the machinery, the, the bonus system etcetera etcetera you, you think there were other facilities arose around about the same time which made the work environment still more er still better if you like?"
well the er the new building erm was certainly er safer.
"erm there were new passageways, erm the management er er applied their thoughts to it and altered the, the layout and certain machines were, were put to one side of the machine shop and, and milling machines to the other side you know."
er and it looked more regulated.
"er and the result was that the heavy casting you know, didn't have to travel    the system had to be monitored correctly, you had to see that fair play er was the order of the day both the member and indeed the management to try and reach a er an agreement."
"er but to introduce reasonable facilities for shop stewards, we had to make approaches to the management over a period of time."
"we had no place to keep our er records, we had er minute books er we used to receive minutes from the management , after our monthly meeting with them, er and they were more or less dictated by the er personnel department, who were present at the meeting."
"er and we shared the common objective that these minutes would have to be scrutinized purposefully because if there was any element er in any of the minutes that we didn't disagree with, then we would point it out to the management and had a redraft and have a signed redraft er by the secretary and the convenor, which meant that er we were all talking with a common voice."
er we instigated that procedure and then we went on to try and extend the facilities for shop stewards to be able to take care of the er problems arising the incentive scheme.
"now it took several years for er the new incentive scheme to be introduced throughout the whole of the works and i think during my last discussion you know, i did indicate that the fitters , you know, were about the last group to go on."
"er and by this time you had several departments, machine departments you know, involved in the process."
"and er that had to be regulated, regulated as far as fairness and response to er any claim that our members may make fairness you know, er and it, to enable them to reach the target bonus."
"it might have been a question of time, it may have been a question of tooling, it may have been a question of instruments, it may have been a question of materials, raw materials, or a compilation of all of these things."
"er or indeed you know, the issue er of a job which hadn't been done on a particular machine er but was timed on another one."
there was a whole host of things that had to be monitored by the stewards er on a daily basis.
"but erm happily erm we managed to deal with the matters primarily because management agreed that we would have a meeting on a monday and a meeting on a thursday, both held in the afternoon, in the last hour of the working day."
"now what happened, and it was a good procedure because what happened was that if anyone say on a friday had found himself in a difficult situation, we would then discuss it on the monday afternoon, er bearing in mind that he had taken it to the foreman and had got no response from the foreman, we could discuss it on a monday afternoon, the convenor and the secretary would deal with it the following day, and in all probability, without having recourse to take it any further, reply to the man that the matter had been resolved and, and to his liking."
"or alternately if it wasn't then we would discuss it again on the thursday and if it was a failure to agree situation, then we just registered failure to agree with the management."
and we kept these things minuted in a minute book.
er which was kept in our custody.
"so were, were management quite flexible , they, you described they allowed, stewards monitored the, the incentive scheme, er they had two weekly meetings, were management quite flexible they gave you time off or er whatever?"
"well er in the early days, erm there were occasions where erm if i may say so, that, that just to divert for a moment, the scheme had to have supervision, and there was an increase in the staff, the number of foremen and chargehands increased."
primarily because the foremen had to regulate their own department as far as er input and output was concerned.
"they had to regulate the er flow of materials, from the store to the individuals concerned."
"erm and it became too much for them because people were working more efficient, and therefore there was an increase in the productivity level, and so they had to increase the number of foremen and chargehands, which wasn't a bad thing because it was always our members that got made these respective er positions."
sometimes you lost a shop steward erm notwithstanding sometimes if the work study department needed a er an extra man er you would lose a shop steward.
mainly because the stewards had become involved in the incentive er scheme working er and had the best idea you know of how to set times and tooling and everything else.
"that's another interesting point that actually, you're saying there that shop stewards were lost er became foremen, chargehands and whatever."
did you ever have the feeling that you were almost more a part of management that you were a representative of the workforce?
well i never took that er er as a stance erm bearing in mind that er we were there as the bulwarks to defend the interests of the membership .
"it would have been rather a dangerous step to take you know, to even consider er that."
"although, , some of our colleagues on the shop floor who ran into difficulties you know, er sometimes described you as a tool of management, er which was to say the least you know, er entirely untrue."
"erm and once they got the problem resolved, you know, then they became different people."
"er and er as i say,it was a, it was a line that we could never take objectively."
"you could be you could be lured into a position where if, if the management had you by the tails, thinking along the same line, then you could never be an efficient, you know, negotiator."
"and i've got to say this, in some cases i had additional time as a shop steward and a convenor, to spend on major problems er affecting the incentive scheme."
"er and i took the time at my own risk, took the time at my own risk er primarily that very fact that you were there to support the interests of your members and else, else."
"and er happily we went along in that situation and i've got to say this er i had shop stewards who they were new shop stewards coming into the committee, weren't long in developing the same train of thought as ourselves and, and you know we dealt with things in such a manner but er we were efficient just as efficient, you know, as our members were on the production line, and perhaps more efficient than the management in determining times."
"because we knew the  speeds you know, and er the working of the machinery, the tools and equipment that were necessary to do the jobs, the, the application of er instrumentation you know, er what kind of materials ought to be used, er and, and we went into all that you know, in, setting up new times."
"again you, you never felt that you were, because you were doing that, you never had the feeling that perhaps you were becoming too much a part of management er simply representing or did you simply see it as part of your, your job to look after the incentive scheme in that way because it did er that was a part of representing the workforce?"
yes indeed er because we had an agreement and er the men that i worked beside were quite prepared to honour an agreement once it was established.
and it was to their credit that they accepted the new er system er and the new times.
"sometimes new tooling and equipment er and as i said before, a craftsman always looks to see if he can do a particular job better, if not somewhat easier er than hitherto."
"and with the help of all these er er pieces of equipment er we found that we were reaching a new standard of production, where we were increasing it er and we were able to bargain more strongly and more favourably our members."
"and as each year went along, erm we were determined as a committee erm that we would lay claims, natural justifiable claims to the employer to increase the remuneration the incentive scheme."
"and it was done successfully in  brothers, i've got to say that."
"and to the management's credit, they did respond."
"talking of the management, er how do you think their attitude changed going through your experience er of negotiation, over the years you were at ?"
well i would say that er there was a dramatic change er in the management's er er manner of dealing with things.
"we were, hitherto erm if a person had a problem regarding er his piecework, er it may never have been er er argued to the point where, when the new system came in we were educated you know to the extent where we knew how to apply ourselves to the argument."
"erm we knew that there was a certain area of profitability attached to the er scheme itself, which the management were happy to receive."
"now having said that, then we had every entitlement to argue the case you know, on a mutually agreed basis, i e to get the management to recognize that there was a fulfilment required from them to reach a mutual agreement with the individual."
or a group of individuals if it was necessary.
"er that the time could remain set at that without any departing to you know, er feelings of mistrust or anything else."
"and we built that, a feeling of trust, you know, apprehension or misapprehension er in the minds of people who were engaged on the previous scheme."
"do you think, speaking personally, that er management felt quite comfortable over the years, er more comfortable with er being round a table with stewards?"
"yes er i think that er notwithstanding the fact that we only spoke about the er incentive scheme on occasions, we reserved our er judgment when we would apply to the management to discuss certain matters."
"matters arising through the procedure from any individual or any group of individuals on the shop floor, was dealt with primarily and respectfully so the individual making an approach to the foreman, if no settlement was reached then, it was referred to the shop steward in that department, if he couldn't settle it the member with the foreman, then he could report it to the er shop stewards committee through the auspices of the secretary or the convenor."
we would then discuss it and take action.
"that procedure  became operative so effectively that i think the management subsequently realized that unless they had shop stewards who were capable of discussing the matter intently you know, and objectively, then they were on a loser, because they then stood to lose more productivity than hitherto."
"so there was the swings and roundabouts where had they not recognized and had come us, to the extent that we thought we could do our, a sharing objective er and it brought them the, the attitude that was hitherto adopted where well management really couldn't care very much you know, if a man did suffer the loss of er five pound a week or whatever you know, and, and once it was made clear to him that there was no further er er use of the procedure and he could take it through his district you know, if he liked, the man didn't, well on exceptional cases perhaps they may have taken a case through, but er in the majority of cases the man just accepted it, and made up his losses er er later on."
"but that was on a slower basis than, than he could make it up under the new scheme."
"under the new scheme, a man er with a little extra effort could afford to offset and compensate his own er er earnings."
"but the management did respond and er i think it was just the sheer pressure of the shop stewards er making continuous overtures to them on each and every problem that came up, and they were not going to be set aside er with a simple answer er that wouldn't satisfy a member."
"we made sure that er on each occasion er we reached a figure or a set of figures that would be mutually acceptable to ask the colleague or colleagues and, and then it was registered in the minutes as a, so we could refer back to er any cases er that were similar and that then made life easier for the shop stewards er who may have had a recurrence of the same problem."
"well it sounds like the procedures were quite formal, quite highly formal."
"well they were highly formal, they, and i wouldn't have had them any other way."
"because had we had them any other way, you may have fallen into the dilemma as you've suggested, that the shop stewards may have become part of the management."
erm in no way were we ever going to consider ourselves part of management.
had we done that er you would have er you would have been in queer street.
"er and in fact er i would say that had you become recognized as part of management, our members wouldn't have tolerated you as a shop steward."
"thinking about things like er the donovan commission in nineteen sixty eight, did that in any way have any influence, i mean that looked quite closely at er the state of local bargaining."
did that in any way influence you as a convenor?
"well i think that er er as i said previously, that erm the engineering industry erm for many years, er was under the influence of national wage negotiations."
"erm in the nineteen fifties and right up until i became a full time official, erm there was generated an opinion that if companies were financially , the effort of the employees, then there was some formal entitlement for employees in these particular undertakings, to put forward a separate claim at domestic level, to, to enhance their pay."
and erm well this became more or less the policy of the union.
"and notwithstanding the, the national minimum time rates were still negotiated and even today, erm our members er er helped themselves er not only through the field of increased productivity, but simply through strength of argument."
er to force the employer into a frame of mind that er well there was a bargaining unit there.
and er i don't think that donovan did anything to enhance that.
er and to give the shop stewards er a greater degree of recognition.
again it was a formalization of procedures wasn't it?
a lot of the recommendations.
that's right.
exactly so.
exactly so ken.
"er whereby the procedures er at national level, you see the procedures at national level er are quite explicit that er in the national handbook, any matter arising whereby the tools or the materials or the conditions attached to certain jobs, are offered, then our members have the right er to take the matter up with the management."
"now that applies to any matter arising, and subsequently i think that er the donovan report more or less reinforced er that particular er er procedure, although it had been written into our national agreement er as far back as i can remember."
"and er, but i felt and i feel looking back on that particular er decade between nineteen sixty and nineteen seventy, that the work which the shop steward's movement did er even in a preliminary way, the donovan report coming out, was based on reason and fair play."
many companies er were making fabulous profits and what reason was there to prevent a good shop stewards' committee from going in to try and enhance their members conditions?
"and after all you know, from all labour there is profit."
and our members share that .
"i've not, there's a conviction that er if management were making money, then why couldn't they get a reasonable increase in pay."
"now we did go through dramatic exercises in the nineteen sixties, erm where we entered into a three year agreement er on wages settlement at national level."
"erm the preponderance of our members throughout the length and breadth of the country, er initially was not to accept three year package deals."
"er and the only reason that i thought they may have been favourable, would have been based on the principle of fair play, but then erm when you think of er companies who are making profits from year to year which were the previous years, then by the time three years expired, our members could have been in a loss situation, if indeed they hadn't gone forward and argued the case at domestic level."
"now within the national settlements at that time, there was always provision left that if our members erm were pay which was more than the national minimum time rate, then that would satisfy the terms of the agreement."
. having said that there was always another clause which said that er there would be nothing to prevent our members from bargaining at domestic level.
"and that was always inherent in our minds you know, as shop stewards."
"it was a fundamental principle that we never er er er put aside, because we felt that er well as i say if, if a company was being profitable, there was every reason why we should go in and increase our members' er er standard of living."
"do you have any recollections of any particular disputes and maybe an answer that you could possibly , make a few comments on whether you felt the the procedures were worked out so finely that they in fact prevented disputes because they were so long and drawn out perhaps or er it took the fire disputes if you like?"
"i think that er one of the things that we had to examine at national level er and this was done erm after i became a full time officer, erm there'd usually be a procedure in the national agreement er whereby first of all if we registered failure to agree at domestic level, erm with the management, the next stage was to draw in the district secretary."
"er if the district secretary failed to agree, then it was referred to the divisional officer."
"at that stage the divisional officer may have taken it the domestic scene, and er put it through to glasgow if it was the, if the employer was a member of the employers' association, he would then take it to local conference."
"now local conference usually was held as quickly as possible erm but when you went to local conference as an official, you were then faced with obviously the employer who was concerned in the case, an independent chairman of the employers, but a battery of other members of the employers' association who were unattached to the actual claim itself."
and you discussed it with that body of er people at local conference.
"if you eventually failed to agree at that level, then you would have to register failure to agree as you did in all other cases you know, leading that stage."
and indicate to the employers that you were then transferring the matter to central conference.
"now central conference, by the time you went through all the stages of procedure it may take you possibly six to nine months, in some cases, sometimes it was held earlier."
but erm it could take that length of time.
"erm i remember taking two cases when the procedure was still invoked and it was a company in edinburgh, it was  as, as a matter of fact."
"and on both occasion we were successful, but there were other people there from different parts of the country, who were not successful."
"and subsequently after a long period of time, the opinions of our members generally was that we should change the, the procedure."
"and once the divisional organizer was in, that would be the terminating point of or the end of the procedure as such."
"so there would be no local conference neither would there be any central conference, and that's how it prevailed after the changes were invoked by the rule revision."
"erm i'm not so sure that in some cases er it, it's to our members benefit."
obviously erm people may argue the case with me.
"er but er in my own opinion, i think that er employers were more or less forced, in the same way as we were, to recognize that they had a problem on their hands."
"and the longer they dealt with it, the more aggravated our members could become on a shop floor, or that they could have additional disputes you know, on their hands, the fact that the dispute or the, the problem had lasted so long."
"so you don't necessarily believe that protracted negotiation er necessarily takes the heat a dispute, in fact it may worsen it?"
it could worsen it.
"on the other hand erm if you're looking at, obviously sometimes our members felt that there was a benefit, the employer wasn't getting, wasn't getting off the hook as far as the matter was concerned, the matter arising was concerned, and therefore he was left with a problem just the same as we were."
"and therefore in the interim period things had to be you know, you had to treat people fairly not to let them be of the belief er that going to er central conference was just an exercise."
"because you know both parties were there to make sure that er there was going to be a mutual agreement or it may in some instances be referred back to domestic level for resolution, or alternately, the employers just said, no and that, that was the end of it at that stage."
"and at that stage, our members were then at the at the point where they could take industrial action, if they so desired."
after notifying the executive council.
"thinking back to your time on the stewards' committee, did that situation arise er very commonly, very regularly?"
er and what was your sort of feeling at that time er about taking unofficial action ?
well er i was never of the opinion that we should be taking unofficial action.
"erm i always thought, as did most of our stewards, when i say most of out stewards, there was always the occasional steward that felt er the desire you know, was, was justified, that the matter should be dealt with now, and because the management didn't respond effectively, then we should walk out the door."
erm well that's easy.
"it's easy and it would have been easy for me to get up on a platform or to go into the department and say, look lads, you know, we feel that you're justified in walking out the door."
"but there's a procedure and the procedure, our stewards recognized that the procedure was there to be effectively operated and if words can resolve a problem, and that's how we became trained in the situation  affecting all our members."
"erm if words can resolve the problem, then at the end of the day, there's no need for a man or a body of men to lose money."
and we did that effectively.
"and that's why i'm saying that, leading the donovan report and because i was caught up in a situation my colleagues, that we were changing a system er and you know, a new incentive scheme, that we were increasing production."
"with all the oscillation that was involved in that er shop stewards taking cases up, the shop stewards discussing it with the management, the management's involvement, the management's attitude becoming gradually, not weakened but er inured to the stewards' fundamental logical claims their members, made it easier you know, and progress was, was being noted that, and earnings were rising, earnings were rising."
"and er it was, it was acceptable by our members , that we were achieving the aims and objective of the basis of the whole incentive scheme you know, notwithstanding a lot of other things that was accompanied by, because we could  we could then say to the management on most occasions, well we could do with something here that would help health and safety."
"you know, if we thought that there was a need for new boards or anything like that, it was no problem, no problem."
it was just a question of time.
"and the less of time that it took, the better."
"but we got, we got the things done in that respect."
"again taking you back to when you were a steward, erm what do you recall your relations personally and the relations generally er between the stewards and the full timers, the officials of the union?"
"well erm i've got to say this, that er as a shop steward, the record that i inherited er was one of very little confrontation between the employer and the union as far as union officials are concerned."
"and in twelve years as an experienced shop steward, i can only recall having a full time officer in i think on three occasions."
"and as i say, the more competent the stewards' committee became, the less frequent that it was necessary to have the the full time officers in."
"er if i may say so, erm it was early in our career that er in my career that er the shop stewards, we disagreed in principle with the management on an annual wage increase."
er and i think it was about nineteen sixty two or thereabouts.
"and er i was determined that er we wouldn't lose hold of this claim because it was a good claim, it was a logical claim, it was one that could be answered by the management and could be er er put into effect without any delay in time."
"there was a slight stubbornness on part of the management, simply because i think they were not, at that stage, inured to the shop steward's effective way of dealing with things."
"they wanted to push in the incentive scheme throughout the shop and they were busily engaged in doing that, and were rather blinded you know, to the claims that were coming through."
"and so to try and bring them to heel, er we referred the matter to the district."
"the district committee, the a g e w district committee, er recognized that it was something that er was a confederation exercise because it covered all aspects of the workforce, and therefore you had er engineers and, and the sheet metal workers and electricians and pattern makers, everybody within the confed in  brothers was affected by it."
so we referred it to the confed and er we had the officers down and the matter was resolved and we got our increase and it was acceptable by everybody.
erm i think that was the only occasion that we had difficulty a wages claim.
what we did have difficulty was er with an odd occasion where a man was on the verge of being dismissed.
"when i say that, he was sent up the road on suspension er with the intention of management that they would look into the case and you know, possibly dismiss."
and on this particular occasion it was a man who was engaged on admiralty work of a very er significant nature.
"er fine, fine limits in the bores of the object er piece of work that he was doing."
"and a slight slip you know, had taken him half a thou over the bore."
"now what was required then was that although the job was in a rush, the management had to telephone down to the admiralty in bath to get the appropriate sanction you know, to, to accept the cylinder with the er bigger gauge bore."
"erm and we're talking about half a thousandth of an inch, and for that you know, the man, but when i investigated the case, the man had been working on these things for about three or four weeks."
"erm his brain when you're talking about human endeavour and craft skill you know, to enable you to get to that stage of, of er er fine working, erm takes a lot of intensive you know, er er attitude."
"and the man had made a slight slip, and for that he was being penalized."
"and we, we just stood that and said to the employer, look here, if you don't bring him back on monday, erm i'm afraid there'll be nobody here tomorrow right."
"er and the management equally stood back and said, well if that's your attitude, er you can do what you like."
"so er that was a telephone call to the divisional officer, who was available at the moment and who came down and discussed it with the employer and notwithstanding that, in the afternoon i had given the management one hour to resolve the problem otherwise there was going to be a major walkout."
"and happily we got resolved, happily we got it resolved."
"erm there are days, occasions that could have sparked off major confrontation with the trade unions binding, the members binding themselves together to protect the interests of one of their colleagues."
and that's what the trade unionism is all about.
"you know, we don't stand back idly and see one man penalized."
"er and therefore when it got round the workshop what had happened and why he had been er suspended you know, initially the ire of our members rose and subsequently er the place just ground to a halt and there was a meeting and therefore we put the point to the management that er if they didn't really in a reasonable manner, then we were going."
but we resolved it and er happily the divisional organizer resolved it er i would say in about twenty minutes when he came down.
but it.
was with the pressure of the membership behind him that did it.
"were the, the stewards formally involved in disciplinary procedure?"
erm we didn't have what was known nowadays as a formal disciplinary procedure.
erm disciplinary procedures are now written into agreements with the unions.
erm but in these days erm i think that managements were in the main er fairly as far as employees' attitudes were concerned.
"employees' attitudes er were fairly stable, fairly stable and some of the work that was done was so highly skilled er that it needed a craftsman's experience to be able to get to that stage of being able to turn a job you know, to very fine limits, or to grind an objective to absolutely no limits, or to, to assemble a job with all the skill and the know-how that had been built up over his twenty five or thirty years' experience you know, his colleagues."
erm and so therefore most people were busily engaged all of the eight hour day.
and erm it was to the management's credit that we didn't need to invoke any er disciplinary procedure as such.
although it was always recognized that er there were limits to which a person could go.
"i was interested in you talking there about you know, that one, that particular case whereby one bloke was threatened with dismissal and very rapidly  the way you describe it, the men came back with a threat of strike action."
"i mean did you, do you think that that kind of feeling that kind of solidarity spread beyond  er if there was any news filtering through about another engineering factory in dispute or whatever?"
what sort of feeling was there about that kind of.
"yes i think, i think , er it, it was, it was occasionally erm heard of in other undertakings where this happened."
erm.
but i'm thinking about er disputes though not just disciplinary disputes.
yes.
yes.
"well disputes , er in different undertakings, there was a different attitude."
"erm in the dockyards, erm where conditions weren't broadly the same as was prevalent say, in  brothers or  or ."
"erm you're talking about people working outside in elements er you know, natural elements might be brought to bear in the month of january or february."
er and er a similar incident took place .
"er there would be a walkout, there would be a there would be no long discussion of it."
there would be simply a walkout and the men would stay out until management either conceded to listen to one of their representatives and resolved the matter then and there.
"what i'm driving at is, did  in your, in the time you were there ever the, the  workers ever get into a situation where they wanted to come out another dispute in another place of work?"
no.
"erm not really because, well when i say that, erm generally speaking there was this er surge towards domestic types of agreements which tended to isolate erm district action."
"at one time , you see, there used to be an edinburgh district rate way back in history."
and managements usually conformed to its application.
"if the full time officers er negotiated with you know, for a district rate, erm  brothers and, and, and er er  or whoever would concede that district rate."
"but erm, and you could always refer to it in your dialogue with them if you had a claim to make, er that they were only paying the district rate."
"on the other hand, various districts had differential rates, and those who had above yours, you normally quoted."
"and erm you could use that in your, your dialogue with the management."
"so there was always that tendency in our members minds you know to refer to various districts and er earlier in my submissions i did say that there was a disparity in earnings, especially between the scotland and england er to, to something like seven percent if not even more than that in certain undertakings."
"so you were always, you were always faced with this er coming from the membership you know, that we were always like the cow's tail you know, we'll always be behind."
er although erm basically speaking you were normally talking about basic rates earnings.
"and if you quoted the earnings some of these undertakings or districts, erm then there was a wide gap you know er which we felt the benefit of the reverse."
come in.
good morning.
hello doctor.
"now stranger, what can we do for you this morning?"
a long time.
a number of years.
"aye, it's a long number of years."
you've got spots .
mhm .
"i was told it was chicken pox, but i haven't."
mhm.
been to a doctor.
aye.
i've had this for over a fortnight.
did it just come on ?
"i think what happened it started on my legs, here."
right?
oh deary me .
"now  for a while, before i went to, i went to ."
that's turned into .
right.
it's okay.
we'll get that cleared for you.
i thought it was.
yeah.
like that.
no.
four or five days and it should all be starting to.
i hope it's not turning .
"a germ, there's a germ that floats about in the air and if it gets onto the skin when it's broken."
it.
was it?
was it originally.
.
well it looks it could well have been.
originally chicken pox?
like chicken pox.
yeah.
"but that's all it takes, it's just the skin to get broken, and underneath the skin and it just spreads and it's."
and you haven't seen my arms.
same.
alright.
okay.
my arms are really bad.
let's get that sorted for you.
it was chicken pox and i'm saying to myself it's very infectious.
"what about , is that infectious?"
yes.
that's contagious .
and the funny thing was i've.
mm.
only been off my work for about er seven days.
"i was at my work for a couple of days,."
mhm.
when this started.
yeah.
so i must have passed it on .
aye.
impetigo isn't nearly as easy to pass on as chicken pox.
"in fact it's, it's really you have to be living in the same house as somebody who's."
i was asking myself .
aye.
"you, you've got to be using that same towels, you know, that sort of thing."
aha.
"you know, actually,all more or less direct contact."
aha.
before you can pick it up.
mhm.
"so there's no terrible worry in that way, that you've passed anybody."
"and that, i wouldn't worry about that."
get that thing?
"ah, you could get it anywhere, i mean even, see the likes of that, that wee cut in the back of my hand?"
aha.
well it could start off in that.
just  just .
"see i always wondered because er  it seemed awfully slow in spreading it, it was there."
that's right.
"and a couple of days with nothing happening i'm saying, well, it's started clearing up, but then."
and then it moved somewhere else.
it moved somewhere else and i'm saying i'm looking at it.
that's right.
the only place i've not got it is my abdomen and my chest.
right down the front.
it had nowhere to go.
aye.
"and it started on my back quite , three of four days ago, well it's not just as bad but my arms are real bad."
right.
let's see if we can get you turned into a human being.
"oh dear, and i'm saying to myself it was chicken pox."
"aye, but."
i don't think i've heard of that impetigo doctor to be honest.
yeah.
it's years and .
it used to be quite a common thing.
yes.
correct.
"aye, i remember."
"ah, but it's you still see it, i mean we still see it about once or twice every week."
mhm.
but i mean it used to be every day.
aye.
we used to see it.
"so, it all cleared up okay?"
it won't.
yes.
och aye.
leave a lot of marks?
no?
"well, i suppose it ."
hopefully not.
no.
no.
no.
"not nowadays, not with the, not with the stuff we get nowadays."
now.
now.
now.
and what i've noticed is i've seen my bed linen.
it's been weeping at night when i'm sleeping.
that's right.
that's right.
in your sleep.
that's right.
most of this is drying up but the skull must get it seems to.
right.
weep.
that's right.
"when the skin when we move around in the bed, the skin cracks open."
"oh that's it,."
it's all cracking here.
aye.
mhm.
and the same with the crusty bits.
oh aye.
", when you move around at night it's the crust cracks open."
mm.
"and you get this weepy, sticky."
aha.
yucky er yellowy green.
that's correct.
aye.
coming out.
"that's right, isn't it?"
that's it.
that's er here you are young william and that should get rid of that for you no bother .
right and er.
"two things, you've got a special stuff for during the day and a different stuff for bedtime."
aha.
is it.
is it oral?
or what is it er?
tablets.
both of them's tablets?
both tablets.
both tablets to take.
aha.
and that'll get rid of that for you.
so i can get in ?
what about work?
anything.
i can go to work?
yeah.
"i feel , i feel embarrassed ."
aye.
the only thing about work is are you working with oil?
"i do work with oil, aye."
"ah well, no chance."
no chance cos that.
i'm working on thursday so i'm.
aye.
but i work with turbines and it's.
aye.
no.
"it's for your own sake, because the if the oil gets underneath the skin it can irritate your skin."
aha.
so you're better er out the way of that for  a week.
?
or so.
yeah.
"how are you keeping yourself, doctor?"
me?
fine.
"oh, good."
.
don't have much choice.
i would say i've been pretty lucky recently myself .
"oh, that's a good way to be."
it's a good time to be a stranger in here.
"guilty, you know?"
right.
see if we can keep it that way for another twenty years.
aha.
right.
thanks doctor .
okay.
right.
much obliged.
"so, what will i."

and do you have any brothers and sisters?
i have one sister still alive.
i had er two brothers and four sisters.
"but they er my two brothers, one died in nineteen forty."
the result of well wounds.
the other died at the age of what?
oh about ten years ago.
"he was eighty nine when he died, and er both of them were in the family tradition, journalists."
and in fact er one my brother to me i was the middle of them i was the youngest boy.
male they call it.
his son is a was former corresponder for in new york for the guardian.
"now he's on the editorial and billy, my eldest brother he er was he came up  in glasgow er  getting the scottish express."
"you see so a branch of the er london paper and at that time he was editor of the paper, they came up together, found it here."

ooh.
and my sisters  three of them were teachers.
and er an interesting thing   had been coming to our house she comes  goes to the same church.
"and she came up on a wednesday for coffee, after the service."
"and she'd been coming to our house, oh about fie or six years, and she said one day to mary, that's my wife, says you know, not  strange name, there's not many of them about."
"so i says no, when we had the phone first we were the only one in the telephone directory."
"and i says er you know when i came back from rio de janeiro, she'd been out as a kiddy then."
my teacher was a miss .
"and mary said yes, that would be eric's sister."
"she was she taught in pennycook for quite a while, then she went down to birmingham."
"the other sister was er in high wycombe,and the other one was in er well she was in creith for a number of years,and then she moved south because she wasn't musical and there was no chance of getting of headmistresship in scotland if you hadn't got music."
so she went down to spalding and was headmistress of er  school in spalding.
until she well not until she till she until she retired.
she died a couple of years er three years ago.
"so er and ten the other one, the one that's alive she started off teaching and then went to nurse."
"she wanted to be a nurse all her life, you see?"

"and my father, he was in  he had a local paper."
was he editor of the local paper?
"well he was editor, you know, in a a small time a small of er about five or six thousand."
"everybody has more or less has a paper  it's not like the scotsman or the news, numbers, but then you've got all the local news and you got all the local advertisements."
"so journalism is one of the family, what if i say traditions?"

and was it a big house or?
"well it was a reasonable house, you know."
one two three three little rooms downstairs.
upstairs there be there was four rooms upstairs.
but at that time it wasn't what you'd call modern you hadn't got hot water  from a sort of gas electric heating.
"the bath, you had a bath room with a bath on the wall  but you had to heat the water on a at the kitchen the kitchen fire."
it were a  kitchen range where you'd got a an oven on one side and a boiler on the other.
"the boiler didn't fill automatic, you had you had to fill it with water."
"you took took a bucket of water out, you put a bucket of water in."
that's how you heated that's how you got your bath.
"heating the water, well it heated if you'd the fire on it heated the water and then you'd take a couple of buckets out into the bath, plug a couple of buckets in."
and then er.
and there was no no such thing as electricity.
gas  there was a local gas works you see?
that made er the gas locally.
but i remember quite well when the first incandescent gas mantles came in.
"you know, what a novelty it was, and the difference in the light between the old single  gas lighter and the incandescent lighter."
but er some of some you had no gas up the on the stair way.
the gas the stairs were lightened with a a paraffin lamp.
you know.
"gas in the bedrooms, so as the."
"the was gas in the bedrooms, but not on."
but not on the.
not on the stairway.
why?
i don't know.
mhm.
there was warm gas er in the hall.
"you know a gas er light in the hall but the less the stairway, you either had to go up by er with a candle in your hand, you see?"
"or you got well er one two three four, there were four flights of stairs, in the one house."
"you got a couple of lamps either, well in the one case where there was a small landing, a hanging lamp and the other bigger, you had a table, you had a an ordinary table lamp."
oh yes.
and you'd.
"and you'd have the fires, open fires in your rooms."
oh they were all coal fires.
there there were no such thing as gas fires.
they were open coal fires.
"and one well all the bedrooms had er fire places, you see?"
in the winter time you put on a a coal fire.
but there were no no such things as central heating and that.
and er where did you start school?

it was.
small school?
no it was girran high school was very good.
"very good school, very good  teachers."
"the headmaster was morgan j , known as morgan j or by the boys as too long and too loose."
why?
"because he always had long trousers that went over his boots, and they were you know, very wide so the boys would call him too long and too loose."
yes.
ooh there were all all there were with one exception they were all male teachers.
"the the exception was the art mistress, she was a er miss , but er morgan  ,,,,, all good and by you couldn't you know they were disciplinarians, strong disciplinarians, there was another chap."
"left girran, went from girran down to oxford as professor of latin."
and  he stayed there for the rest of his life.
and morgan j well he was the headmaster when i went to school first and he was there when i left and he retired and he was still here you know going about.
"there was ,, and another chap."
"there were four headmasters and they from not from girran because there was only the one high school, but from er prestwick,glenbuck and that, and the used to meet on a saturday at turnbelly to play golf."
they played golf every saturday if it was possible.
and was the belt used a lot?
pardon?
was the belt used a lot?
no.
because you didn't get the you know.
"one one boy might have  had the belt, say once in the week or a month, at girran."
"very seldom, there was no need."
"you know, you might get the belt for making a silly mistake over a sum, or some exercise or that, you see?"
or coming in coming late.
"but it very the belt was there, now in the classroom the master had a desk and at the side of the desk was the belt."
"it was always on show, but it was seldom used."
you know er very very seldom.
"and how did you learn to count, can you remember?"
did you use the abacus?
how did you learn to count ?
"to count , aha."
when you went?
"you started, i forget  one, you know they'd put them on the it was all board and slates, there were no books, you know, no papers."
"you had a a slate like you've got on the roof, but it it was bound with a wooden frame."
and on the board was a one.
and you out that one on your slate.
"and then two, and you put the two."
"then add, you'd put a plus sign, one and equal, two and two plus two equalled four."
like that.
"and the same when it came to er subtracting, you see, it were all done on the board and you copied it onto your plate your slate."
and from that you learned.
"and you had a bit of rage or duster or something, you'd got your slate filled, you'd just wiped it up, and dried it, start again."
", literally speaking, there were no records of your early."
"er training , subtraction and that."
"when you went into the er higher grade, then you got jotters, because you had homework, so you'd homework to do and you'd, therefore, books."
you could er give your translation  you see?
or  all that.
"you had your latin, french, if you didn't if you didn't take french you took german."
your maths and your science.
and your  own jotters.
"and your homework was handed in  , you know, you may have homework, english."
"and essay, write an essay on this, that or the next thing, at the weekend."
"it went into your jotter, your jotter was handed in on the monday morning, or the first time you went to the the english class and the teacher  was his name, he went over that and if you'd missed out a comma, you see or a full stop or anything like that."
"he corrected them, more or less, marked in up, and you got er four ten, five ten, ten ten."
and did you stay at the same school through primary and secondary?
yes.
one school.
"the the only difference in, were different sizes of the room."
you see the primary was in the one side and the high school the secondary was in the other.
"and were did the classrooms, how were the classrooms heated then?"
"they were in desks, you had a long desk that took now some of them they took five on the one the one desk, you see?"
a long desk and a long seat.
no individual desks.
and the boys say on the one side and the girls on the other.
mm.
and how were the classrooms heated?
can you remember?
"well the classrooms were kept clean because the school finished at er twenty past four and half past four the janitor had the cleaners, you see?"
mrs a had somebody  mrs b mrs c mrs d.
they were always they were swept every day and at the weekends.
"one room would be the floors would all be scrubbed and polished, next week the next room."
"the next room, then come back."
the rooms were scrubbed.
"when you sat your qualifying exam to go to the high school, er what happened to the people who didn't pass?"
"they were it were divided into to, you could go to a high, or you could carry on at what they call supplementary."
if you didn't get the if you didn't pass the class exam you could stay on and try again.
that never happened.
if you didn't get it you went in to the supplementary.
"if you got it you could go in to the higher, if you didn't want to go into the higher you  leave at er thirteen, you went into the supplementary."
"it was er just er well it was between, shall we say, the higher grade and the secondary school."
continuation of further education on the secondary lines.
"the only thing in the supplementary you didn't get was languages, but you got the the math, the science and all that, and english."
so did you enjoy school?
yes.
it was good.
and did you have sport?
"you had you had no organized sport you have today, but you had a football team because there was no need for what you would call sports ground, there was plenty of available open space, park."
"there was the  stead park, which practically covered  the whole of our the er town you see?"
"you if you lived in stead park, the houses in stead park looked straight across the green onto the sea."
"you've got football pitches there, with cricket pitches but if you wanted, if you were a golfer you went across to the golf course."
but there wasn't what you'd call an organized sports group.
"if you wanted to play, class four would play class three, class three play class two, you know?"
but the teachers didn't organize it?
no no.
you the boys organized it.
the boys organized it themselves.
"and girls, well er about the only thing they did was skip."
"you know, skipping ropes."
and what did you do with your er spare time as a school boy?
"i spare time as a school boy, i used to play either football in the winter or cricket in the summer."
"when i had spare time, but if you'd if it was decent weather you'd have to give a hand in the garden at home you see?"
"you had to help get the garden keep the garden tidy, keep the weeds down."
"it's alright at although i'd two brothers, on or two would be home from home at the the same time."
i was left.
"so i had to give me father a hand, you know, to keep the garden, and he had plenty to do."
so er they'd find you something to do in the garden in your time.
did you find that your father would have odd hours?
"well er sometimes he he made of point of always being in the house not later than we'll say nine o'clock, unless there was something special on."
you know a meeting of the town council.
well if there was a meeting of the town council it would perhaps start at eight o'clock.
"because quite a a number of members of the council had businesses and you didn't shut at six o'clock, it was seven or eight 'clock before they closed."
and if there was a town council meeting it might go on till ten o'clock.
so if the you know it was only er exceptional cases when he was late.
did the paper er he had out every day?
no it was a weekly paper.
a weekly paper you see?
"and er later on when he well he got that he couldn't carry on with it, you see."
"it was absorbed and went in to the carrick herald and the aire advertiser, and now they've all gone."
i don't think there's a sort of local paper now.
course i haven't been down that way for a while.
and when you left school what er age were you?
i was between fifteen and sixteen.
and what did you go what did you do?
i had a relation with a chemist business in motherwell.
"and er i didn't know him, you know, my mother  he was a cousin of my mother's you see, and on call now and again."
"it wasn't like today, you could get in the car and nip down."
to get to girran you've got to go into glasgow and get a train from glasgow down to girran you see?
and that was er an express train was two hours journey.
"so and er i smelt, you know, and i went by a chemical  and i thought  oh  oh, grapes, the the odour you see?"
and that drew me.
the aroma that exuded from the chemist shop in those days like er depends what they'd been using you see?
"they'd been making er some mixed powder, fenugreek or something like that you see?"
you get the aroma of it.
"and er well there were three chemists in girran  w k , archie  and gib ."
"well w k  never took an apprentice, he wouldn't you know, he hadn't time, he had a permanent assistants like."
"he wouldn't he wouldn't take in ion an apprentice, it was too much."
"so i got in to gib n as an apprentice on the second of august, nineteen twelve i think."
"nineteen and eleven or twelve and er he was a figure in the in the town, when i tell you, you won't remember the  who were members of parliament for orkney and shetland."
and if punch were ever stuck he would get a cartoon of er one or other of the brothers sitting in parliament knitting.
you know whistling and knitting.
"well this man  something wrong and he er had an appointment with a girran man who was professor of medicine in glasgow, he'd gone up the ladder you know and finished."
and he made an appointment.
"well  came from bar which is er a matter of six miles, six to eight miles out side girran and you'd got to come in by foot or by trap."
in those days he came in with a his coachman brought him in the trap and they got the twenty minutes past seven express train to glasgow.
"well er he saw the professor and paid the fee and that and then came back six =clock at night, he came into the shop."
and he said he says  is er gib in?
well the assistant said no er ah he's upstairs getting his tea.
"stayed above the shop, you see?"
in the house.
but he said wait a minute i hear him coming down the stairs.
"so the boss came down the stairs and into the shop and he saw  oh hello, well did you get on with the  your examination?"
"ah well he says,and he said he's given me this list."
if you can't get if you  give me something of your own.
"after he travelled to glasgow, he had more faith in the  he'd more, you know,."
mhm.
"if  had said oh this isn't worth a damn, take this, he would have taken it and been happy."
mhm.
"and oh  no he said, this'll be good, you know."
so can you remember your your wage when you went first?
when i started first it was five pounds a year.
and were you paid at six months or were paid every.
no  paid every three months.
"and invariably you got a gold sovereign, you see?"
"and er what,four   the rest  i think it was one pound five a twenty five shillings every three months and you got a sovereign and often a five shilling piece."
if you didn't get the five shilling piece you got two half crowns.
then it  gradually went from five pounds to ten.
there was a five pound increase every year you see?
and what er was your job when you first started?
when you first started you had the hallmark of an apprentice of black apron with a bib on it.
you know er you see some of them with the apron that just goes round the waist.
"but this one came up over neck, over your neck, and then down here and strings there."
and you did two years as an apprentice then another would come in and you dropped the bib and got a black apron.
"when your apprenticeship was finished, you got a white apron."
how long was the apprenticeship.
"the apprentice varied three years , some of them were five."
and what did you do as an apprentice ?
"the first thing you were shown, taught to do, was to wash the bottles."
"you know, empty medicine bottles."
you washed them.
"the er apparatus,measures, slabs, mortars, that were used for making compounds or dispensing medicines."
they were put on the sink and you washed them.
and dried them and put them on the rack again.
and gradually  dust or you've seen these er chemist shops where you've got lots of er drawers in.
"well in my day, all those drawers had the natural drug."
"aconite root,inside was a small cardboard label, you see?"
"giving the whole story rad aconite,beruncial assay britain, habitat britain."
"use, root, liniment, you see?"
"and you had to do all that dusting and keep it and you'd read over all these things, every time you dusted until you got to know them."
that was.
one of the ways of training you or breaking you in to what was materia the materia medica of the pharmacy.
"if he today er you don't hear such thing as aconite liniment, belladonna liniment."
extract of belladonna.
"dandelion juice,succus delaxica they've been replaced."
"then, you see, at certain periods of the years herbs were common, bloom, which a lot of it was used."
you used to go with the boss.
"the boss would cut the bloom, you would put it into the sack, bring it back to the shop and dry it."
"you might go and collect, oh  er what coliupe collium, collium maculatum,spotted   come up, you'd go and cut it, you know, bring it in, get the succus conium that would keep you going, you know, sometimes he would he'd say oh blast you, we used two garlands of it."
we better get three garlands this year .
"ooh we made three garlands last year, we've got two garlands left, we'll not bother."
but a lot of the herbs were collected and dried and er used.
so it was organized collecting of.
well the  usually collected himself.
"er we was on the beach, you know sea front, he'd er gathered some er brands of seaweed for making what they call irish moss,caragium and that would give you a good  think emulsion, you see then in the, what was the cod season, cod fishing, you'd go down to the harbour where the er fishing boat came in and where they were cleaning, and you'd get the boss would have arranged that you get the cod's livers."
"take it back to the shop, in you've seen these old milk churns."
well i fill the milk churns with the livers and take them the shop.
"go back and get another, you see?"
get another.
"make your own, produce your own cod liver oil."
gosh.
and er there were two grades of it.
"there was the the cod liver what would for animals, that well, the method that used to be used, put it into the copper boiler."
"a big copper boiler, with a little warm water and the heat would separate the oil, you see?"
and then skim the oil off and drain it.
what extra did you have to do for humans?
"well you were always one thing you were very careful, you had to see that the gall bladder was removed."
that it was just the liver.
"and sometimes you just used pressure, you see?"
"put it in and screw it round and round and round, the pressure would fetch out the oil."
"i can remember when the er going down to the harbour for salt and we were getting from the manufacturer, it was  at the time, getting cod liver oil, you know, ready prepared for us which was a quite a saving."
as far as we were concerned.
in labour.
"but er you had all like cold cream, special hairs tonics, rosemary , eucalyptus hair tonics."
you made those in the back shop.
"and having made a couple of winchesters, that's er the big bottle, which was er eighty ounces."
"they were filled into two ounce, four ounce or, you know, the size you you stocked and sold."
are they the chemist then would have to buy in all the bottles.
"oh he bought in the bottles, you see?"
"and er you gave in perhaps say er two gross of three ounce bottles, two gross of two ounce bottles, four gross of four ounce, depends how they were used."
"and they were stored in the back in the back shop store, you see?"
"and er kept there, then you had in the front shop, you had a range of er hair er  drawers with your drugs, your  drugs at the bottom."
"you pulled it down ad you got the various size bottles in this we got half and one ounce, here two ounce, further up three ounce."
all the way round.
when you got the bottles did they have to be cleaned?
yes.
cleaned and dried.
so it was a lot of work?
oh lot of work.
"i mean the bottles weren't what you'd call dirty, from having contained medicine or anything like that."
they were dirty from  transit you see?
and packing.
"they just needed more or less  scrubbing out and put on put into drainers, you know just a big piece of wood with holes cut in you could fit them in and wouldn't fall off, and dry them over the heat."
what did you use to heat?
there's only source of heat.
any of these.
"the great thing is if you've got faith in the stuff  if you haven't got faith, you needn't bother with it."
that's my opinion.
and what do you feel about er the new er.
there are some of them that are very useful but in the majority of cases if the human is functioning well it's producing it's own steroids.
"and those people that take or get extra, either their body is not producing or they want an extra bit for something so they can run a hundred yards at er in an extra five minutes."
but you don't feel that these things are not really proven are they?
no.
they have quite disastrous side effects on the.
er they have well just the same as er some of these weight reducers. they'll take the weight down but look at the side effects.
oh yes it's er no i think there if we just bothered there are enough or almost enough herbs to cure any most of the common troubles.
and do you feel nationalization was good from the medical point of view or?
well yes and no.
"people stared running to their doctor  cut finger,where previous they would have said, oh i'll have a an aspirin and a cup of tea."
i'll put a bit of adhesive plaster around this.
"i think at times the national health service has been exploited, you know, oh er i am no going out today, i'm no feeling well."
i'll go and get the go and see the doctor.
"a sick thing, he's off for a week."
"if we had some method a a laser of some kind that could measure the degree of pain that mrs a is supposed to be suffering, it would  it'd solve a lot of problems."
mm.
remember what it was like during the nineteen twenty six strike ?
"the nineteen twenty six strike, the the thing that struck me most of all was, they were going to  out the railway men."
and at that time the railway was it was private.
and the leading man of the railway union went out and bought all the shares he could get his hands on and off the railway company.
and he'll not come out on strike.
and that's and er it was the railway men not coming out on strike that caused the collapse of the strike.
but there wasn't much interference in in edinburgh.
as far as i can remember.
"i mean we could get about, we got about alright."
there's.
there was food and all that available.
"oh no i the twenty six strike er is just a you know a very very big and er  you know er railway man, leader of the strike, buying all the shares because he was but that's one of the things, because it was a headline in the."
paper.
papers.
"i see, so coming back to er making the pills and silver on it and gold, was this er sort of foe the aristocracy more?"
no no.
no.
no.
no.
"anybody you know, er it sometimes does work, very keen on a nice appearance you see, that the drug be have a nice appearance and so the had silver coated."
no no it wasn't i seen i seen people in the pleasance being  silver coated pills.
and you wouldn't say that was no.
"how do you feel, the sort of looking back on life, sort of the difference now u when you were young?"
"well, how do i feel?"
"i'm grateful that i was born when i was, being a youngster today."
although i have well i've come through two wars and i remember the relief of mathaking but i'd sooner that i've was born when i was.
why?
"well today it i may be wrong, i hope i am, but it seems to me, everybody is out, you know, oh he gets five bob i want seven and six, he get's seven and six, i want ten."
"and there seems to be dissatisfaction, greed, i dunno what amongst the youngsters today."
and what did you do as er your leisure time as a a young man and?
"well, you hadn't got a great deal of money, now  you would go for a walk out in edinburgh, out to black blackhole because blackhole was a village."
or you'd go down the er out to barton and down the side of armand up and back again.
"you had a a  walk saturday morning, when  saturday morning."
"i went for a game of golf, i had nine holes."
i was a member of er ravelston why?
"it was very easy, i could walk ravelston nine holes, walk back in time."
"or i got a garden, i could occupy myself in the garden."
i never felt time hanging.
"ooh well you got er a a lecture a couple of lectures every day, well you you couldn't just er press a button and they came out, you got er preparation work."
enjoyed lecturing?
yes.
and.
i made many of my own students are still friends.
"now  we're off christmas, we've  we have had christmas cards from norway, indonesia, mauritius, northern island not to mention the er scotland and england."
but these are from students of  well past days.
so it's very nice.
so well er i had students and they left at as friends.
"if if we had overseas students, you know er somebody from zambia or what er people afro asians or indonesians or something like."
"well they were they were coloured, well it didn't matter to me."
"my wife kept an open door for them and any time well at the weekend they'd some of them would drop in, you know, for a chat, aye."
or drop in for tea or supper.
"i was much more, well  i'll not say interested altogether, but much more thoughtful of the condition of er these coloured people."
why?
"well a biddy ago now, a nigerian came to edinburgh, a student, went to the regular places."
"no no to let, advertising they wouldn't have him, well what's that?"
what impression is that going to have on that laddie?
"so but er the overseas fellow, you know i'll consider just on the same level, and well i never saw any er what you'd call bickering and biding between the black and the white student."
"and the u a couple of them would come, a black and a white would be here and no bother ."
but there you are.
did you find that through the years the classes got bigger?
that that you lectured to?
well the classes remained steady.
"you know we could've we limited they were limited to the intake, but we could have er increased i think."
"we kept a steady increase, you see when the two year course stared first, i think we had eight students, and then it grew, you see."
"the next year the eight to the final year, there's sixteen the next year until we were getting that the two year course was just as big as the old one year course."
"and you got er eighty four students first year, eighty four students second tear, that's a hundred and sixty eight students."
oh but we got on.
oh yes.
"and did you find that the text book they had to use, changed through the years or just the."
well.
of the same text.
no.
books.
they're they are pretty much the same.
"the chemistry text books and the physics changed, they got more what you would call mathematical."
but you can't mathematize the making of an ointment or the making of an infusion.
"they're perhaps little er more about the condition of the granules of a powder used for compressing into tablets, and the coating, how shall we coat it it  washed away , dissolved slowly or anything like that."
"yes, that was a big change really wasn't it ?"
yes.
coating.
coating.
yes.
you could get the slow and coating the granules before compression.
mm.
er you get a slow or a retarded er effect or solution rather absorption.
oh yes.
come in.
"doctor , as you're finished would you mind seeing the next ?"
no problem.
thank you.
esther .
she's supposed to have tamazepan and frumil is it okay for her to take these?
yes.
so you've just changed them?
.
aye.
fine.
eh?
right.
"yeah, she's alright."
she won't die with those.
